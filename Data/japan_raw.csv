These stupid wars every couple years need to end so we can get on track to making humanity better.,0
"> Japan has been highly dependent on crude oil imports from the Middle East and has traditionally maintained friendly relations with Arab countries as well as Israel, which has been strongly backed by Tokyo's key security ally, the United States.

Important point commenters here may have missed.",0
I hope that they can also move towards recognising Palestine as a state.,1
"I hope its actual aid, not fungible funding for future Rockets.",0
provide $65 million to Hamas*,1
"Providing aid to Gaza right now puts every nation between a rock and a hard place. We know that the *Palestinians* need as much help as possible, but the only way to give any aid is through the controlling authorities, ie, Hamas.

So no matter what if you hope any of the aid trickles through to the people who need it, you're still going to have to let the terrorists (because yes, Hamas are terrorists, to both Israel and the Palestinians) skim resources off the top, if not just keep most of it. 

I wouldn't be surprised if only a small fraction of this $65 million aide actually gets to the people it was designed to help.",1
"The Israelis have no where to go. Their people came from the Land of Canaan otherwise the Land of Judea, which is otherwise modern day Israel. Arabs are the descendants of ancient Assyrians, and most of the Muslim counterparts occupy most the Middle East, whereas the Israelis only have Israel pretty much, give them that much at most. Arab Muslims have many alternative lands to occupy, it’ll be much more different for the Israelis to occupy than the Palestinians would just bc most aren’t Muslim.",-1
Palestinians need it significantly more if you haven’t been keeping up with the news.,1
We got to do a lot of things but I’d say helping a country experiencing ethnic cleansing and genocide justifies some charity.  Especially given Japan’s history being the victim of 2 A-bombs and tons of carpet bombing over civilians.,1
Perhaps the world should unite against hamas and let the UN install an interim government which is more peaceful and compliant with the 2 state solition,-1
"You seem to have a cursory understanding of the history of Israel. Who do you think actually displaced the Jews? 

> As a result of the Jewish-Roman Wars in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, many Jews were killed, displaced or sold into slavery.[8][9][10][11] Following the advent of Christianity, which was adopted by the Greco-Roman world under the influence of the Roman Empire, the region's demographics shifted towards newfound Christians, who replaced Jews as the majority of the population by the 4th century. However, shortly after Islam was consolidated across the Arabian Peninsula under Muhammad, Byzantine Christian rule over the Land of Israel was superseded by the Arab conquest of the Levant in the 7th century.

Seems like a classic case of white guilt to me. One that Palestinians have to pay for.",-1
I’m sorry to hear.  On the bright side you’re not being bombed or having your family annihilated.  Things may seem rough but they can always be worse.,1
"If you're gonna sit here and tell a half baked story to suit your narrative go for it, but I personally find it more important to highlight the state of apartheid that Palestinians have been living under for 75 years. Palestinians want to be liberated. Saying that the goal of Hamas is to destroy Israel and ending the argument there, kind of hides how Israel is a fascist country who wants to wipe Palestinians out of the map, and constantly lie in order to do so. Hamas exist because of Israel, because extremists movement occur when people live under extreme situations. Like, genuinely piss off. Your comment is just misinformed it frustrates me to read it.",1
"Funny, I'm seeing Israel doing all of the murdering. Also hearing Israeli leaders calling for the extermination of Palestine so I think you might have your wires crossed.",1
"Yes like the red cross, so they can then give it to hamas",0
This! Saw some images japanese aid were diverted to Hamas military infrastructure and equipment. So sad these may have helped in terrorism,1
"Well, some may have already read this and therefor thought Japan was announcing an additional $65 million",0
"Huh? Im no accomplished historian but I do know they went into exile in the beginning of the 1st-2nd centuries by the Romans under Titus. Oh so just bc you write down a data spread of approximate times the Roman occupied Ancient Judean land of Israel was conquered and their migratory paths thereafter that makes you a more credible source of information when all I was doing was providing a rough summary of their homeland? Jeez.. get off my ass. This long history of fighting is not a new one and Palestinians are not the victims here. Both have killed back and forth at each others necks since before the year 0, at this point both are guilty, and the occupation of Jerusalem and the Holy Land is only up to who reigns victorious at the end of the day. The Bible was written and documented history that the Israelites were the original settlers of Judea, if it’s about who was first that’s your answer. This isn’t me firing shots at Islam, its stated in the Bible. It was written 600 years before Islam started with Mohammad and even before the Quran was ever written. I’m not even white bruv.",-1
"Hamas was elected to represent the Palestinians. Hamas has never hidden their intentions, it's not as if the people voted for Hamas under false pretense.

A right wing extremist killed Rabin. Being Zionist is unrelated to being a right wing extremist.",1
"\> Saying that the goal of Hamas is to destroy Israel

The Hamas Charter of 1988 explicitly called for the killing of Jews.In 2017 they removed those clauses, but the actions of Hamas on October 7th have shown that their target is essentially any Jews that they can find.

&#x200B;

\> Israel is a fascist country

Israel is a liberal democracy.",1
"That is a false narrative, amilelka.  Hamas committed murder by going into homes and nearly decapitating kids and parents.  Hamas committed murder by kidnapping Jewish concertgoers and then raped them, beat them, drove their mutilated corpses through the streets, and then dismembered their bodies.  

Israel retaliated by launching a military campaign against Hamas.  Hamas hides among its civilians.  Israel has no choice but to attack them where they stand.  If Hamas fielded a standing army and met Israel on the field of combat, where civilian casualties would be low, Israel would rather prefer that.  Ask yourself one thing: Who fights to kill more Palestinians: The IDF with its hi-tech weaponry or Hamas who launches rockets from crowded streets knowing Israel will know where the rocket came from and invites a retaliatory strike?

Israeli leaders are calling for the extermination of HAMAS.  Unless you are bucking the talking head claim that ""All Palestinians are not Hamas"", and ignoring the ""All Hamas are Palestinians"", Israel would rather not have to deal with Gaza.  It was a pain for them in 2005, it's a pain for them today, and will be a pain tomorrow and the day after.",-1
"Ah so the latter, they do want to kill Israelis the same way Israelis have killed Palestinians.",1
"Right, how many October 7th does it take to equal the total Palestinian dead? 

Or are Israeli lives worth more",1
"Alright then, *Gaza* voted for a government whose goal is to kill all the Jews and destroy Israel. Better? Israel started the indefinite blockade of Gaza precisely to prevent the smuggling of weapons by Hamas, it's not just for fun.",1
"They only “want” to wipe out Israelis just because they can’t, there’s still rockets flying to Israel. 
Israel can wipe out Palestinians easily, but they don’t.",-1
"Both sides are pieces of shit to different degrees for clarification but I have more sympathy for the Jews after learning abit of the history of that area, there's a reason why not many Jews exist outside of Israel in the middle east and the general anti semitism in the general Arab/Muslim world still lingers on heavily.  
War sucks but it wasn't Israel who started this, I am hoping the future leadership of Palestine is more open to talks with two state solutions as the previous one is clearly not working.",-1
"Rabin was no saint, he had a lot of baggage of ethnic cleansing and was responsible for the death of tens of thousands of civilians but religious Zionism wasn't his project. 

He understood, late in life, that war would never be the solution and paid with his life for it, taken by the same radicals that are now in government.

So no, I don't believe, he was Zionism personified.",-1
"If the goal of Israel was the destruction of all the palestinians, they could have done it decades ago. If Hamas had the same power, Israel wouldn't exist anymore.",-1
I believe you need to do some reading about the Zionist movement. Specifically its origins and secular history. I think you’d be surprised at how little part religion takes in its ideology.,1
"Not to continue the cycle of ""they were there first"" but Jews have existed in Israel for hundreds of years, it was literally the birthplace of Jews before Islam even was a thing.  
You can only go so far back until the claim of someones place becomes silly, from the perspective of both sides they are occupied by eachother.  
In an ideal world it would be amazing to see both Israelis and Palestinians can coexist but I personally think relgion gets in the way in both sides with Islam being more extreme towards modern rights (LGBT and women rights ect)",-1
"Jews don't want a homeland in Germany which is not their traditional home. Israel has been the homeland of the Jews for thousands of years so it makes more sense to have them go back to their homeland.   


Also even if there were no Jews in the Middle East the Arab states are perfectly capable of waging wars with each other and committing terrorism.   


The Iran Iraq war, the Syrian civil war and rise of ISIS, Yemeni Houthi war against Saudi Arabia to name a few.",-1
"Spent fifteen minutes researching the Zionist movement in the nineteenth century and you will see why this (or anywhere in Europe, really) was not a good idea.",0
"What?  Of course Israel has the power to do it, they are actually doing it, and no one doubts they will win with such an advanced military capacity and the backup from the biggest economic power humanity has seen. They wouldn't doubt nuking Gaza to the ground if america gave the green light, have you ever seen the retheoric their military leaders are using? Literally Nazi propaganda. 

But they can't afford losing their international support and in reality wouldn't solve anything.

And yes of course, if Hamas had the same power they would do it, they are terrorists, and as the power balance would be in the other extreme, all the human rights activists would be supporting Israel and sending humanitarian aid.",-1
The current conflict is proving that Israel is not up to the task. Paleatinians fight too hard and adapt too well.,1
"Hey, you can’t add nuance and reason to the moral grandstanding party. US bad, Israel bad, it’s that simple. 

The only solution those moralist will accept is because Israel wrong, they have to uproot their entire population to somewhere else.",1
"Okay, so there's a problem.  I have tried looking at the website you mentioned in the past but have not seen anything that sounds like descriptions of rape, parading in the streets, babies in ovens etc etc.  The site also has photos that have since been proven as being AI or from other conflicts.

So if we know that there are at least several false photos among them then how do we know which ones are real?  I mean the Israelis aren't exactly known for their honesty.  Plus theres a lot of evidence that they killed their own.

That takes me back to my original point.  When you decorate your argument with lies to sound more dramatic it weakens your entire argument.",1
"The way that most Westerners feel about the Sunni-Shia divide (which is to say no opinion) is similar to how most Japanese people view the Jewish and Muslim tensions. Japan has fewer preconceptions about the conflict than any other G7 nation, so there is relatively little support for Israel here. We've been told to feel sorry for Uighurs the past few years for reeducation camps. How can we feel sorry about that and not this? Japan has no compelling reason to take an official stance on this conflict.",1
"Japan's dependence to Arab oil has been particularly high in the last 2 decades.
https://www.nippon.com/en/japan-data/h00482/japan-still-reliant-on-middle-eastern-oil.html",1
"Good. Stay out of conflicts which don't involve you.
Canada could take a lesson from Japan.",0
Japan got it right.,0
"Japan needs that Saudi oil.  Half the commercials on CNNj on any given day are PR spots for Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states.  The Gulf states have a lot of power over the Japanese economy, Israel does not.",1
"I rather don't understand why the West is so supportive of Israel. That land was originally Palestinian land.  
Israel is the cause of this situation.  
I think there are many citizens in the West who distrust Israel.  
Even if you watch the news in Japan, they criticize Israel.",1
This is probably because Japan has nothing to do with Christianity or Islam.,0
"I'm seeing the official and unofficial reasons, but still kind of surprising to see Japan break from the pack on this one.",0
Good. Don't stick nose into a conflict that concerns you,0
"Eh, whatever. Both of these groups suck ass. Technically correct position I guess, through inaction.",0
"Fair, they don't have horse in this race, they're quite silent about Ukraine to begin with too.",0
"Israel is an illegal state illegally occupied and founded by Jews, and the Palestinians who were driven out and became refugees by the illegal occupation are the Palestinian Authority.  
  
The West is unconditionally defending Israel because of its guilty history of persecuting Jews, but this has nothing to do with Japan or the rest of Asia, and the current situation is nothing but the result of crimes committed by the West.  
  
The current situation is nothing but the result of the black history of the West.  
Japan's diplomacy, which provides humanitarian aid only to the actual victims, is the model for other Asian countries and is ethically and morally correct.",1
"As bad as Japan is on human rights, I'm not sure if Japan is doing this to prevent repercussions in terms of oil or if they just don't give a darn.",0
"That’s embarrassing for Japan. They can try and justify however they want, it will just come across as them being scared of doing the right thing because of pressure from their oil suppliers.",0
"This time Japan's stance really surprised me. Because Japan has always been one of the closest allies of the U.S., but this time it is unexpected that they would make an independent stance away from the U.S. and other Western nations. This is a very interesting case study, and I wonder if it has anything to do with the geographic location of Japan being in East Asia and being far removed from the conflict, or even moreso something to do with them being an East Asian nation? It's also surprising that the other G7 nations didn't exert any pressure into making Japan take a stance and respected their sovereignty.",1
"We also need a large country with a neutral position.  
If all G7 countries support Israel, China and Russia may move closer to Palestine",0
"Except it's not a Muslim and Jewish tension, but a struggle of colonized lands (Palestine and Palestinians) against colonizers (zionists).",1
Yes countries have interests. Same reason why Israel has been very quiet on Ukraine.,0
"I’m not really following current events because I have a lot of my own shit going on at the moment and I’m not really smart enough to get the subtitles of international diplomatics anyway. 

But it seems sensible not to make promises that you can’t follow through with. 

Japan would have a hard time going to war with Israel. 

I mean it’s not very likely but if Israel suddenly said “fuck you guys let’s fight” a lot of other countries are going to have a hard time justifying going to war.",0
"Japan also gets a lot of gas as LNG from Malaysia and Indonesia who support Palestine, since they are mostly Muslim too.",1
"Saudi Arabia is no ally of Hamas, so while religiously opposed to Israel it still has a vested interest in the defeat of Hamas. Hamas is an extension of the Iranian Islamic Revolution, which at its core is an anti-monarchist movement, and the Iranians have tried to interfere with the Saudi monarchy in the past. It is in Saudi Arabia's interests to contain Iran, Hamas, and other organizations like it like the Muslim Brotherhood since they pose a threat to their establishment.",0
Only qatar firmly supports palestine,1
"1. There was never a land called ""Palestine"" that belonged to the Palestinians. 
2. There was a continuous Jewish presence from 3000 BC.
3. There is no connection between Palestinian resistance to occupation, and the slaughter of women and children.",-1
"> I rather don't understand why the West is so supportive of Israel. 

Their location, and how they contrast with their neighbors.

Going back to the cold war, USSR had an influence on the Arab countries many of which had undergone the Islamic revolution and have been unstable and hostile ever since. While Isreal is the only non-arab sovereign nation in the whole region.

The US wanted to cut off the resources in Africa in the event of a war. Isreal had a force that might be able to do that, at least for a little while, was not so influenced by USSR, and is situated right at the throat of Africa.

There's different forces at play today, more specifically countries like Iran, are currently supporting radical Islam, while Isreal remains.

It's no surprise that the west continues to support Isreal in the fight against an orginization like Hamas.

It's also no surprise that Isreals treatment of Palestinians has caused tension with the west as of late.",1
Karma is currently doing a great job destroying those who engaged in genocide and war crimes against Israel two weeks ago,-1
"Hamas should have thought about karma before attacking.

Now Israel is at war path.",-1
I hope Karma doesn't take its course this time. I would hate to see Japan suffer from what supporters of terrorism deserve.,-1
They didn’t do it in support of Hamas or something.,0
The war has no connection to Japan and when both sides are murderers why pledge support? Unless you can define “murderer with less blood on hands is better” ?,0
"Do you consider modern-day Europeans ruthless killers and slave-drivers? 

People can change. WWII was truly the height of human cruelty and devastation",0
"I mean Israel is commiting numerous war crimes against palestinian civilians, would look really bad on Japanese government since people there wouldn't like that. And old people are the main voting force there.",1
"> I knew it couldn't have been for anything like principles.

why did you even entertain the idea of something different? Were talking about politics here. Literally every country and every politician is like this. If they werent they wouldnt be politicians to begin with.",
"Because if Japan has to pay even more for oil due to upsetting Saudi Arabia, then Japan will be forced to sell trillions of US T-bills to support their currency to handle the even higher fuel costs. That would be extremely bad for the US.

The US knows Japan is hanging on and getting fucked right now with currency devaluation but taking it for the team. Thats why they are not going to do anything.",1
Japan's statement on the conflict is pretty neutral imo. So it wouldn't be too inflammatory to us,0
"Very well put, while so many countries seem to not want to go to war themselves, they are doing proxy wars by sending money and guns to the countries which are boring.

Essentially just as bad as going to war, if you gave someone a gun and they use that gun to kill other people your responsible for it.

So I'm glad Japan isn't getting involved",0
"Also more importantly, none of the hostages are Japanese",1
"Not all muslim countries care that much about the fate of palestine. Lots of arabic and islamic countries have signed normalisation treaties with israel by now. Sure, the voice of the people is pro-palestine. But the governments actions are not.",-1
"we're relatively neutral, just shoving the usual ""peace above everything statement"" that we've been playing since hamas won ""election""",0
It’s the expression of support for Israel that Japan sees as being too risky for its own interests.,1
None of that is fact yet you say it like it is.,0
"They postponed that signing specifically because of the dire conditions in Gaza due to the Israeli response.  In any case, I have nothing to do with the Japanese government’s policies.",0
"Even if you look at it dispassionately, Israel's current act of retaliation is over the top.  
There is no doubt that it is a war crime.  
I don't support Hamas, but attacking innocent Palestinians and residents of Gaza is wrong.  
These people are ruthless as if they have no feelings.",1
"1. There was never a land called israel that belonged to Jews.
2. There was a continuous muslim presence
3. There is no connection between israel defending itself and bombing children and women.",1
State of Israel=/= the Jewish community,-1
"That land is Palestinian land.  
The land should be returned. Israelis should move elsewhere.",1
"Karma is the name popularized by Buddhism/Hinduism, but the concept exists otherwise. It’s a bit different here because the punishment doesn’t require reincarnation. It just comes late.",0
"Lol, genocide? You really think Hamas has the capacity to do that to Israel, one of the most armed to the teeth nations on Earth? Go drink some sewage already.",-1
"Yeah, Israel was just a few more weeks away from their ""Go ahead and call it even"" declaration! If only they had waited a little longer.",0
"Well, we will see. But I highly doubt it’s on your side. I mean, stealing someone else’s land by force, oppressing them, then killing many of them when they resist… I have some bad news for you. But I won’t ruin the surprise. 

I think deep down, maybe not even that deep, Israel knows very well that its existence is doomed sooner or later. That’s why they act in such an aggressive way. Israel needs to be maintained in order to exist. Its existence is not natural. Billions of dollars have to be spent to keep it alive.",1
"So you try to force japan to take a side? You blood thirsty demon. Japan already knows a thing or two about being pulled into war already. Not surprising they are taking a pacifist route.

You thinking japan will be punished for neutrality is the reason I’m starting to see people like you as evil.

True karma would be punishing you and your family for trying to force me to fight your own fight, like a coward.",0
"> How is it that the US, which has always had a strong influence over Japan since WWII, allows Japan to remain neutral on this matter?

They may have a strong influence but the US will respect Japan's sovereignty if they don't have a vested interest in the fight.

Specifically no Japanese citizens are being held hostage in Palestine by Hamas, and to my knowledge Japan has been rather neutral to the whole region. This is not the case for the other g7 countries.

What good would it be to drag an ally into a small proxy war that they don't want to be in? All it would do is sour relations with Japan.",0
Even more so. Japan must not let the Palestinian diplomatic channels be cut off.,1
"Speaking of China, their relationship with Israel is the purest textbook example of realpolitik ngl.",0
Israel actually relatively supportive of ukraine. their outrage was simply more delayed compared to the rest of the (mostly western) world.,0
Damn right. People need to get off their high horses and face reality!!,0
Yeah they found out the hard way what happens when they piss off their oil supplier once I don't think they'll do that again.,0
"It’s not just business interests. The West has for decades now felt responsible for the Jewish genocide. Partly because a lot of them did refuse Jewish refuges before and during WW2. To the point that they’re willing to look the other way for a lot of shit Israel did. Kind of the consequences of conflating anti Israel with anti semitism. 

The anti semitism may be frowned upon now in the West, but they were pretty prevailing before WW2. Ironically, the place that was most acceptance of Jews until then was the Muslim world.",0
"War crimes like massacring innocent civilians at a music festival, slaughtering elderly people and beheading babies, raping women and kidnapping people?  

Oh wait no, that was Palestine.",-1
As someone living in Japan with a stagnant salary it feels like many people here are nearing the edge of a financial cliff. Hope we can all make it through.,0
"They would if they could. I'm fine with eradicating a group that advocates genocide. It's just impossible to do without hurting innocents. If you have any ideas of how to eradicate Hamas without hurting the innocent people of Gaz I'd sure love to hear it.  
Oh and if I hear ""give back the land and let Jews be wiped out"" like I hear every single time I enter these discussions to the bottom of this I'll know where you stand.",-1
"The idea of ""Stolen land"" is ridiculous. No one has a right to any land they weren't born in or the sovereign of that land didn't give them. You can't just walk into a country and say ""I deserve a house!"". An Israeli born in Israel has more rights to that land than a Palestinian who was born anywhere else.   
Also, Israel has been winning every war it was part of since its inception. Arabs just don't learn. There are 20+ Arab/Muslim countries. None of which are democratic. None of which are educated. None of which are Liberal. All of which are authoritative, theocratic failed states with no human rights.   
You say Israel is not natural?!  
Gaza is kept on life support by the EU and US money. There is zero economy in Gaza. EVERYBODY in Gaza is on welfare. No factories. No tourism. No industry. No services. No technology. No academics. Nothing. And you say that ISRAEL has to be maintained by money?! People in Gaza produce nothing, have never produced anything and rely completely on foreign aid... Including from Israel! They are given free electricity, free water and free medical treatment. By Israel. And yet they are ungrateful.  
Gaza has one of the worst literacy percentages in the world, some of the worst human right violations (by Hamas), some of the less free press and one of the lowest average IQ's in the world.   


Check yourself, mate.",-1
"Individuals may care but politically theres no point getting involved at all. The whole Israel vs Palestine situation is already messy as fuck because of decades of historical shit... why make it even more complicated? That's how regional conflicts turn global, totally dumbass move to get involved

Also politicians be politicking, doesnt seem surprising to me",0
Japan themselves also did a very good job in protecting Jews in ww2 despite everything they done,-1
"That was HAMAS you ignoramus, not palestinians. Israel killed even more though. Been killing and taking their homes for the last 75 years.
Lol he blocked me cause he had 0 arguments. Average nazi supporter.",1
"Besides what other commenters mentioned, it is worth pointing out that there is still no evidence of Hamas beheading babies, and multiple news sources have retracted this statement. 

There is, however, a wealth of eyewitness videos and testimony out of Palestine of dead, orphaned, or permanently disabled children.",1
"No it's not.  Saudi Arabia can't just increase the price of oil for Japan.  There's a global market for oil, and it arrives via boat.  Japan could easily change suppliers if they needed to — a lesson Saudi Arabia specifically learned when they tried to punish geopolitical foes in the past.  The gulf states could push prices higher globally, but their ability to punish one nation is limited.",0

"Israel's actions go beyond self-defense. It is just retaliation. If we are a democratic nation, we must restrain it as a nation.  
I think more and more people in the West are also saying NO to Israel's actions. Attacking innocent people is a war crime.  
Since they killed us too, are we going to do it back? Are we going to murder innocent people? It must stop.",1
"Incorrect. Defending is taking action to stop an attack in progress, OR disarming a future or current threat. If someone points a gun at you, you don't have to wait until they fire you to shoot them first.  


Destroying Rocket launchers, ammunition bunkers and headquarter buildings of a terrorist organization that vowed to destroy you is quintessentially an act of self defense.   


As for anyone hurt in these strikes, it is a tragedy. But the blame is on whoever put them there, not on the ones defending themselves.   


A state has an obligation, and a moral right to defend its citizens, even at the expense of the citizens of a country it is at war with. Yes, even if they are seemingly innocent.   


If it was YOUR house the rockets were aimed at... you would be okay with civilians dying if it meant protecting your family.  


Also, Israel consistently takes measures to minimize civilian casualties that no other army in the world ever takes.",0

"I appreciate the effort you took by going back in my post history but maybe you should go the extra mile and check what hamas’ official goals are (spoiler alert, it’s genocide). Btw I never defended any of Israel’s actions against the Palestinian people or said I was surprised by them.",-1

"> Hamas is the democratically elected leadership of Palestine, are supported by 90% of Palestinians and have it stated in their charter that their goal is to kill every last Jew on earth. 

Hamas *was* democratically elected, but that was in 2006, before most people in Gaza today could vote and before many were even alive. And *even then*, most people who voted for Hamas disagreed with their stance on Israel:

>a [2006] exit poll from that election found that three-quarters of Palestinian voters wanted Hamas to change its stance on Israel and around 80 percent supported a peace agreement. (source below, just made more sense to address points in this order)

Support for Hamas is driven more by fear and lack of alternatives than anything else. The [actual data](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/10/dont-blame-gazans-for-hamas.html) (and that article is *rabidly* pro-Israel, so you can't argue on that point) shows that:


>60 percent supported Hamas maintaining a ceasefire with Israel, and 50 percent said Hamas should stop calling for Israel’s destruction and support a two-state solution instead.

>77 percent of Gazans want new legislative and presidential elections in the Palestinian territories, but 67 percent of all Palestinians don’t see that happening anytime soon

>In a hypothetical election, Hamas would win slightly over Fatah, 34 to 31 percent, but a 43 percent plurality of Palestinians believe neither group deserves to represent them.

There may not be shootings like in Guadalajara, where I think 4 cartels are fighting the control of the city (would be nice if there were none controlling shit, but oh well) but a lot of crimes go unreported and the police are colluded with the cartels. Either way, it's not as bad as some other big cities.

I'm not sure about Jalisco, but in general, a lot of Mexican states struggle with water. In some places, homes usually only get water every so many days and have to have water deposits. Even in my home city in the north I had a 1000 liter water deposit so I could make it without water for a few days.

By the way, I'm amazed to hear about crime being bad in Canada, I always saw it as one of the safest places to live on the continent.",0
"They're removing terrorists from power. Hamas have taken the Gaza strip hostage for the past 20 years. Israel are eradicating Hamas but Hamas are using human shields like [hospitals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLp84A6TBJ0) and will [continue to do this](https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/hamas-october-7-attack-repeat-israel-annihilated-ghazi-hamad/) if they are left untouched. It will stop when Hamas are eradicated and the Gazan people can finally be free from Hamas.

Blame those deaths entirely on Hamas.",-1
"My point is Israel wants to set up an apartheid-type ethnostate because of some 3000-year old book, when even that book shows that they weren’t the only people living there 3000 years ago. 

Re: self-defence, crack a book. Even wikipedia. You might learn something.

On the last point: I understand Israel needs to get rid of Hamas. But their strategy is born of rage not logic. The only people left behind are going to be the old, the crippled and maybe a few suicide bombers, the very definition of expendable. Nobody senior from Hamas is going to stay.",1
"You do understand you can make the exact same argument from the Palestinian point of view, right?

You know: the current living conditions in Gaza, the need to take action against an agressor who keeps people locked up in an open air prison, the past wars in Gaza etc.  I'm sure they're happy to also put the blame for Israelian casualties with the Israelian aggression.  Pre-emptive attacks, a perfect way to construct a spiral of violence.

If you know there are going to be innocent casualties and you go ahead with it anyway, it's an equally conscious  decision to kill them.  The hard facts do not lie: Palestinian living conditions, number of casualties and territory lost clearly point at Israel being the aggressor.",-1
"Every single thing you said is wrong or twisted. Every. Single. Thing. From your analogy, to your evaluation of Israel and its neighbours, and the stats on Gaza, which is a prison and not a country. It’s impossible to be this wrong unless you are emotionally invested and severely biased. That’s why I can’t help you, and why discussing with you is a waste of time.

Dismissed.",1
"'Zionism', as I understand it, is the idea that the Jewish people deserve a homeland in the area now called Israel. And I'm all for it.   
Just like I would be for it if the Japanese people wanted a homeland in the area now called Japan.   
But to be honest, it doesn't even matter. Because there IS a state called Israel, and there are people who call it their home. BTW, not only Jews, but also Muslim, Druze, Bahai, Christians and other groups. Any historic narrative is meaningless since there is an ongoing narrative of people who were born there.   


Also, anyone calling Israel an ethno-state is willfully ignorant. Jews are not an ethnic grope. There are European Jews, Arabian Jews, African Jews an Asian Jews.",-1
"Israel grants equal rights to its population of Jews, Christians, Muslim, Druze, Bahai and other religious groups. Anyone can vote and run for office. Everyone enjoys freedom of movement and freedom of religion, as well as the right not to be discriminated against for their religion, ethnicity or gender as it is stated in the Israeli declaration of independence. This is true for the Israeli Arabs, who are, for all intents and purposes, Palestinians, just under a different passport.  
  
People who are NOT Israeli citizens (e.g Palestinians, citizens of Palestine) cannot enter the country or move freely within it, without proper documents and authorization from the official ports of entry. This is what people wrongfully point to when they talk about Israel being an 'Apartheid state'. But this is also true for every other country on earth. Try walking into Japan without authorization...  
  
What you are asking for would be like if Mexico demanded Texas open its borders and grant immediate citizenship to any Mexican crossing into it, because until 1836, Texas was part of Mexico. Insane.",-1
"That's enough. No one has any obligation to any historic justice from before they were born. You don't go to prison for a crime your father committed.   


Otherwise, it time is a factor, we can just wait it out and Israel will have all the Legitimacy of Argentina or New Zealand.",-1
"I don't think Palestinians are oppressed because jews hate them.  I don't think the religion is really a factor and if roles were reversed (Palestinians got support from the west, had superior economy and military), Jews would be backed into an open air prison and bombed right now.

If i had my foot on your neck and I release, you may very well become the killer.  And if I push my foot down, I become the killer.  It's a war.  And the strongest kills and oppresses more people, takes more land.  That's Israel.

It's not a matter of which culture has justice or ethics on their side.  We're all the same brutal species in the end.  But because Israel is stronger, it is ""winning"".  It's killing more, taking more land, oppressing more people.  It has the power to enforce a (for example) 50-50 divide of the land, stop settlers of taking more and more.  But that won't happen because they're winning.  

Yes I do think Israel is generally the aggressor.  Not because they're bad people, but because of the circumstances.  That doesn't make them less aggressors tho.

Do I have a real solution.  No.  Normally this ends by the stongest pushing everybody into submission, mass migration.  Or genocide.  It's why people speak spanish in south america.",-1
"Settlements are wrong, but Israel has repeatedly given up land for peace. In 1977 with Egypt, Israel requested that Egypt take the Gaza strip. Egypt refused. Israel withdrew from most of the west bank in 1995 and from all of Gaza in 2005. Even Netanyahu signed the Wye River Memorandum in 1998, giving Palestinians land to self-govern. Israel offered to withdraw from all Palestinian territories in at least two other occasions (2000 and 2008). The Palestinians refused.  


What I see the world starting to realize is that Hamas is just like ISIS and Al-Qaeda, and that Palestinians are a terrorist-supporting culture like Iran and Afghanistan. The protests around Europe, calling to Kill Jews and not condemning the horrible things Hamas has done are beginning to wake Europe up to the inevitable clash of civilizations with the Muslim world.   


Thank god Japan does not allow massive Muslim immigration into the country.   
The world is now realizing what a horrible ideology fundamental Islam is.  


Did you know that Israel offered the Palestinians to swap lands so that settlers will remain in their houses and in exchange, Israeli Arabs (who call themselves 1948 Palestinians) and their lands will be part of Palestine?   
Do you know what happened? The Israeli Arabs refused! They prefer to live under 'Zionist' law rather than subjugate themselves to another failed Muslim dictatorship. And I bet you would choose the same.   


Not a single Arab or Muslim country is a developed country. Not a single one has a successful economy, human rights, free press or democracy. Not a single one.",-1
"I don't want to get into internal Israeli politics, but the Likud party has absolutely no real position on anything. Netanyahu is a flash of the pan and everything around him is centered towards keeping him in office.   


When you want to know what someone really believes, don't listen to what they say, look at what they actually do.   
Israel has repeatedly given up land for peace. In 1977 with Egypt, Israel requested that Egypt take the Gaza strip. Egypt refused. Israel withdrew from most of the west bank in 1995 and from all of Gaza in 2005. Even Netanyahu signed the Wye River Memorandum in 1998, giving Palestinians land to self-govern. Israel offered to withdraw from all Palestinian territories in at least two other occasions (2000 and 2008). The Palestinians refused. 

There is no reason to believe that the settlements won't be evicted as they were in Gaza (Gush Katif), Sinai and the West Bank, if a real offer for peace is proposed. The problem is that the Palestinian people do not have any leadership that speaks for them and that is interested in peace.  


Mind you that the people who called themselves 'Palestinians' only started to identify as a separate and unified people around 1967. Before that they were different tribes, indistinguishable from Jordanians or Egyptians. The 'Palestinian PEOPLE' is now in its angry teenage years and still doesn't have a cohesive cultural identity. Sociologically speaking.   


So all Israel can do at the moment is stabilize the situation until the Palestinian people mature enough as a people to have a leadership they can get behind, that actually wants to build a sustainable future alongside Israel.",0
"I'll agree with you on this. The current government of Israel is full of radical, right wing extremists that have robbed the Israeli people of the chance to discuss a long term solution to the conflict. But:  


 \- The Israeli public has been protesting for months against Netanyahu's current government, and for the past decade against his former governments. Netanyahu does not even represent half of the Israeli public, but he manages to abuse the parliamentary system that Israel inherited from the British and is unfitting for Israeli society. Something like Donald Trump losing the popular vote by 3 million votes, yet still being elected into office. Netanyahu has failed to secure a government in 4 out of the last 5 elections and has only succeeded by uniting with these extremists who are a very small minority in Israel and only because the left-leaning coalition against Netanyahu has fragmented into multiple small pieces, that did not even get a single parliamentary seat.   
Also, if you research Ben-Gvir, the most extremist of Netanyahu's government, his ticket to office had nothing to do with the Palestinians and everything to do with the rising crime in southern Israel.  
What I mean by that is that Netanyahu is a flash of the pan and leading a minority government, and his days in office are probably over. In recent poles, the Likud party is down to 19 seats from its former 32 seats. The rest of his right wing coalition has also gone down between 30-50%  according to the most recent poles.   
The protests against Netanyahu have a lot to do with the stagnation of the peace process (if you look at any images from the protests you will see peace activists and Palestinian flags), but they are mostly about corruption and judiciary reforms.   


 \-All this, and more, and it doesn't even begin to compare to Palestinians electing and supporting Hamas. Not even close. What happened on October 7th, women and children slaughtered in their homes, families burned alive, women raped, elderly people kidnapped, people shot in point blank, executed in front of their families, dogs shot, bodies mutilated... This is the kind of evil that only Islam can create on a large scale. If Israel wanted to kill Palestinians, it would have done so easily. Probably within a year. Instead the Palestinian population has tripled in size in the last 50 years! Hamas openly supports the atrocities, and the Palestinians who support Hamas know this very well. No one is trying to hide this. Don't even try to 'both sides' this.   


\- 'Colonialism' is a misused word that ignorant people use when they want to play the victim card. EVERY country is colonial. Including Palestine. And at the same time, NO COUNTRY is colonial. It's just an arbitrary code word for left leaning anti-western ideas.",1

"Nah, as an Asian, most of us still harbors hate since we have families that were casualties of the Japanese's Brutality. We have clans that literally sliced off our family because of them. My grandma said that her younger sister, baby, literally got speared in the head and is paraded in the street as the Japanese wait for another baby to his pile.  

What's worse is that the Japanese have yet to admit their wrongdoings and refuse to admit the brutality that occurred. 

But that doesn't mean we're not gonna help them. That doesn't also mean that when we help them, we forgive them.",0

"I am German and I think it would be totally fine giving them a part of Germany or Austria, but ..... No Jew would like to build a state there understandable. Palestine never ever 'owned' the land which Israel 'took' from them. Both have rights to the land from 1000s of years ago. I just say, Palestine got a fair chance to build it's own state, beside Israel. They would have to make compromises, of course, but would have their own state for the first time in history. The blew it and now blame Israel for it. We both don't know, if it would have worked, but it was a chance. But they chose to attack Israel and were surprised when they got kicked their arses by the young state. Didn't expect that, they thought they could kill the Jews and take the whole territory.",-1
