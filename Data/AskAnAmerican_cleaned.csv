"jewish people do nt claim be jewish just as a religion   its also ethnicity if you ask I what my family be I would say I m jewish just like someone would say I m irish or italian my family immigrate escape from russia and poland but I m neither of those ancestry 

 as such   american jews tend to have strong tie to israel simply because they too be jewish there s exchange program between the country look up birthright israel and also the maccabi game 

 from young age be teach about the holocaust and what it mean to be kill simply because relative be jewish   generational trauma 

 this all before even get to the religious aspect"
"a few thing and for the record I be an athi 

 1 hama and hezbollah be both consider terrorist group or supportive of terrorist group by many americans who be neither muslim nor jewish 
 2 israel do tick a lot of the same red flag that aparthie south africa do for moderate and liberal americans and non religious conservativesye these exist 
 3 hamas behavior over the last 10 day have basically make they impossible to support 
 4 in a calm mood most americans would freely admit that palestine have legitimate grevence and israel have operate in bad faith 
 5 american citizen be be hold hostage by hamas at this moment and until they be return unharmed no tolerance of hamas can be consider"
well ill say this post be probably make in more good faith than the other one from early today
jerusalem and by extension the entire area have be fight over for about 1200 year by three major religion judaism islam and catholicism anyone part of directly or indirectly those religion may feel some sort of connection to the conflict on that basis
"well as a jew our faith be inherently tie to the land our prayer always refer to go back to jerusalem and be tie to the land all notwithstanding talk to any jewish person and you be very very hard press to find any of we who do nt have some family member or friend over there give how small and close knit a community we be and how central the land be to our faith all notwithstanding that a portion of the population there have always be in israel since preislamic time while most jews be diaspora jews mizrahi be in israel and the place have always have some jewish presence 

 that s just the explanation I can give for our side of this not even touch the bit about the palestinians and insofar as that s concerned fact be there be christian palestinians though they be not represent by hamas same with lebanon which israel have fight as well these ethnic group actually have substantive christian segment"
"I m jewish and I do have family there a lot of we do its not just a religious thing although that also part of it jews be an ethnoreligous group even if be most recent non american ancestor be from elsewhere I do think a lot of we feel attachment to it many people learn hebrew or try to learn and then give it up 

 israel be found after the holocaust during which very few country be willing to take jewish refugeesonly dominican republic agree to increase number of jewish immigrant they be take edit and even go far back to the early 10th century pogrom in the russian empire and before that the logic behind zionism and the creation of israel 

 many people view it as a safe haven if you need to flee even if it seem unlikely for that to happen in america"
its not just land its basically god hometown and everyone want to give it back to he
well the land claim be make due to historical religious context in addition to simple occupation
"I mean ethno religious group organize for cause abroad in the united states be old   benito juarez organize his government in exile when france take over mexico on the usa border but his wife and family live in new york and dc meet president lincoln  

 an irish para militia try to invade canada to liberate it from the crown 

 japanese anarchist attempt to assasinate emperor meji

 look at the anticastro sentiment in miami or antimaduro sentiment among venezuelan

I ai nt touch this with an 11 foot pole
"let just say the first amendment 

 freedom of religion freedom of speech and freedom of the press 

 plus some people like this country because its the land of opportunity and they can start a business here too"
"no its not about land   hamas openly say they want all jews dead   they campaign on jewish genocide   16 year ago   if this comment get delete by a mod   then I have lose all 
 faith in this site   every time I state a simple truth on this subject I get ban from that room   fact be fact   wether we like they or not"
"why be it that we muslimjewish citizen who be not palestinian or israeli nor have family there feel a personal connection about this 

 as I understand it some of the holy site in the abrahamic religion be in israel or palestine and we all know how that go"
"since every american who do nt descend from native americans indians be an immigrant from somewhere else many of we feel a connection to our history just as those who have stay in their homeland 

 it can be difficult for those who be nt from a country make almost entirely of immigrant to understand this 

 there s quite often an attitude of contempt or hostility towards an american who s a quarter irish for claim heritage what s happen with the american in these instance be an attempt to understand where their grandfather come from and establish a bond with their ancestor 

 be a nation of people from somewhere else"
"I m in the solid camp that its not my circus not my monkey   


 that be say I wholly support the retaliation of israel against hamas regardless of the legitimacy of grievance from both side hamas lose any sliver of mercy I have in my heart after they place launch site in school and hospital back in 20145 and exactly 0 of their effort since then have do anything to reverse that feel"
"the us do nt expect or demand that immigrant abandon an emotional connection to their ancestral homeland nor to their coreligionist in other country 

 jews have a century old love for the land of israel from which most be expel by the roman"
as an american taxpayer I do nt want to fund ethnic cleansing
this be about land a holy land of which both of they believe be their holy land jews muslim and christians all believe israel be a holy place and all of they have have or still currently have some form of religious beef over who control it there s certainly a political aspect to it there be many secular palestinians and israelis who oppose the other for nonreligious reason but the main reason behind the conflict be still religious in nature
speak on my father side he s muslim its because he do nt approve of the ethnic cleansinggenocide go on he view it like this as a bosnian muslim who witness the bosnian war and the ethnic cleansing of the bosian muslims first hand back in the 90
a lot of people in a narcissistic way feel they need to do something to show how good they be I feel that s about all I can say without offend literally everyone but this be the primary population of people attend a rallyprot for either side
its way too long of a history lesson to unpack in one reddit post   and you ll find too many opinion that may or may not be right    this be something that you should take some time to google for yourself    its important to do your own research and come to your own conclusion on this so you be not clouded or confuse by what random stranger on the internet think
most of my friend who be jewish have a love one or a close friend right now in israel I be tell that outside the us israel have the most amount of people who also have a us passport
my heart be heavy for all the innocent on both side
I m very ignorant on the issue but I think its consider the holy land or something its not just a land dispute between two country so it make sense why some jews and muslims outside the region might still have strong opinion on the subject
"american citizen be be hold hostage by hamas at this moment and until they be return unharmed no tolerance of hamas can be consider 

 all else be true but this be the point that I get stuck on I do nt think there be any return to tolerance for hamas even if the hostage be return unharmed"
oh god what do that one say
its be way long than 1200 year king david conquer the city and declare jeruslemum the jewish capital 1000 bce needless to say its be know to have conflict for a long time and everyone have their own dog in the fight
"and catholicism 

 somewhere in the world right now there be a greek orthodox christian who be pray that someday people will discover that they exist"
"but three different group of people all want their own version of god hometown we have get 

 jews   they want to build the third temple and bring in the messiah 

 evangelical protestant in the us   they want jews to migrate to israel so the rapture can happen and they ll go to heaven 

 muslim   they want to keep their mosque in god hometown which be incidentally build in the same place jews would like to put the temple"
I wonder if there s any connection to god hometown be on one of the most fertile piece of   land in a region where the major trade route link three continent intersect
what be jerusalem worth
hamas have like 50 or so support from palestinians they willingly elect a political party whose entire existence be to kill jews they be literally hitler wet dream just imagine what the rest of the world would think of we if half of our population support the kkk
"many jewish americans be pretty connected to israel most of my jewish friend and my partner have friend and family there and at least one of my close friend have family both murder and kidnap 

 it also hit very close to home for jewish people to see other murder simply for be jewish"
disagree ado have be here for century and unfortunately most of we do nt feel any connection to africa at all we be thoroughly american
hmm be nt the majority already live outside the land by that time the diaspora
what do you want israel to do israel be nt gather up civilian and murder they
okay well would you say the genocide be occur because palestinians be muslim or because they be not jewish
what baffle I be people care so much about something they know so little about question like op be search for the logic or reason behind which side someone support but most people be incredibly ignorant about the geopolitic of the middle east and most likely support the side they do due to their social circle
I have do research I be actively do research my question be to ask muslim and jewish united states citizen their personal connection to this situation therefore yes I want people opinion so let just say I m create something for the next person to research
why do you support palestine when you be gay if hamas want you dead essentially
focus more on the religious conflict arise from the birth of christianity
delete
um as a catholic I have be tell my entire life that we be the world old christian religion be there debate on that
wow this help sm
and the funny thing be that all three of they be do the same thing wait for an elijah character
from what I understand which be still limit it be specifically zionist jews that want that not all jewish people
catholic in the us be also teach the land belong to the jews although we differ on the rapture and al aqsa be build on the temple of david just like the turk build a mosque on the hagia sofiaworld old catholic church unfortunately because islam spring from christianity we have many holy site in common they love to build mosque on top of the everything
if you be god and you want to eventually establish a worldwide religion a region where the major trade route link three continent intersect would be a good place to start
now that s just crazy talk
you speak for all of they
"they very much be now they have tell they to leave one part of gaza and go to the southern part of gaza all while bomb the south the israelis be target school and medical facility that be usually use as safe haven and everyone know that historically once palestinians leave their home they never ever get they back so by say that if they stay in their home they be likely to be kill the israelis be round up civilian and kill they because now these people have a choice either they leave their home and everything they own or they die do you know what you would choose because I do nt and collective punishment be a war crime 

 my partner be jewish we know and love people in israel I be and be very upset by hamass attack on innocent people I want israel to have a reasonable reaction to it this be not reasonable this be not just but almost nothing the israeli government do be 

 edit I want to add that there be we citizen in gaza that be in serious danger that can not leave"
"as if that s the only way to kill people I want israel to respect palestine right to their land and if they ca nt do that they need to respect their right to live israel be the powerhouse in this battle I think we need to wary of any news that suggest otherwise we have see over the last week or two how western medium have extreme bias in their coverage as israelis be kill vs palestinians have die language example of how israel can commit ethnic cleansing without round up civilian and murder they 

 israel bulldoze palestinian home 

 israel cut off essential resource 

 israel blockade gaza 

 the fact that anyone who defend palestine be label as an antisemite be a huge red flag to I as this open the door for crime to go uncriticized or unnoticed 

 I remain open to new information as I think we all should all that I have see make the full scale invasion of gaza look like an act of genocide rather than an act of war"
"if you be to ask I i d say its more unfortunate apathy towards muslim especially in the west during a post 911 era neoorientalism especially with the threat of the other there s definitely be a resurgance in that way of think with this event just as we have see another surge in antisemitic rhetoric handinhand 

 but in the case of israel I ca nt comment on why this be be be carry out I have my own theory but all I can comment on be what I see base on past historical context both in this situation and in other similar to it I just ca nt claim to be an expert on it 

 edit click enter too early oop"
that be a valid question
1000 year of muslim rule will do that
"catholic say that they be the old church and that the orthodox split off from they in 1054 orthodox say that they be the old church and that catholic split off from they in 1054 

 either way well before then the church have kind of split into the greek speak and the latin speak rite they be still in communion with each other until 1054 but their liturgy and custom be diverge after the great schism the majority of western latin speak congregation join the roman catholic church usually just call catholic and the majority of eastern greek speak congregation join the orthodox catholic church usually call eastern orthodox 

 the greek church bear the brunt of the early muslim conquest while the church be still unify then after the split there be pretty frequent conflict between the orthodox and muslim with catholic join in every time there be a crusade"
"we be but the orthodox be in a sense depend on how you define it orthodox view we as split off the original church while we view they 

 protestant however come way later with most of their church found in the 1500 or even more recently"
it would also be a good choice for overlord and conman
what s a reasonable reaction
"my point be israel be in a lose lose situation here no matter what they do people be go to give they way more shit 

 again I propose the question what do you want israel to do because the response should nt be nothing I do nt see what response you d want they to have that you would nt call shitty its war its go to be shit no matter what 

 but I m personally not go to defend the side explicitly kill civilian 

 I think the fact that other arab nation be nt willing to take the refugee make it pretty clear that this be nt the cut and dry thing you want it to be"
as a gay man I do nt think it be
honestly I have no idea what a reasonable action would be but I ca nt just shrug and say welp suck to be they but it be what it be
ok you can support some one who would kill you for gay if you want
wait wait wait   you just say that you do nt think hamas   would want you dead because you be gay   be that seriously what you just say   oh dear child    son please educate yourself on the subject and I do nt mean by ask your college friend   and whatever you do do not approach a member of hamas and tell they you be gay   lol
it really be like that the most any of we can do
how do we make the leap from the palestinian people to the organization of hamas
where do I say I do nt think hamas would want I dead for be gay please show I where I say that
hamas have like 50 support from palestinians
you really think that s a big leap   its the same as if   say for example an army of 200000 american   democrats attack and kill a thousand   idk   let say orange people   people from other country would say americans attack and kill the orange people   they would nt be like   democrats from california kill the orange people   lol get it
they be the same thing
"sweet jesus child   scroll up 
  you just say it to another poster    I this same thread   lol somebody ask you what the other post be about   you say it be about   why do you support hama if your gay and they want you dead   the other poster say that be a valid question and you say   and I quote   as a gay man I do nt think it be    if you mean something other than what   your comment   say   than you be the only one that understand what you mean   the other poster say   ok fine if you want to support a group that want you dead     I take get the same thing from your comment as he do   that you support hamas and do nt think they would want you dead for be gay"
"of a group of people where 40 be under the age of 14 

 hama have also violently suppress opposition to they in the 16 year they violently take control"
"I do nt get your comment 

 I have yet to see any news coverage of the current situation that have nt specify this atrocity be commit by hamas if radical democrats do do such a thing I 100 believe coverage of this would say radical democrats from california kill orange people and not californian kill orange people 

 I mean in the us when we talk about white supreme do something we do nt cover it as simply white people and none of we think its indicative of all white people"
no they be not how be they
yes I say I do nt think it be as in I do nt think its a valid question
"they willingly elect hamas in 2006 an organization that s entire existence be to kill jews 

 the adult in palestine be largely responsible for this as well"
hamas be a government branch of a palestine territory   hama be   palestinians   where be the stretch you speak of
the palestinian crowd cheer the murder of innocent israeli civilian grandmother and child at the big pro palestine protest in the west they cheer the death of israeli civilian proclaim gas the jews
they support hamas so they be part of it
you do nt think   a valid question be   why do you support hamas if they would want you dead   its a very valid question
"I m honestly confused about what point your try to make 

 obviously hamas be make up of palestinians since they be an organization in palestine I do nt understand how understand that palestinians have be fuck over for 70 something year be cosign the action of hamas two thing can be true at the same time"
"question what be your thought on this 



 I also do nt see what protest in the west and any antisemitism that occur there have to do with the situation in israel and palestine"
"1 I m curious how you come to that conclusion 

 2 I guess by this logic I should nt care or support the people of utah and fuck all should happen to they since they support a government and have people in power who be nt exactly lgbtq friendly"
"you do nt think   a valid question be   why do you support hamas if they would want you dead 

 you rephrase the original question I never say anything about support hama"
your get a lot of wrong information   if I be tech savvy i d send you some link to educate you on this   I m a lot old than you   my grandfather fight in ww2 to put an end to the holocaust and his brother die in the war to do the same   I know thing you do nt kiddo
"oh so its trust I bro and you be not tech savvy enough to copy and paste and link 

 both my grandfather fight in ww2 as well so idk what kind of flex that be or how that give you inside knowledge"
do you talk to your grandfather about it in depth   I do   be your entire family effect because your family member die in the battle of the bulge   fight the nazi    no you do nt   because you would t have make the idiotic comment that hamas would not kill you for be gay   kid that tell I everything I need to know there about how uneducated you be on the subject
"do you talk to your grandfather about it in depth   I do   be your entire family effect because your family member die in the battle of the bulge   fight the nazi   

 I honestly do nt understand the point of this 

 no you did nt   because you would t have make the idiotic comment that hamas would not kill you for be gay   kid that tell I everything I need to know there about how uneducated you be on the subject 

 again please show I where I say hamas would not kill I for be gay"
I just send it to you   unless you mean something entirely different   but to I and the other poster   we take the same thing from what you say
I do nt think you and the other poster interpret my response the same tbh
ok let try this   answer my question with yes or no   do you support hama   do you think that hamas would not wish you ill for be a gay man
no I do nt support hama I never say anything about support hama I never make any allusion to support hamas I never once make any statement about support hamas in any literal or hypothetical sense
well I sure wish you have say that soon   cause none of this conversation would have happen   lol
I did nt think I have to since as I already state nothing I say even allude to be in support of the organization
"you be the only one that know that s what you be say   uuuhhhggggg   you know I always say that social medium be the cancer that destroy   civilization and I have no social medium   no fb   no instagram   no nothing   I get on this app cause I m recover from break my neck   and I ca nt move around much   so what happen   I get on social medium and get in an argument with a stranger   that be nt even an actual argument because everything get lose in social 
 medium translation   I ca nt wait till I heal and go back to work   lol   have a good night and I sincerely apologize for the misunderstanding"
I honestly do nt accept your apology because you try to quote I as say thing I do not say and be very condescend throughout this exchange I m still understand why you start talk about grandfather and ww2 and try to see which one of ours be more affected by it as if it be a competition
"it be not a competition with our grandfather   if yours serve as well than they be every bit the hero mine be for do what they do    when I think you be say you did nt think hamas would wish you harm    I say there be no way you have speak at length with anyone about the war and when you speak of steal land   I know I be right about that   you do realize isreal did nt steal land   that they be bear there   jesus be a jew   and the british divide the land at the end of the war   the land the jews be chase out of   the 
 palestian be not happy with the division of land   even though they be give the more fertile land   the jews take their desert land and turn it into gold with their knowledge of aquaduct they even learn how to grow orchard of fruit with saltwater   they turn a desert into profit and the palestine take their land and pout about   the jews get any land and focus on death and destruction   everybody have it in for jews   they be constantly fight to just live    imagine be surround by people that openly tell you everyday they want you dead   and you seem to refuse to look at what you say from other people view   I m not the only one that misunderstood your standpoint    I give my apology you did nt accept it   so be it   god bless and let hope for bright day for all the innocent on both side   across the world"
ps I did nt quote you as say something different than you say   I quote it word for word   it be your meaning that be different from what you say
"I do nt deny jesus be a jew that jews have a cultural tie to that area and I admit that jews have always be present there even before the creation of isreal 

 but I m curious especially as an american to know if you if your support also extend to other group of people who have cultural and historic claim to an area and I d you feel they too have a right to the land"
"

 you quote I word for word with this statement I never once utilize none of my comment have be edit and all of my comment be still up maybe you do nt know the meaning of word for word"
that be nt what you say   that be what the other poster say   that be the question of the other poster paraphrase   I believe he say group instead of hamas when I quote you it be word for word   you be all confused   I think we can end this conversation now   there be no point to it any long

"where I live the armenian genocide and diaspora be a serious topic with frequent demonstration 

 I have spend a lot of time talk about brexit and the state of the uk 

 I think people both wellinforme and misinformed spend a lot of time talk about central america"
"what to do about china get people pretty rile up 

 also we have long have a lot of simmer conflict with mexico relate to immigration which more recently have extend through central america and now definitely include venezuela and a couple other south american country 

 frankly anything to do with the middle east get heat our relationship with saudi arabia our conflict with iran etc"
one heated issue I know of be whether we should maintain our embargo on cuba
"what to do about russia in ukraine be get pretty heated between those who want to help ukraine and those who worry about either the expense or worry it may trigger world war iii 

 china be always a hot button item be it what s happen in taiwan or in tibet 

 beyond that I do nt know anything that be particularly heatedbeyond the usual political nonsense of disagree with the other party because the other party be wrongregardless of what the other party be do I mean the republicans could say the sky be blue and it d create heat debate over how it can be brown or green or dark and how antiscience be these asshat anyways and do you want people to die in tornado because they do nt know what sky color to look for"
I m not sure if there be any real example outside of whatever be in the news cycle at the time that the different party have take oppose side on
right now ukraine and russia specifically the money go to fund ukraine which be ridiculous we make security assurance to they in the budapest memorandum and the fact that a large majority of people do nt care about that be concern
the war in iraq still play a crucial role in a lot of people political opinion especially those of we who be old enough to remember the leadup to the war zoomer and gen a probably do nt fully appreciate just how deeply divisive it be and how many of those scar remain especially when debate foreign policy and america large role in the world
"what to do about iran because our stance on iran shift depend on whose president and from what party 

 and the iranian government of course take advantage of this run lobby and russiastyle disinformation campaign"
immigration include those who advocate for open border against those who advocate for control immigration with screening and verification that those who come in contribute to society through language skill and abide by law
"I grow up in an area with a majority asian population east asian and south asian with a minority of white people and very few other minority black hispanic muslim etc 

 racial issue can get very interesting imo national discourse tend to be frame as black vs white or occasionally hispanic vs white and often no one in the room identify with either of those race"
"ukraine china iran and mexico and that s about it 

 I m not go to take position on any of these but you get a lot of discussion over whether or not we should support ukraine what to do about china with which we have a number of serious problem iran because of a fairly ugly history with that country and mexico because of immigration and drug 

 discussion of china and mexico involve what to do about problem that most reasonable people agree exist discussion about ukraine the middle east in general and iran in particular tend to be ugly and be frequently conduct in bad faith we have to deal with mexico because its right next door and problem there really ca nt be deny or avoid ukraine tend to be an uglier topic because people disagree about whether or not we should even be involve there"
the poomeister winnie the pooh whatever cuba and venezuela be up to iran iraq afghanistan france if they be in ha mood maybe germany if they be do eushenanigan oh and that fat kid who love rocket
"mexico border china israel russiaukraine cuba saudi arabia in that order give or take 

 edit iran and north korea too but those people tend to forget out unless they do something to make the news"
immigration through our southern neighbor can get pretty heated
uh all of they lol
putin sympathizer be not look at kindly where I live its particularly hot because a local of ours go over to volunteer to help
"israelpalestine tend to be more unifying than most other foreign policy issue actually   the heat be come from a vocal minority 

 the hot topic that actually divide people into two real camp generally revolve around immigration and trade how free it should be and with whom   actual intervention as oppose to various kind of aid will also generate some heated discussion but all the actual ustroopsfightinginanothercountry stuff the we be involve in at the moment be relateively lowkey and fly under the radar   i d say most people be not aware we have troop in niger for example   most have probably forget we still have people in syria for that matter   and in ukraine as well   the perception be that they be nt really fight   I doubt that s completely accurate in any of those case 

 aid tend to be at the discretion of whoever be in charge at the moment and while there be difference of opinion it do nt get as much traction as the dissenter from the president policy would like 

 outside of those   the iran nuclear deal or no deal be probably the most heated debate go at the moment and its just gotten put on the very back burner with the recent excitement in the levant"
"immigration be one of the most heated frustrating and just kinda dumb political debate we have 

 its easy to forget 10000 bat crap crazy donald trump story later but be harsh on immigration and build a border wall be basically trump only concrete policy when he start his 2016 campaign 

 its a really frustrating debate because so many people get the basic fact and term wrong 

 some basic fact people miss people be legally allow to cross the border to seek asylum only an estimate 50 of illegal immigrant cross the border illegally its just as common to overstay a legal visa as cross illegally illegal immigrant commit few crime than nativeborn americans illegal immigrant pay taxis and do nt get benefit which have make they pretty much indispensable to the way the economy of california and texas currently operate 

 I also just think its weird that oppose immigration seem to motivate voter nationally the majority of illegal immigrant go to just 4 state so I m not sure why anybody in wisconsin ohio west viriginia or colorado would care 

 lastly its just frustrating that nobody seem to have any interest in reform the republican agenda just seem to be make the experience of be an immigrant shittier and the democratic agenda seem to be kick the can down the road 

 the whole thing just piss I off"
  americans usually do nt pay attention to foreign country problem when it do nt involve usmost people simply do nt have time to worry about foreign problem when we have problem of our own   the ukraine russia conflict and other type of foreign aidhumanitarian aid or weapon supply   cause problem because many americans believe we should be spend our money on our own people instead of foreigner
any country that directly oppose or threaten american ideal I m not to say who s in the right but the dystopian society in place like china and north korea be real scary
"cuba 

 the cartel in latin america 

 weirdly I see people get catch up in canadian politic sometimes it ll be oddly specific stuff like change with the canadian nursing union"
"truly do nt even know where to start but its surprisingly regional for anything specific 

 I really be just once again amazed by how region specific everything in this country be as far as our cultural difference go I do nt remember the last time I see a question on here that could nt be at least partially explain by it depend on the specific area of the country"
most of they
immigration
my father be from taiwan and explain which country he be bear in occasionally get interesting
do israelpalestine get heat in the us grant I have nt live in america in 6 year now but I never actually see propalestine anything until I move to europe and I m from michigan so I m actually from a state with a sizable muslim population
people who be nt jewisharab do nt know what the fuck they be talk about when it come to israelpalestine anyhow I m sick of pussyfoot around it they just do nt until a week ago most people did nt understand that hamas be a terrorist group all of they should stop pretend they actually know what go on there
now this be interesting because its both international and hyperlocal around I I keep run into people who did nt know what the armenia genocide even be
I guess it also help that a major local band system of a down have be an outspoken advocate of discussion and recognition of the genocide they even perform in armenia itself on the 100th anniversary
"I have spend a lot of time talk about brexit and the state of the uk 

 how much coverage do brexit receive in the us 

 a lot of americans I have meet fall into the trap of thinking of boris johnson as the british trump they share some superficial similarity but brexit be too big to be define by one man alone"
how many people still feel that strong about cuba though its basically just cuban americans these day
"the fact that a large majority of people do nt care about that be concern 

 I blame our culture of insularity"
"and then the third camp who want to block all immigration and eject those already grant stay here 

 just want to make sure you do nt forget they"
lol this be write like political pollster frame question to get the answer they want
I do nt think anybody advocate for open border and I do nt see why speak english and have skill would be necessary condition to contribute to society
most racism I have see on social medium be between south asians and middle easterner also muslim vs hindus
muskrat he s not exactly fatit more like he s invent a new much bad body type
"I respect much of what you say but I think you be misconstrue some point that the anti immigration crowd make 

 people be legally allow to cross the border to seek asylum 

 yesbut the issue be that there be a large cohort of immigrant abuse asylum claim when they be come for economic reason which be not what asylum be design for I absolutely empathize with people who want a well life and well wage but want to make more money or be poor in and of itself be not a qualifier for asylum and it become a problem when you have so many people make those claim that the system be bogge down and ca nt adjudicate who be a valid asylum seeker and who be nt in an efficient manner which hurt people who actually qualify more than anything 

 illegal immigrant pay taxis 

 in some case yes for asylum seeker since many ca nt seek employment legally they be nt pay taxis though and give the budget city like nyc dc and chicago be spend on migrant I find it difficult to believe its as positive as you make it sound and its also worth note that the demographic of illegal immigrant have change   it use to be mostly work aged mexican man who come up to find a job and send money to their family home it be now predominantly venezuelan cuban and central american family come and that change the picture when you be enrol 3 kid in public school and chip etc that have a pretty large effect on the net taxis you pay to the system finally on this note pay taxis do nt absolve you of crime or infraction I have get speed ticket and red light camera ticket before be I suddenly not allow to face the consequence because I pay taxis that s just not how that work 

 most only go to 4 state 

 most actor and writer only live in 4 state too probably 80 be in california   ny tbh be I not allow to care about the strike most violent crime happen in a handful of city and red state be I not allow to have an opinion on gun control I do not buy the argument that because there be nt as many immigrant in wisconsin or west virginia that those folk be nt allow to have opinion on it its their country too"
"  lastly its just frustrating that nobody seem to have any interest in reform the republican agenda just seem to be make the experience of be an immigrant shittier and the democratic agenda seem to be kick the can down the road 

 I feel this happen with almost all political issue see student debt but I fully agree 

 its frustrating to see the whole spectrum of nuance solution in between get compress to a binary of either we should accept anyone with open arm and deport anyone with melanin"
"people be legally allow to cross the border to seek asylum 

 this be a common misconception asylumseeker be suppose to cross at a legal point of entry cross the border illegally do nt invalidate a potential asylum claim but it be still illegal 

 only an estimate 50 of illegal immigrant cross the border illegally 

 the disproportionate focus on illegal crossing be because people with expire visa be at least vet somewhat 

 illegal immigrant commit few crime than nativeborn americans 

 most crime be withingroup and thus most crime commit by illegal immigrant be against other illegal immigrant who be often afraid to report crime for fear of be deport although in reality they would not normally be deport for report a crime even outside sanctuary jurisdiction"
there be several protest and counterprotest across the state harvard student be doxe after write an antiisrael letter a palestinian child be attack in a hate crime some have lose their job

I have meet americans who fall into the trap of thinking of trump as the sole reason the modern conservative party be like that when really the madness be too big to be define by one man attribute large sweeping political movement to one guy be pretty common
yes but cuban americans be politically valuable
ill have to research any politician that have publicly state they will block all immigration and eject those grant stay here because that be an extreme position that will never win any seat
"there s absolutely activist circle that advocate for that 
 and generally I think most country want immigrant to be part of society include be able to communicate and participate in it rather than stay in isolate enclave"
I think he s talk about north korea
"all good point I want to support your post because you be absolutely right that I focus more on misconception that favor my preferred solution 

 my response to the idea of bogus asylum claim be that that would be a place for legal reform not physical barrier a wall do nt differentiate between who do and do nt have a legitimate claim 

 good point on the benefit kid absolutely do get to go to public school and get food assistance I personally teach hundred of they I can confirm that 

 on the idea of face consequence I think it really depend on how we frame it we can frame it as you do a crime you should face consequence but I would appreciate a more realistic framing of you have every incentive in the world to do this so what be we go to do about it because they be come no matter what 

 as for the last one that s one of my more controversial opinion but yes I do think you need a minimum amount of knowledge and skin in the game to have an opinion with immigration specifically I feel like the discourse have be poison by people who do nt know thing about the immigration system and do nt know any immigrant themselves who fall for obvious lie"
but they do pay taxis sale tax

honestly not anymore they all live in florida and florida be rapidly become if it have nt already become one a republican hellhole
it seem to I there be some nutball politician here in arizona who want to ban all imigration
"eject those grant stay refer to the old dacadreamer fight which do have plenty of opponent call for their deportation 

 for block immigration you just need to look at trump and his sycophant"
genuinely curious if you can name some specific example of activist circle that explicitly advocate for open border
"it may be armenian diaspora food but the food my armenianrussian now american friend would provide when host or his mom would cook for we be always delicious 

 the one thing that always stand out to I be khatchapuri"
florida be do fine from what I have see and hear I guess it depend to what politic you prescribe too but in reality florida economy be do great and republicans seem to keep on gain ground in that state I do nt like california but if the people seem to keep vote democratic in that state obviously there be thing that be work for that state that might not work for other
