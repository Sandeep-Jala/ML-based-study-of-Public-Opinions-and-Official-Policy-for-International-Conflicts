"Again, I support the establishment of a Palestinian state in Quebec, for the lols"
"I understand Hamas is a terrorist and not even entertaining any conspiracy theories, we’re allowing for the killing of a lot of civilian population by a sophisticated army in response to the action of a terrorist. 

So if the protests are in support of Hamas then it’s shameful and must be condemned. 

However, i do support a march to stop the massacre happening in Palestine. As a non-aligned person, it’s no different from a Russia vs Ukraine. Innocent lives are being destroyed because of some mad man, some greed, some politics but is one is supported and is not. 

It’s sad to see us humans so educated and instead of fighting bigger challenges like population, climate change, disease control are busy fighting and killing each other.

Edit: corrected condoned with condemned."
"As an impartial observer, I can't see the forest because of the trees.  Politically and morally both sides are inexcusable.  Your hate will consume you both."
I thought the freedom convoy was bad but these protests are a flipping embarrassment to this country. Go tf home.
These protestors should also be mad at Hamas
"The lack of empathy on Canadian posts on Reddit lately disgusts me. Palestinians are people too, and they have a right to raise awareness of what’s happening to them. I can’t believe how many Canadians so callously support apartheid."
"Their protests are fine, but I don't think it'll actually do much to remedy the situation in the Middle-East."
"They should protest against Hamas. Hamas is responsible for the death of Palestinians. It was part of their plan to get Israel to respond militarily.

They should also let go of Free Palestine and sue for peace because the Jews have a legitimate claim to the region and are not going away."

I call on all sides to pursue peace
So easy for people to protest from their safe peaceful stable democracies.  I wonder how they would feel if their neighbours were committed to trying to kill you.  I don’t think Canadians living here can appreciate how radically different life is in the Middle East. They should probably protest over there for maximum effect
"Good. People are ignorant and just want to label all Palestinians as Hamas, when in reality they're exercising their right to protest against the slaughter of innocent Palestinians by Israels retaliation"
"Ah, diversity and cultural enrichment."
"Netanyahu has done more to stoke anti semitism than hamas ever could (also because he encouraged funding for them as recently as 2019)

That's anti-semetic holocaust revisionist Netanyahu for you"
This is being used to distract you from real issues in Canada.
Pro Hamas demonstration has been popping up across Canada. With Hamas labeled as an international terrorist threat why isn't anything done about the individuals and organizations who condone Hamas' actions?
Stop making to be a war against hamas. It's a war against Palestinians and always has been.
Free palestine.
"Pro-terror, CBC. Its a pro-terror rally."
"It seems many struggle to understand the distinction between Palestinians who by and large simply want t a place to live in peace and safety, and terrorist groups like Hamas. Over two million Palestinians are trapped in Gaza, dying as the IDF and Hamas fight amongst them. Over three hundred thousand Palestinians are newly homeless. Over one million are displaced. Thousands are in hospitals waiting to die as water and power run out. Demonstrating in support of a people who have been as battered and abused as the Palestinians have been is understandable, and shouldn’t be confused with supporting terrorism. There are many Palestinians and Israelis working together to bring peace to the region."
"Everybody should be marching to stop the war crimes that Israel is committing in Gaza right now. They are indiscriminately bombing bystanders and civilians. This amounts to collective punishment. Withholding water, power, and food is also going to cause massive civilians deaths. Already Israel, by there OWN count, have killed more civilians than Hammas did in their attack. Asking a million civilians to move overnight is ethnic cleansing.  It is rehensible the bloodlust and repression of the rights of Palestinians that we’re seeing on this subreddit. 

These marches are NOT pro Hammas. They are pro-Palestine, they are asking for the world to step in and stop the bloodshed and stop the murder of civilians by the Israeli government."
"It’s real interesting now. 
Hamas group and leaders don’t live in hell hole Gaza. They live like kings in Qatar and Iran and UAE.
How will ground assault of Gaza get rid of Hamas? 

People with critical thinking skills should ask themselves this, instead of blindly supporting Israel, when they have already broken international laws."
Did they do any anti semitic shit at this one too?
Losers.
Send em all home.
"Canada, you are fucked."
ALL of these people should be arrested.

Why do they bring kids to political manifestation. Cowardice.
"I feel bad for everyone in this horrible never-ending Israel/Palestine conflict. It is easy to see lots of victims and lots of monsters. 

I also feel bad for Canada as so many people are upset with others charter right to express their speech and then go home after.

You can be upset with their message, but you cannot be upset with the fact we have people take to the streets to express a political opinion and then after the march they get out of the street so life can resume."
"Why does everyone care so much? This is a HOLY WAR that is half a world away, fighting over land for hundreds of years. It's like kids playing in the playground, but they all have been given knives, and everytime a kid looses their knife, a adult gets up from the bench they were comfortably sitting on and hands them a new deadlier weapon, then sits back down and cheers for their kid to kill all the other kids."
"Palestine.
Khalistan.

Anything more to add to this list?"
stick em near the hudson strait somewhere
i can hear Legault giggling
Separatist within separatist?! Separatiception?

"FYI the word your looking for is ""condemned""

To condone something is to tentatively support it."
"Right, the same as all those pro-Russian people marches we see all the time."
"How do you compare this to Russia/Ukraine? If people were protesting in support of Russia- demanding Ukraine to stop defending themselves, you’d support this? I’m not saying it is the same as supporting Palestinians, but your post seems to indicate it…"
"Hamas is the government in Gaza. They were elected by the people there. They are funded by every Arab country in the area, while at the same as Palestinians are rejected by those same arab countries (the border between Gaza and Egypt is highly militarized)."
"Let's use the Russia vs Ukraine conflict as an example,  should pro-hamas news sources, like al jazeera,  be banned from cable packages and deranked from searches like RT? Should protests in Canada waving Russian flags be banned?"
">  As a non-aligned person, it’s no different from a Russia vs Ukraine. Innocent lives are being destroyed because of some mad man, some greed, some politics but is one is supported and is not. 

exactly, it's a strong bully nation massacring a mostly civilian population"
Lol this bigger challenge of population you speak of is being addressed through war
"Hamas isn't just a terrorist group but the governing authority of the Gaza Strip. What happened was the equivalent of a state's military invading, attacking, and capturing civilians of another state. Politically, any respectable state would go into full out war.

War is an ugly thing and many innocent people die because of poor decisions of their government. Please stop with the narrative that Israel is instigating this war. If Israel does not fight back with full force, even when the instigators are hiding among their civilians, it would set up a precedent that Israel cannot defend itself and all its Muslim neighbors would be plotting together to wipe Israel off the map (again)."
"Another example of protestors coming out in support of Hamas. ""Hamas's actions are justified"" she says... 

https://twitter.com/OnlinePalEng/status/1713489090467778943?s=20"
Nicely put!
"These protests are simply anti-israel hate fests organized by Muslim supremacists and their gullible leftie pets. If they truly cared about Palestinian welfare, then they would demand Hamas to release the hostages, stop spending all aid resources on terror and disband as an organization."
"Education people don't control our populas. 

Power hungry maniacs do. You don't get into those leader positions with out being like a lot a lot power hungry"
"Not a terrorist. Elected government organization that ran on the platform they are doing. 

I they still hold majority support in Gaza."
"They’re happening all over the world, including places like NYC and San Francisco.

I know people don’t agree with their cause here, but as long as they don’t resort to violence they can continue to protest"
So when will Trudeau freeze their Bank accounts?
You're acting like it's just Palestinians in these protests.
"totally, we should just be unconditionally supporting the state that's carrying on an ethnic cleansing with the support of other Euro-American countries. far less embarrassing"
"it's pro-Palestine, not pro-Hamas. This is nothing like the freedom convoy"
"Everyone's gotta bring the freedom convoy in.. at least those canadians stood up for themselves. Eventually we're going to have to stand up to the rising cost of rent as well as stand up for the amount of people we've been letting into this country. its all coming and if you can't see the utter degrowth of the country don't worry soon it will be at the front door because your going to be stepping over the homeless and the drug addicts coping to deal with the state of this dark new reality.

I'm tired of my country fighting over pro nouns and gender ideology I'm tired of hearing people say they're one $500 emergency from being financially ruined. canada has got to come together and that means a freedom convoy attendee like myself coming together with someone who disagrees with the convoy and start work out a way  to change the system. Because if we don't, we're not going to leave much of a world for our kids/future generations.

I love all you canadians. we can do better. we have to come together and put our differences aside."
"If you refuse to open your eyes to the atrocities being committed by the other side, just remember in WW2 you wouldn't be the one helping the Jews. This is how genocide is normalized."
Lol the irony is that the only reason the Europeans ended up here is because they were looking for a short cut to find India. Maybe you should go home first.
Can you guys ship them to the West Bank?
"Protesting against genocide? Send em home boys, we don’t do that here 😎"
"In London this dude Mohammed Hijab is going around with a group saying things like ""We will find some jews"" ""We want their blood""

https://twitter.com/ezralevant/status/1713285300770726074"
Hamas was established by Israel
"They are. But celebrations (yes, these were very much celebratory protests) IMMEDIATELY in the wake of horrific terror attacks are not the right time to do this if you’re actually pro-Palestine."
"Because Jewish blood matters more to Canadians and the rest of the western world, that’s the truth. No amount of protesting is going to change it. 

People bringing up what Hamas has done and how it justifies killing thousands of more children on the other side."
Yes and it’s a tragedy that they have Hamas as their leaders because under Hamas they have never had a future .
[deleted]
The Palestinian people are in a tight spot. It has not been easy to empathize with a group of people who are unflinchingly supportive of the act of beheading human babies.
lots of people here support neo-nazi confederate flag wavers.
most Canadians are spooked by this whole thing.
"Indirectly I'd argue it shows a different perspective from what the media are telling us(at least for TVA in Quebec). The reporting I see on TV is so outrageously biased towards Israel with big raw numbers like adult and children's death count and gruesome imagery while the other is just showing rubles with a quick glance at the number of people who ""perished"". 

These protests help to humanize the Palestinians. It shows that communities in Europe and NA cares about them and for the ordinary folks watching the news at home, it might keep them on the fence instead of falling for the propaganda of the media and for the most curious of them, this divide between protest and reporting might get them to educate themselves on the matter. 

As much as I would want these protests to help, I doubt they will have a direct impact too. I hope that at the very least, people see these protests and questions why they are happening."
"Huge crowds showed up all over the world to protest Israel’s war crimes and apartheid. Their regime relies on the myth that it’s the victim, and the massive resistance to that narrative shows that it’s failing."
"I giggle every time I hear someone say ""Free Palestine"" and that its an open air prison etc etc. 

Israel isn't stopping Palestinians from visiting Egypt."
"People are dying right now though, do we need for them all to be dead before we get your approval to protest?"
"Thank you, I am at a loss why people don't understand that throwing these protests right now is showing support for the recent attacks."
"Is it possible that some are holding rallies now, not in support of Hamas, but because they have been alive long enough to know what was coming next? Every time there’s an act of terrorism in Israel, Israel reacts and hundreds or thousands of Palestinians die. Always and fully a disproportionate response. 

The Israelis knew the risk of civilian casualties when they would drop their bombs in Gaza and decided _that’s acceptable_. And made the same choice when they shut off water and electricity. Every moment they’re making decisions that the civilians lives in Gaza are worthless. It’s disgusting. They could pause at any time, but they’re not. 

This is a good measure of moral judgement. Israel has every advantage over Palestine. They can do whatever they want. They could literally flatten the city if they wish. They could send in surgical strike teams. They could pressure Qatar and Lebanon and Syria to give up Hamas’ leadership. They’re _choosing_ to bomb hospitals and apartment buildings and convoys trying to flee. Even if they’re not intentionally doing it, it’s happening and they’re not stopping. That’s a choice."
They weren't holding them 2 weeks ago because Hamas waited for the anniversary of a previous war to launch their attack. Rallies and such are typically held on that anniversary anyways.
"Rallies for pro Palestine have been happening for decades and it's nothing new. But these protests are popping up AGAIN now because thousands of civilians are dying RIGHT NOW, people losing their homes RIGHT NOW and more displacement in the hundreds of thousands. The media does not give them justice, our government has never given them justice or acknowledgement. So the protest are more so to bring attention to injustices that everyone else is so willing to write off and continue to ignore.

I'll add, there seems to never be a good time to protest for the Palestinian people.  Especially when violence escalate and they are directly suffering, it seems to be the worst time to bring up their suffering. They can never be ""perfect"" victims in the eyes of the Western media, maybe even subhuman if you will."
I think the first step to peace should probably be to remove genocide from the terrorists Government charter.
"Well when it’s your people that getting kidnapped and raped then killed, the option of peace is off the table till the main reason of such savagery is removed we will not rest."
"Well surprise, as an israeli arab i do want my country to het back at these terrorists organization in Gaza that also 70% of Gaza’s population in support of and i do want to feel protected in my country, when you attack to kill innocent people, rape women, behead kids and kidnap civilians, my country will attack back and in folds, so shut up!"
"Yup, they get to imply these rallies are filled with terrorists to stoke fear and hate against a foreign minority group all the while scapegoating and slandering the left. The right would never let an opportunity to be an evil ghoul go to waste if it means they can use it as a distraction from their goals and prevent any positive progress from being enacted."
This isn't a pro hamas demonstration.
"It's a pro-Palestine protest to draw attention to human rights violations conducted by Israel via illegal siege. 

I didn't see any quotes about hamas support cited. To be even more specific:


""Ghazal urged people to make a distinction between the Palestinian people and the Hamas militants who are accused of committing atrocities against Israeli civilians. Just as Hamas doesn't represent all Palestinians, the same can be said about Israeli leadership, she added."""
Your post literally says pro-Palestinian. Maybe google Hamas?
"Well Hamas is only dubbed a terrorist organization by the EU, Canada, USA, Australia, Japan and Paraguay. Which is roughly the same club that doesn't recognize Palestine and part of that group is responsible for making Israel in the first place. 

These demonstrations in Canada are also largely about Palestine being free and independent in the face of the Israeli retaliation after the attack. So it would be an aggressive stretch to crucify people participating in them because they aren't pro Hamas by any stretch."

Pas de h orns h onking.
"Hamas shut down water, food, and power to the Gaza Strip.  They also bombed ((6000 times!) the Gaza Strip and killed thousands of Palestine’s. A third of those death have been children. Hamas isn’t every Palestinian civilian in the Gaza Strip."
Stop spreading misinformation
"So since Israel is committing war crimes presently in Gaza and the West Bank, does that mean any and all support for Israel right now is tacitly supporting Israeli state sponsored terrorism?"
"Because it isn’t a pro-Hamas demonstration, stupid."
Stop making to be a war against Israel. It’s a war against Jews and always has been.
and Palestine made it a war against Israel.
"I would pay 3 dollars for it , it’s too sad that it being sold for free."
"From themselves would be a start. 

Who's stopping Palestinians from visiting Egypt?"
From the river to the sea
"no no, CBC doesnt attach labels, didint you hear?

apparently, its not CBCs job. They simply bring both opinions to the viewer in neutral terms, and leave it at that. BBC too.

Now, i think i want to hear from hitler, for a balanced perspective on the jewish solution. CBC is my platform of choice.

I get where CBC is coming from, but we arent dealing with a harmless topic here. If a state-funded channel cannot bring itself to draw a clear line under terror - then we dont need a state funded channel."
"As long as large-scale protests are strictly anti-Israel with more radical individuals openly supporting Hamas, the whole movement will be viewed as pro-Hamas. If you actually condemn both sides, you understand Hamas consistently derails any attempts of a peaceful resolution and you seek to end the situation without completely destroying one of the sides, it's about damn time to start waiving ""fuck Hamas"" flags at least in West."
"and we shouldn't marching to stop the war crimes of killing babies, killing innocent people in a music festival?"
"Well when the Palestinians in gaza voted in Hamas to be their representative and Hamas chose to act in such savagery, kidnapping kids and women, raping and killing people inside their homes, israel as a country will defend itself and attack back till these terrorists are off this earth, they attack us then they cry about it, boo fuckin hoo as an israeli arab we will not feel safe till we get our sense of safety back after such terrorism."
"Just like Germany in 1940 invading Poland, they weren't Nazi's, they were just pro-German.

You ask 100 of these people what should happen to Israel and they will all say it should be wiped off the map."
"You mean like this march in London, UK where the protestors are saying ""we'll find some jews"" ""we want their blood"" ?

https://twitter.com/ezralevant/status/1713285300770726074"
They're happening too and are being widely reported on.
"Because Canada keeps immigrating people from those countries, and they bring their problems from home to Canada, and Canadians don't exactly feel comfortable about having potential domestic terrorists as neighbours."
I’m pretty sure it’s a war over the material conditions of Palestinians under an oppressive system of apartheid. But I guess they are different religions so maybe it’s that. Probably the denial of clean drinking water but — no. No that would too reasonable. Clearly a holy war!
"Why should you care? Because there are huge Muslim populations everywhere, and when Gaza is annihilated, what kind of chaos and violence are the angry muslims here going to cause?"
"It will spill over.

There are thousands of years worth of grudges and scores to settle there. All its going to take is the match to get lit, and its going to be a war unlike any we've ever seen until one group remains, and the others cease to exist.

My biggest fear here is that Iran gets involved one way or another. there is even a possibility they have a nuke by now. Israel already has nukes. And then there are the Sunni and Shia Muslims who would happily genocide each other off the face of the Earth if they feel the opportunity is there.

I think there is a 50/50 chance that Israel annexes Gaza, at least the northern part. Which will displace a million + people and lead to a massive humanitarian catastrophe. And my fear is that Israel might make a move on the Temple Mount, because if that happens WW3 will officially begin."
Because people understand that we all live on the same planet and that public opinion on the matter influences others.
"It's a joke, bud. Don't take it so seriously."
Don't you need to be part of the country before you seperate from the country?
They do have a right to resist. They just don’t have a right to attack innocents and children.

"Thanks, edited."
"How? It doesn't take a big brain to realize Palestine and Ukraine are both the small, weaker population being bullied by a more powerful state"
"it's just left wing mental gymnastics, they will use whatever excuse to support their side."
"I have a much easier time picking sides in the Russia-Ukraine war.  The Isreal-Palestine conflict is much more of a knot of problems that are difficult to resolve.  So many past grievances, so many factions, so many human rights abuses from both sides.  Who loses?  The victims.  Who is winning?  The extremist elements on both sides.  Each atrocity further polarises the side of the victims, which creates impetus for further atrocities the other way.

Hamas is the product of Israeli oppression of the Palestinians, much as Israeli expansionism is the product of previous conflict.  There have been brief periods of peace and even signs of attempts at resolution of the problems in the region, but it is too easy for extremists to gain support by antagonising the other side to do something awful.

I don't support Hamas, nor do I support the oppression of the Palestinian people.  There are too many political players gaining power by playing on the emotions caused in these conflicts.  None of them are working for the benefit of the people in the region.

The atrocities committed by Hamas I am convinced were planned in order to provoke the response it has provoked.  By responding as they have, Isreal is going to further radicalise the population of Gaza and possibly the West Bank.  Hamas gets what they want.  Israeli militants get what they want.  The people of both areas pay the price.  What a sh*t show."
"It's funny because you're inverting the analogy!! How is Russia equivalent to Hamas??? Hamas is a resistance, and let's not forget the west happily supported litteral Ukrainian Nazis against Russia..."
">Should protests in Canada waving Russian flags be banned?

Yes. Support of any nation opposed to us should be banned. Russia, Iran, China etc"
In Sydney Australia they were chanting Gas The Jews
Lol you have this same energy for the truckers ?
"Isn't  it wrong to support group who is conducting mass bombing and taking innocent life.

Their should be line for freedom of speech at this point you could even argue that hitler was just using freedom of speech.  


Edit: I am not supporting Gaza or Israel this argument can be used both ways,I have my own problem to sort out before I take stand on this complex topic.  


My Point was If any person supports terrorist group and advocate violence for example if I support ~~ISIS~~   by law is their a way I can be stopped? or I can get away with freedom of speech."
Doesn’t it take 8 weeks of constant demonstrations to get that response?
"A ton of innocent people were *just* bombed (edit: murdered) from Palestine. If you support that, there’s something wrong with your thought process."
The “ethnic cleansing” line is so lazy and so far from reality.
"Right the ethnic cleansing, even though the Palestinian population has been growing rapidly over the past 20 years plus. How does that work?"
"There have always been pro-Palestinian protests in Canada, but they’ve been relatively small(ish) and quiet. 

These are not them. 

These are large celebrations immediately in the wake of unspeakable atrocities and are implicit, if not explicit in their support of Hamas."
What does that even mean. Why would pro Palestine people go demonstrate right now? They are just supporting the hamas attack
It's worse
It is 100% Pro Hamas. It's bullshit to claim otherwise.
so you are saying  freedom convoy is pro-Hamas?
Freedom convey wasn’t really standing up for anything but qnon bullshit.
"I totally agree, I can detect a heartfelt comment.

Revolutionary socialism already has the answers if you're open to those ideas, unlike some of the cynics in r/canada."
"Yes except the Convoy people also believe in wackadoodle bullshi conspiracy theories, they are con artists and grifters, and they have an incoherent chaotic vision fueled by lots of drinking and drugs. So no they are not standing up for me at all."
">utter degrowth of the country

What do you mean by this? I'm not really familiar with this ""degrowth"" thing."
"The way to change the system is to elect politicians that fall center, so Canadians don’t need to worry about losing abortion/lgbtq+ rights but also not have out of control spending"
Who isn’t opening their eyes? I didn’t say there wasn’t a discussion here. But out waving flags in this country when Israel just got bombed and innocent people were just raped and murdered there in mass is disgusting.
Lmfao what does this comment even mean?
I meant home to their literal home… like houses? Wtf.
Hamas stands for Islamic Resistance Movement in Arabic. It was started by Palestinians
Not true
"Do you assume every protest supporting the Palestinians is also directly supporting Hamas? When is the right time to support Palestinians if, by your short description, supporting Palestine right away is supporting Hamas?"
Perhaps they’re protesting the 2000 dead / 9000 wounded Palestinian civilians with more to come???
"Everyone wants to play coy, but it's clear what those celebrations were about and I'm tired of people trying to wriggle free of their own personal ""gas the jews"" sentiment"
"I wouldnt say the majority are celebrations. Not even close. It sure would seem that some would want to elude to that to detract from the real issue.
It's more about bringing attention to the unjust and continued revenge killings/crimes that Israel is doing at the moment that the media refuses to acknowledge. To simply say they are celebrating terrorism is a tradegy for the real lost Palestinan lives and lost homes. It's a great way to continue silencing the issue as the media and western governments are absolutely doing..."
Wrong. It's the perfect time. While 100s of children in Gaza are being slaughtered.
"If not now, then when?"
"Stop being naive. If Israel doesn't fight back, their Muslim neighbors would see this as weakness and start an alliance to wipe Israel off the map. And yes, this has happened before."
"lol, no it doesn’t."
"Do you realize that Palestine includes the West Bank, where there is no Hamas? Thats where the apartheid is happening."
Yeah as soon as Muslims stop being hypocritical and killing homosexuals then i will start caring. Why would I care for people that want to kill me?
"Ah yes the 40 beheaded babies that the IDF has refused to verify lol

Not all palestinians support hamas, likely not even the majority"
The former prime minister of Israel smiled on TV when asked about the Palestinian babies in incubators who are *dying right now* because the incubators cannot run.
these protests make the right wing get more votes.
When they say Free Palestine they mean that the Jews should pack up and leave and give all Israel back to Muslims
"The border also used to be more open in 2005.

Palestinians in Gaza used that to attack Israel."
Perhaps their holding them now because thousands of civilians are dying right now to the retaliation
Peace be upon you inshallah
"There is no justification for this genocide.  

They are killing innocent people and have not killed any terrorists."
"Try being less distracted then, since Canada is in dire state."
"I get that they are not pro-Hamas. But it's really striking that their rhetoric is adamantly and vocally anti-Israel but not even remotely anti-Hamas. Saying ""I'm not pro-Hamas"" is not the same as being anti-Hamas."
Looks like one. Why else would they rally after a successful Hamas attack?
"“Hamas terrorists who committed atrocities against Israeli civilians.” 

Just thought I’d change that to it’s correct form."
Sieges for a military purpose are legal.
[deleted]
"You’re aware of what a dog whistle is correct?

These protest celebrations are a dog whistle in support of Hamas’ actions. They are very much pro-Hamas demonstrations masked as pro-Palestine, even if many won’t explicitly come out and say so. You just need to listen to what they say and don’t say. None are condemning the terrorist attack, which is implicit approval."
Hamas represents the 41% of Palestinians that voted for them.
What country are we in again?
"You forgot the UK. 

Hamas has also made enemies of Egypt, Jordan, and the UAE who have stopped short of calling them terrorists."
"Israel has promised to turn the power and water back on immediately after Hamas released the hostages.

So you're right, it is Hamas's fault."
"Wait, I have been advised the Israeli Military did that"

"For one, Hamas is not the armed forces of Palestine and as such is not recognized as a lawful combatant, they are not protected by the Geneva convention for one.
For two, Israel is not a member state of ICC, which gives ICC no jurisdiction over Israel.
For three, the convention of Hague and Geneva requires the party in control of the civilian population to not actively put civilians in heightened areas of harm by using them as human shields, which Hamas immediately loses any claims of considering their head quarters is the primary hospital of Gaza, Shifa Hospital. 

However, the moment Canada declared Israel a terrorist organization, out of principle I'll be happy to be on that wagon as well."
"Not really. Palestinians (muslims and Christians) didn't fight native Palestinian Jews (samaritans). It was actually the ashkenazi European jews who restricted their movement and religious freedoms.
Jews lived in Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon, Tunisia, Morocco, Turkey, Iran .. very comfortably. It wasn't until after the establishment of little Europe, a colony in the heart of the middle east that the tension spread due to Zionism going rampant."
Before or after their land was taken? Here let me come take over your front lawn you act rationally in response
😂
Bad deal. Egypt isn't taking it even when offered tens of billions.
"As much as I'm no expert in middle eastern affairs I do understand Hamas is a terrorist organization that uses the Palestinian people as a shield and consistently derails any attempt at peace with terms in opposition to their goals. 

I'm 100% with you that anti-Hamas demonstrations are in order, and based on MSM reports it seems some are happening, though not as many as most would want. 

My concern presently is that in all the cheap and easy ""we stand with Israel"" rhetoric from governments, we're overlooking the plight of the Palestinian people, including Canadian citizens of Palestinian event currently trapped in Gaza."
Obviously not and these kinds of half-baked retorts only serve to undercut the Israeli initiative to defend itself.
"If course not! That's different. Let's forget about that ok?

It's propoganda. Hamas didn't do that. Even Hamas said it wasn't them"
But they are; brutal colonial occupation tends to have consequences.
"And the IDF killing and injuring Palestinian civilians in their homes and on the streets in numbers 150x higher over the course of the past 20 years, (mostly in 2018-19, totally ignoring the other 55) is somehow something we should ignore because of that??"
I don't think many Canadians are happy with the current immigration plan.  This is just more fuel for the fire.
Have you never learned about the history of the land and the significance of the religious buildings and landmarks from the Israelites and Islamic communities there? This is the literally definition of a holy war.
"Israel is not going to take the Temple Mount. That's just such propaganda.

To be clear, Jews should absolutely be able to pray at their holy site, and it's beyond ridiculous that they can't without the Arab world declaring war on them. 

I don't think they'd want to annex Gaza. Any support they have now will be gone if they do that and it's not worth it in the long run."
"well definitely not thousands of years. Judaism has been around about 2500-3000 years, but Islam is not even 1500 years old."
"Ok.. so now when they *do* attack innocents and children (understatement of the fucking century right there), and suddenly all kinds of protests pop up supporting ""resistance""... Surely you're smart enough to put two and two together and realize that the ""resistance"" they're referring to is actually just killing innocents and children?"
"Their innocents and children have been attacked for generations now and nobody seems to ever want to do anything about it. Where is all the outrage for generations of terrorism and murder perpetrated by the occupying Israeli government, who in fact established Hamas"
Deport all freedom convoy people too.
100% people who don't support Canadian values shouldn't be in Canada it's how here turns into there.
"Deport me too, then, because that's a reasonable statement."
Why? He's right.
And there you go. The left has no morals or standing. Weaker? Let’s support them! Guilt. And maybe a little bit of fear.

"It’s an illegal occupation and all of this bloodshed is the fault of Israel, the occupying nation, and it’s enablers"
Hamas isn't a resistance. They only care about Palistinians as far as they can use them as human shields and hide in their buildings..
Hamas attacked Israel last weekend...
They are the  elected Palestinian Government that has genocide written in its charter.
"Ukraine= NATO ally.    
Israel= NATO ally.     
Russia= NATO enemy.    
Hamas= NATO enemy. Do you understand why we're supporting one and not the other? I understand you see Hamas' actions towards our citizens is ""resistance"", but Hamas isn't a Canadian ally."
Hamas is a terrorist org. Stop pretending.
"The equivalent would be if azov did a terrorist attack on Russia killing 1000 Russians on Russian soil and Russia attacked Ukraine because of the terrorist attack, then there being pro ukrainian protests here. But that did not happen"
So why exactly are we allowing Palestinian flags to be waved in Canada?
"Do you see how your suggestion is authoritarian, no different than the laws in Russia, Iran and China that I’m sure you claim to disagree with?"
Classy and peaceful religion crowd
in Toronto they had a truck leading the protest that had Taliban flags being flown from it
"Uh, being pro-Palestine isn’t the same as being antisemitic. This is disgusting and has no place at a pro-Palestine demonstration, or anywhere, for that matter."
"And a pro-Israel man in new york was saying kill all  Arabs, there have been bad actors in both groups

Free Palestine."
Plenty of videos of Israelis calling for the extermination of all Palestinians
"There are anti-vaccine and anti-mandate protesters that gather on overpasses to this day. You can see them every week.

Go ahead, do your thing. I mean it doesn’t make sense to me.

But if you start bringing long guns to a demonstration, or start putting up blockades at borders, I think we’ve moved past peaceful protest"
Pro-Palestine doesn't equal pro-Hamas necessarily. There are people here whose family members are affected by Israel's indiscriminatory bombings and deserve to let their opposition be heard.
Mass bombing like how Israel is doing to palastenians
"While nearly every fiber of my being wants to say no, we should not accept support for terrorists, freedom of expression says we have to.  I can't recall her name, but a judge recently put it well.  Something to the effect of part of free speech is odious speech."
"> Isn't it wrong to support group who is conducting mass bombing and taking innocent life.

Israel is currently doing this"
"Bombed would’ve been a nice way to go for many of them.

From a report of a woman on Israeli Channel 13 a few days ago.

"ethnic cleansing: Ethnic cleansing is the systematic forced removal of ethnic, racial, and religious groups from a given area, with the intent of making a region ethnically homogeneous

Exactly.
"Are they? Or are they in direct response to the IDF's continued aggressions? It's not as simple as you're making it sound. 

What Hamas did was disgusting but it doesn't absolve Israel and the IDF of their crimes. 

If we are ever going to make any progress we need to stop pretending this is a one sided war. The hate on both sides is disgusting."
Any protest attracts a variety of opinions. The majority there just want to end Israeli apartheid
"large celebrations? try again. 

Or literally read any of their placards, listen to what they're saying. They're protesting against IDF atrocities against an innocent civilian population (which the UN and MSF both consider war crimes btw) )in response to the Hamas attack.."
Because Palestinians are being killed..?
"The hamas attack is over, and they wont be breaching israel again for some time.  Meanwhile Israel has cut off all food, water and power to 1 million children (collective.punishment aka war crime).  Any reasonable person should be protesting

Not to mention warning 1 million people to.move in 24 hours, which everyone has acknowledged is impossible

Their mind is made up). By taking the commercial break to ""denounce Hamas,"" you basically say ""the actions of Hamas in this solitary moment are the core focus and not the 75 years of oppression that Palestinian civilians have experienced at the hands of the Israeli government."""

True however the big difference is all those places say Palestine is a real place, everyone who says Hamas is a terrorist group also says there is no such country. Egypt, Jordan and UAE have listed themselves as enemies of Hamas however they see Palestine as a free nation so they aren't willing to call what's in essence the military of the occupied region a terrorist group, as there is that line.

Literally every sentence you said was wrong. Go read some history books.
Yes very comfortably
"""It wasn't until after the establishment of little Europe""

What happened before that? I think there might have been something. Maybe some kind of nationalist or socialist movement that Palestine and most of the Arab world supported?

I wonder what it could have been. I guess since you're allergic to history books, we will never know."
"You do understand. Most of pro-Palestine organizations and clubs even in the West even among presumably educated people [do not](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pro-palestinian-letter-harvard-students-provokes-alumni-outrage-2023-10-10/). 

Anti-Hamas protests are indeed many years due, but so far we've mostly seen what we've seen - [celebrations of the terrorist attack](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/hamas-celebrations-stopped-in-berlin-amid-warning-of-attacks-on-jewish-sites/ar-AA1hSndD) everywhere Palestinians now live and constant blaming Israel in everything."
"[UN data on casualties in Palestina](https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties). As you can see, less than 800 people were killed in clashes with Israeli in Gaza since 2014, and those numbers include valid military casualties. And then Hamas came and doubled that number in one Saturday.

Same source, you can also see that the ratio of Arab/Israeli fatalities was less than 6:1 for Palestine overall and slightly above 2:1 for Gaza. Not even close to 150x."
No that’s a material war between people with religions. People with differing religions exist in every country on earth including the Middle East. The difference is that most aren’t put into ghettos. The existence of holy sites does not make a war. That literally not the literal definition of a holy war.

More children have been murdered by Israel in the past two weeks than by Hamas.
Bingo.
"Wait, if killing civilians and children is the line, I can't support either side"
"So... by that logic its okay if first nation's people kidnapped out kids and took them to residential schools? 

I don't remember Israel giving specific orders to kill civilians. They always target them directly; but they hide in civilian areas. Is Israel not supposed to defend itself?

Hamas was a pro social movement before becoming militant; so this as valid an argument as saying the democrats supported segregation in the south, ignoring the changes too those organizations."

And the protestors told the truck to leave
"Then why is it happening in so many of them?

Did you see the one where they were wearing shirts of the paragliders with rifles that gunned down all those innocent kids enjoying themselves at a party? And raped many of them while they were lying next to their dead friends before executing them and adding them to the pile?

Why are lunatic antisemites like the 2 in this video able to go up there and call for the extermination of Jews under the guise of “resistance” and then getting cheered on by the *entire crowd*? https://x.com/raz_sauber/status/1712513158613483569

Seems like a massive PR problem to me. A poll came out yesterday showing only 8% of Americans want the government to criticize Israel https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/the-war-between-israel-and-hamas/.

Palestinians have lost a *shocking* amount of support and goodwill this week based on how disgusted the Western world is with Hamas’ ISIS brand of terrorism and the tacit Palestinian approval of Hamas going on at these rallies."
">But if you start bringing long guns to a demonstration, or start putting up blockades at borders, I think we’ve moved past peaceful protest

So the peaceful protestors in Ottawa, who didn't bring long guns or blockaded any borders, should have been able to continue instead of having the emergency act thrown at them?"
Issue is there are tons of videos of normal Palestinian civilians spitting on dead idf corpses/kicking them. Trying to beat hostages. Not all Palestinians are innocent in the actions of Hamas.
"1) These are the same people that were gleefully celebrating the Hamas terror attack the other day. 

2) Israel told civilians to flee to the south as they would begin attacking Hamas cells. Israel is literally telegraphing what they are gonna do so innocents can leave if they want to.

It equals pro Hamas if the protest happens directly after Hamas bombed and murdered individual civilians from Palestine.

HamAss using gazans as human shields to elicit sympathy.
"isn't it wrong to support the the group using their own people as human shields?

If you are really concerned about innocent palestinians being killed and not just looking for an opportunity to attack Israel, you would /will protest Hamas using people as human shields, and turning civilian residences and infrastructure (including hospitals, UN schools, mosques) into valid military targets (according to the geneva conventions) as hamas places their  weapon factories, munition dumps, terrorist headquarters in these locations. You would/will protest Hamas using their populace as human shields"
Agree.
"The 48 war of independence/nakba/Arab-Israeli war literally happened because the Palestinian leadership rejected the UN plan and started a war they couldn’t and didn’t win. It retaliation, every single Arab state ethnically cleansed themselves of every single Jew. More Jews were pushed out of their Arab homes then Arabs were pushed out of Israel.

If israel wanted to remove all Arabs from the area, it would be done. Instead, the population of Palestinians has only grown, the birth rate is very high, and Israel it’s self is 20% Palestinians.

Israel is guilty of many things, but the laziest thinking goes on towards labeling those things."
">Or are they in direct response to the IDF's continued aggressions?

My dude.

Hamas quite literally invaded Israel, killed over a thousand civilians that they *deliberately targeted*, paraded corpses through streets, decapitated and burned babies, and finally retreated back to Gaza with hostages, where they are now blocking escape routes, trapping Palestinian civilians in what will soon become a combat zone.

But no, we gotta talk about *Israeli* aggression? Gtfo with that shit.

The biggest threat to Palestinian lives isn't Israel, it's fucking Hamas.

>If we are ever going to make any progress we need to stop pretending this is a one sided war. The hate on both sides is disgusting.

When was the last time Israel deliberately targeted civilians *as a matter of policy*? When was the last time Israel wrote into their official documents that they won't be satisfied until all Palestinians are dead? When was the last time Israel attacked completely unprovoked?

Seriously. Go read Hamas' charter. They quite explicitly call for the eradication of Jews and the elimination of Israel. How can you possibly look at that and say ""yeah both sides"" as if they're remotely similar."
"Yes, celebrations. There's one going on in Ottawa right now."
So were innocent people from Israel. That’s the point.
Hamas capture 150 girls ... Imagine what they live right now... I hope they are dead and not gang rape 24/7
"I’m saying don’t celebrate a place where people marched out of and just slaughtered innocent people. If you are truly more worried about innocent people, support the Jewish that were lost as well. 

Do you honestly think Israel is just suppose to make an assumption ‘oh well gosh darn it, they hopefully won’t kill another few hundreds of us now’ when a bunch of people from their country were literally just randomly slaughtered? You think they saw the light and have their fill of murdering Jewish people now?"
"It isn't a war crime to cut off resources to an enemy especially for a military objective.

Israel said they would allow resources when the hostages are returned"
The alternative is the civilian stays and gets caught in the cross fire as they move in to remove Hamas. Not sure if peopel would agree that’s a better option.
Why would you celebrate otherwise?
"""If I don't know, it's probably racist!"""
"It was a lot better financially under conservatives, and a lot better socially under liberals."
So after how many years or generations can people actually call this country their home?
"Yeah you are so so so so off with your assumptions. You have my ancestry wrong as well as ‘home’ here means a house… with like, a sofa and TV. The actual literal meaning of home"
It's not ''hard to say'' its very simple. you have a few small gathering of dipshits who support hamas and then you have large gathering of people supporting palestine. It's an easy distinction.
"how dare you contextualize the last few decades of this conflict? are you a terrorist sympathizer? obviously hamas is reprehensible! they murdered innocent people!  decades of dead palestinians don't matter, there can be no justification for that! and that's why i stand with israel as they drop apartment blocks and starve out upwards of 2 million innocent people! it's justified and they have a right to respond!!! /s"
"That wasn't verified, you are spreading misinformation 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/10/12/middleeast/israel-hamas-beheading-claims-intl/index.html

The point you seem to be making is that only Israeli babies matter and palestinian babies don't? Because no more Jewish babies are going to die in the coming weeks but hundreds of palestinian babies will be dying based on war crimes perpetrated by israel"
I understand
Left/Right = another distraction.
"About 25% of Hamas' own rockets fall into Gaza because they can't aim for shit, so thats not true."
Mmmmmmm
Do you think Hamas didn't know that would happen? Do you think Hamas thought they were going to overthrow the Israeli government and defeat it's military? It's obvious Hamas went for maximum outrage.
"No they aren't and sieges are legal for military objectives.

Do you expect Ukraine to supply a Russian army and civilians in Crimea?

Do you think Canada should stop it's sanctions that are harming Russian people?"
"100% agree. But I feel like this has been framed like no Palestinians support Hamas which is just untrue. It's a disaster what is happening, but people seem to only be putting responsibility on Israel and the Palestinians do play a rather large part in this historical conflict."
"No one deserves to die. They should evacuate and we should provide aid. If they are young, they should be able to walk 10 miles."
"See my comment below with a more recent poll from July of this year. 

And no, they absolutely do not deserve to die and I hope no children or innocent civilians die. Don't try and manipulate my words. What I do wish is that Hamas is wiped off the face of this Earth."
"This is the weird new propaganda line on reddit thats making the rounds, because it tries to remove the agency of Hamas from Palestinians' own political agency.

Israel funding early Hamas needs context

back in the 70s, the PLO wasnt the pathetic 86 year old dictator Abbas that could barely hold his party together from collapse, it was a worldwide threat that killed jews in a dozen countries around the world. It was viewed back then the same way we saw ISIS today. It nearly overthrew the kingdom of jordan in an event we call [Black September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September), it was a major actor and nearly collapsed Lebanon into civil war. It performed a [terror attack/massacre at the Munich Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_massacre) and killed all of Israel's athletes. It committed attacks on American soil, including killing [Robert F. Kennedy's father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirhan_Sirhan).

You know why Canada has an anti-terror unit with an allocated budget? It was created to fight PLO cells in the country from killing Canada's jews. (Along with the FLQ, which trained with the PLO and the IRA)

Hamas started out as an offshoot of the muslim brotherhood, and was only a humanitarian islamic charity at first, not a terror organization. Israel saw it as a natural counterbalance to the secular PLO, and tried to help finance an alternative to it.  Hindsight is 20/20 yea, but back then it was deemed an obvious solution. You obviously try to finance and legitimize the least violent party in the conflict.


This was the pre-existing organization that directly launched Hamas

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mujama_al-Islamiya

It was, in Wikipedia's words:

> Mujama al-Islamiya was recognized by Israel in 1979 as a charity, allowing the organization to set up the Islamic University in Gaza (IUG) and build mosques, clubs, schools,[1] and a library in Gaza,[2] besides other social services. 

This was the alternative to Yasser Arafat at the time. I would have 100% gone for it back then if I was a Israeli leader and didn't have the gift of hindsight that strengtening Islamic elements in any country, no matter if they were mujahideen or hamas, would eventually backfire.

> In 1987, during the First Intifada, Yassin and six other Mujama Islamist members launched Hamas, originally calling it the ""paramilitary wing"" of the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood, and Yassin became its spiritual leader. He also claimed responsibility for a number of suicide attacks targeting Israeli civilians, and Hamas was designated a terrorist organization.[5] By that time, Mujama controlled an estimated 40% of mosques in Gaza. Mujama's institutions would become crucial to Hamas's terrorist activities. They were and continue to provide cover for raising, laundering and transferring funds, facilitate the group's propaganda and recruitment efforts, provide employment for its operatives, and serve as a logistical support network.[6]"
"You're in Canada, and the Canadian government has decided Hamas is a terrorist organization. If you condone the actions of Hamas, it makes you an ally of a nationally recognized terrorist organization. That makes you an enemy of Canada. That makes you a threat to the safety of the nation and her people."
They would if Poland had those hostages from invading Germany slaughtering hundreds of civilians including women and children then following it up by parading them through the streets stripped naked while the average Polish citizen spat on them.
"If Poland took a hundred German kids hostage, I would."
"Hamas actively uses civilian structures, including the hospital as the center of operations.

Hamas WANTS civilian casualty and are not following the conventions of war."
"Children dying is never cool, give your head a shake."
Wait what?
"Yes. My dad tells me of old Damascus. Jews lived in the best suburbs in the heart of the city. They were mostly merchants and craftsmen. They were well respected and trustworthy.
I hear same stories from friends from Baghdad and Yemen. Check who actually got them out. It was the mosad with their bombs to scare them to move to Israel. There are testimonies right on YouTube with eyewitnesses and names of operatives.
Jews had their golden age under Islamic Chalifate in Andalusia before the Spanish inquisition massacred them and the muslims too."
"Really?
There's a whole documentary on samaritan jews of Palestine and how bad they were treated by European Zionists.
They still have the peace covenant of the second Chalifate Omar Ibn Alkhatab."
"Yes. My dad tells me of old Damascus. Jews lived in the best suburbs in the heart of the city. They were mostly merchants and craftsmen. They were well respected and trustworthy.
I hear same stories from friends from Baghdad and Yemen. Check who actually got them out. It was the mosad with their bombs to scare them to move to Israel. There are testimonies right on YouTube with eyewitnesses and names of operatives."
"Your comment leads to nowhere, really."
"Did you even read your own resource?
Revisit that link and play with the sliders again. You made a mistake with the Power BI interface. Also made a mistake with the timeframe considering I said ""last 20 years"" and not ""last 10ish.""

Your resource roughly backs up my casualty totals, if you compare it against my *actual* claim. My only mistake was that the violence has been sustained consistently rather than exponentially spiking at any specific point."
The materials they fight over are religious sites............... Israel is called the holy lands......
They've been saying the Jews will take the Temple Mount for decades as a way to further the cycle of violence. It's not gonna happen. Anybody who has been paying attention the last 20 years knows it's just propaganda.
"I'm not saying that people genuinely believe that killing kids is ok.

I'm saying that these people are so blinded by partisan thinking that they can't separate Hamas from Palestine, or Hamas' actions from the Palestinian liberation movement.

Like let's just say, as a purely hypothetical scenario, that the war in Ukraine settles down. They're not at peace, but there's no active fighting. Next let's say that that one Ukrainian brigade that's apparently filled with Nazis (I'm not totally familiar with them, but you get the idea) decided to go into Russia and just started killing anyone and everyone they came across, slaughtering whole villages.

And then within days of that, people start holding massive rallies for Ukrainian solidarity and supporting the Ukrainian resistance movement.

Would you not see that Nazi brigade's actions as terrorism and not representative of the Ukrainian people? Would you not then also see the sudden uptick in Ukrainian resistance rallies immediately following the act of terrorism as rather suspect?

Note: I am not remotely suggesting that Ukraine is anything like Palestine or that Russia is anything like Israel, just trying to illustrate the point with another conflict that people might not have as deep-seated opinions on."
"That is also terrible, what's your point?"
"What a weak argument.

The entire fucking border is militarized. It would've been impossible for Hamas to enter Israel without hitting military targets.

But they didn't stop there, did they?

Oh no, they kept going, slaughtering 260 people at an outdoor music festival: https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/supernova-music-festival-hamas-1.6994923

They breached the fence of a kibbutz and slaughtered anyone they could find: https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/bodies-residents-militants-lie-grounds-ravaged-israeli-kibbutz-2023-10-10/

They carried detailed maps with plans to specifically target schools and youth centers: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/top-secret-hamas-documents-show-terrorists-intentionally-targeted-elem-rcna120310

So tell me again how these are legitimate acts of ""resistance"".

Explain to me how they were being oppressed by a bunch of ravers (many of whom weren't even Israeli), farmers, and children."

"Lol, what Bingo? Israël's tally from last week is 400+ children."
Intention matters.
"And it was isreal which provided the funding to help militarize Hamas.

Your hypothetical comparison with first nations is irrelevant. I don’t support violence against innocent people and I don’t support Hamas, the militant group funded and militarized by isreal in its early stages, which wouldn’t exist today without that Israeli funding.

Nor do I support the illegal occupation of Palestine. Do you?"
No it isn’t. It’s illegal to support terrorists.
No people who don't agree with the core values of your country shouldn't be in your country. That's how your country regresses.
"I personally think that's a waste of time too, past has already happened you have to work with current actions."
The left is having a field day.
Fair
some*
how do you know thats what they said to them? i couldn't hear anything they said
"Who told you the lives and freedoms of Jews in the middle east is dependent on taking away the lives and freedoms of Palestinians, and why do you believe it?"
"There are extremists on both sides. 

For example, Israel’s president Isaac Herzog claimed in a press conference that there are no innocent civilians in Gaza, while thousands of Palestinians struggled to flee northern Gaza. 

This is a call for genocide against the two million civilians , 1 million of which are children in Gaza. 

The Israeli government has committed numerous war crimes in Palestine already as mentioned by the U.N, and humans rights watch organizations."
"No, those people were harassing the everyday normal citizens of downtown Ottawa because they didn’t agree with the way those people voted. The border blockages were much more justified than what was going on in Centretown."
Exactly. Said it for me.
"no shit? But let's not pretend collective punishment is the solution. We can't cast an entire demographic, half of which are children as evil and justify their deaths.

Also, if a military relocated you, killed your children and now claim you are evil because of the region you are born in is controlled by terrorists who committed an atrocity, you probably wouldn't be that receptive of Israeli soldiers. Hamas isn't a threat in the west bank, but that hasn't stopped settlers from making life hell for innocent people.

I think what gets lost in this entire new chapter of this conflict is how evil the IDF has always been. Just because they're better relative to literal terrorists doesn't excuse anything they have done or are doing. It reeks of the American war on terror and clearly will just basically guarantee the newest generation grows up as radicals."
"40% of the population is under 14, so that's a useless fact."
"Doesn't change the facts that thousands of innocent people have already died, and we are likely to see thousands more die in the coming weeks.

People are free to protest, even if they aren't on your side. As long as it isn't violent, it should absolutely be allowed."
"I don't give a shit. Civilians don't deserve to die just because all their values don't align with yours. I'm not going to condemn all of Israel for celebrating rocket strikes on Palestinian settlements either. Under this deranged mentality, you could justify wiping out any populace you were at war with throughout history."
"I think no one is supporting Hamas, They are just supporting innocent individual on both side of border."
It's also happening right after a widespread bombing campaign by Israeli.
"Israel declared war, issued warnings to civilians, established a public H-hour, and commenced a fire plan in accordance with the incoming assault.

This is literally warfare 101. Pretty much every military, in every capable war did this exact same thing.

Pretty much every single major invasion since 1912. 

Is it humane? No, is it different than what Hamas did a few days ago? Yes.

Hamas is responsible for the wellbeing of the Palestinian people as their government. They, without public support, invaded and murdered innocent civilians for the sole purpose of murder. What is Israel supposed to  do? 

If India sent troops into Pakistan with the orders of ""kill a bunch of innocent women and kids lol bye"". Would you expect Pakistan to declare war or to just sit around allowing it?

If they declared war, how do you think a ground force would move in? Probably following a mass bombing"
"https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_use_five_palestinian_children_as_human_shields#:~:text=Since%202000%2C%20DCIP%20has%20documented,fired%20heavily%20in%20their%20direction."
"""Don't bomb the human shields"" shouldn't be too hard to understand."
">But no, we gotta talk about Israeli aggression?

We can talk about both. That's the funny thing about wars, they tend to have more than one side and both sides can be quite capable of doing wrong. 

>When was the last time Israel deliberately targeted civilians as a matter of policy?

Officially? 

>How can you possibly look at that and say ""yeah both sides"" as if they're remotely similar.

Because both sides are doing disgusting shit? How can you possibly be ok with children in Gaza being massacred? Women being raped? That's ok in your book? Honestly?

Fuck that."
"> killed over a thousand civilians

Oh boy don’t look up how many dead Palestinian civilians there are."
And are people being restricted from supporting Israel? I may have missed the articles complaining about those.
They're all victims of apartheid. Every incident recalls sentiments of the entire conflict between Zionists and Palestinians
">I’m saying don’t celebrate a place where people marched out of and just slaughtered innocent people

For the record, protesting is not 'celebrating'. If there are those out there celebrating and chanting the disgusting hate chants we've heard then we can have the police do their jobs and charge them appropriately."
"Do you think these incidents occur in a vacuum and that their desire for a peaceful resolution to the conflict was any different than it was the day before the attack?

No one expects Israel to do nothing and from the same perspective, Do you honestly think Palestine is going to do nothing and make an assumption, oh well gosh darn it, they're probably done playing genocide now."
"They're also not blocking all resources. They've said they'll allow food/water/medicine through. They're just not *providing* electricity, fuel, or internet."
"It's not celebratory, it's a protest against the genocide happening in Gaza **right now**. Have you read the article?"
"And after Europeans leave, the indigenous population in Canada should go back over the Bering land bridge too! This was wooly mammoth country long before they colonized this country."
I'm not agreeing with OC's framing just showing the logical conclusion it leads to.
"They can also protest if they choose, it's called freedom."

"Lol no, the right is engaged in class warfare on behalf of the wealthy and the left is what fights against them. This whole distraction is an attempt to manipulate people into supporting the right against their best interests instead of the left by slandering and denigrating them, calling them terrorist supporters. They have no game and will use any lie to further their goals. Left vs right is really the only conflict that matters as all others are a distraction to prevent us from fighting it together as a unified working class."
Source?
"And you think playing into their hands is the best solution ? Whether this is true or not what does it matter, Hamas is a terrorist organisation that doesn’t value human life and Israel has now fallen to their level"
"They are committing genocide, the likes of which is quickly becoming universally condemned. 

They have become the bad guys."
"Yea I totally agree with you. Unfortunately, there are a lot of Palestinians who have been radicalized due in part to the circumstances/environment they're in. From constant propaganda from a young age propagated by terrorists who use them as human shields, to living in an apartheid like state because of all the historical violence. Some of the rhetoric has been absolutely abhorrent too. I've seen way too many people support Hamas as freedom fighters without having a clue about who or what they do. Hamas are terrorists and there's a reason why they've been designated as such by our government."
"Yes a poll from hamas, totally reliable

Do you think asking a question is manipulating your words? Interesting perspective"
He supported funding hamas as recently as.2019 lol
"The Canadian government also deemed vaccines to be important, yet that didn't stop you from getting into your truck and driving to Ottawa OP lol"
"Well again firstly these are pro Palestine protests not Hamas so there is that.

Perhaps but that seems like a very easy way for the Canadian government to dub anyone they like a threat to National safety. If all they need to prove or falsify is that you have spoken in a positive light about the actions of a group. But maybe free speech is meant to be selective."
Why do you keep conflating Hamas with Palestinians?
"Why in the hell is ""don't kill kids"" a rule that you monsters think there should be exceptions to?"
I am saying it is not ok.
You replied to yourself as if you were someone else?
"I am just saying go after the Hamas, but they should  leave the Palestinians civilians out of it."
"I guess that totally makes up for the subsequent collaboration with Nazis and ethnic cleansing.

""See you had it so good before, so now it's time to die...."""
[deleted]
"""We treated them well before so the ethnic cleansing was okay!!!"""
Nowhere? That's the current location of the Jewish neighborhoods in Arab countries.
"The material concerns are access to water, electricity, farmland, medicine, autonomy, mobility rights, trade blockades et cetera. The day to day life of Palestinians are affected by real material grievances. That’s what allows Hamas to recruit and radicalize."
"Netanyahu has been given the excuse he needs to do pretty much whatever he wants, because Israel has not been attacked like this in decades.

I'm not saying that he will do it. But I will not be shocked if he does either. The same as I would not be shocked if he annexes northern Gaza, or attacks Iran.

I fully support Israel in their right to defend themselves. But that does not mean that Netanyahu is a rational or responsible leader either."
The lack of the same energy you spend towards one side.
"Hold on a second, are you sure the below wasn’t a military target? 

From a report of a woman on Israeli Channel 13 a few days ago.

>”My husband was shot in his legs. The terrorists ordered him to stand up, and when he couldn't they shot him dead. I had my baby on my shoulder, screaming. They shot her point blank, and through my shoulder. I am alive but dead"""
"Why is your outrage only one sided? 3x more children have been killed by Israel in the response to the Hamas attack. No outrage there. Over the past 15 years in Gaza alone order of magnitude more children have been killed by Israel, some at weddings, some walking on the beach, some collecting bottles, some at home, some playing. Killed by incredibly destructive and horrific weapons, missiles, burnt to a crisp by white phosphorous. We’re talking a number in the thousands. Atrocities that have few equals anywhere else in the world. Silence from you, Israel, and the international community."
What a disgusting take. Dead kids are collateral damage when their on the other side.
"Every unarmed civilian killed by an occupying force, yes. Collateral damage is  vile euphemism for murder, you are getting the hang of this."
"Would be close to 0 if Hamas terrorists weren’t using them as human shields. I’m sorry if it’s crass but that is the truth on the ground.

This is their playbook and comments like yours is precisely why they always go back to the same playbook. It always works."
Bullshit. The end result is the same
Supporting the Palestinians is not the same thing as supporting terrorism. Give your head a shake.
"Is one of the core values of our country supporting an apartheid state? 

Also, why is it up to you to decide what speech is acceptable?"
So you approve of everything that happened on Saturday? I’m just confirming and don’t want to put words in your mouth.
Doesn't genocide require killing most of the population?
"Solid whataboutism.

Do you approve of what happened on Saturday, yes or no?"
Harrassing them so bad we needed to literally declare war on them?
"As I said, not all Palestinians lol. Never said Israel hasn’t commited a massive amount of war crimes."
Supporting terrorists is not free speech. Our government was willing to freeze bank accounts for Canadians that simply donated money  to a cause to end sCovid mandates and all of a sudden bow they lost their teeth on terrorist supporters. SPINELESS.
"of course they can protest. 

my point was simply while pro-palestine doesn't necessarily = pro-hams it usually does, 

given the support Hamas has within the general Palestinian society - as indicated by the poll showing they would have won the Palestinian election."
"If you are really concerned about innocent palestinians being killed and not just looking for an opportunity to attack Israel, you would /will protest Hamas using people as human shields, and turning civilian residences and infrastructure (including hospitals, UN schools, mosques) into valid military targets (according to the geneva conventions) as hamas places their  weapon factories, munition dumps, terrorist headquarters in these locations. You would/will protest Hamas using their populace as human shields"
"supporting palestine, when a majority of palestinians support hamas is like supporting hamas.

supporting a community, where most of the community believes in ideology A is like supporting Ideology A, in this case the ideology of HamAss."
">I think no one is supporting Hamas,

Right.

>The Palestinians have a right to resist,” said protest participant Ghada Sasa, a PhD Candidate in political science at McMaster University and a third-generation Palestinian refugee.

>The group would not denounce the atrocities committed by Hamas.

>“I think that you by pointing your finger at Hamas, you are trying to delegitimize Palestinian resistance,” Sasa said.

>Hamas is not a terrorist group... Everything that they do is justified.""

https://twitter.com/realmonsanto/status/1713317504812978573"
"Yes. They are only against bombing Palestine, not Hamas in Palestine bombing Israel. That’s the point."
"Israel to Palestinians: ""Better get out the way, we about to bomb the shit out of the whole city! Good luck!"" 

I mean I guess that's better than nothing, but they are still knowingly and purposefully bombing and terrorizing innocent people."
"So if Palestine had just declared war they are free to kill as many civilians as they want? 

Kinda sounds like what you're describing is actually against the Geneva convention. Being attacked by a country does not in fact give you carte blanche to start Carpet bombing cities full of civilians."
"IFF it happened they were also wrong.

and that doesn't excuse the mass use HamAss makes of innocents as human shields. HamAss doesn't just take the opportunity to do so because it was convenient at the moment, HamAss does it as part of their strategy - over and over again - they plan for it.

HamAss HQ didn't just appear one day underneath the main hospital in gaza, and they took advantage of the situation, HamAss put it there to use the hospital as a human shield.

HamAss didn't just come across rocket launchers in residential neighborhoods, ready to use, they put them there intentionally.

HamAss didn't just discover a forgotten stache of weapons in a school, and take them to use in their war, HamAss stored them there.

HamAss doesn't care about lives, including their own, or their families, or their neighbors, or their community.   They are not just taking advantage of a situation, they are creating the situation."
"don't use human shields shouldn't be too hard to understand. 

if Joe-terrorist were to walk around with a dead-mans- switch. As soon as he dies, a building full of innocents will be blown up by explosives he placed there. Joe Terrorist now walks around the city picking off people that offend him.  Should Joe terrorist be allowed to kill anyone, and do whatever he wants because if you kill him innocents will be killed.  

If you support the use of human shields as an effective tactic, the result is that you have created the perfect/unassailable shield for any terrorist and criminal in any situation."
">We can talk about both. That's the funny thing about wars, they tend to have more than one side and both sides can be quite capable of doing wrong. 

I'm not taking issue with talking about both. I'm not particularly happy with some of Israel's actions and words since this all started.

I'm taking issue with characterizing this as ""Israeli aggression"". 

>Officially? 

So you have no answer? And yes, officially. Because Hamas' *official* policy is to kill Jews and eradicate Israel. It's literally in their founding charter, and dead militants have been found with maps and documents explicitly detailing plans to attack civilians.

>Because both sides are doing disgusting shit?

Surprisingly enough, I'm capable of seeing things with more nuance than ""bad = bad"".

One side deliberately targeted civilians and killed them in cruel and barbaric ways.

The other side does what it can to warn civilians ahead of strikes, but can only do so much because the enemy makes extensive use of human shields. Would you deny Israel the right to eliminate threats because those threats refuse to play by the rules?

>How can you possibly be ok with children in Gaza being massacred?

I don't have to be ok with it. But I can still understand that this is a situation with no good option, and I can still place the blame squarely on Hamas for not only *starting* this, but also for actively preventing those children from leaving.

>Women being raped?

Please source this utterly baseless accusation.

Now I know you've completely lost the plot. Hamas are the one who engaged in mass rape."
"> When was the last time Israel deliberately targeted civilians as a matter of policy?

Uh…. Right now."
"So you're just gonna skip over the whole ""deliberately targeted"" part?

Intentions matter."
"How many ""from the river to the sea"" signs are they holding?

That's literally a genocide slogan used by Hamas.

The PLO literally disavowed it in 93 before signing the Oslo Accords. So it's been a Hamas slogan longer than a lot of these protestors have been alive.

So either they're knowingly supporting Hamas' goals, or they're completely ignorant of the very thing they claim to support."
"People from Palestine just random bombed and slaughtered hundreds of innocent people from Israel. Full stop. 

Israel retaliated. They also gave notice. That is not genocide. It is retaliation for the murder of hundreds of their people. 

I would prefer no innocent people were slaughtered. However you cannot call retaliation with warning genocide."
What genocide?
"Agreed! In fact mankind originally came from Africa, so I'll meet you in Somalia."
I have seen them lol stop spreading misinformation
"Try being less distracted then.  You just wasted paragraphs of time being distracted, just like the people who have most power over this world want: focused on distractions and being divided against yourselves instead of being divided against them."
"""More than 500 rockets were fired from Gaza toward Israel in the recent barrage, according to the IDF, as of 6 a.m. local time Thursday. Of those, 154 were intercepted by Israeli missile defenses and 110 fell short, landing in Gaza.""

Your inability to do a simple Google search is pretty pathetic, Mr. Ghost"
"How so? The Gaza population has exploded since 2005.

Seems like an ineffective genocide"
"This is pretty bang on. I wish the Arab countries would actually help and support the Palestinians rather than fanning the flames of hatred for their own anti-Israeli/anti-western goals. Hamas is guilty for their sins, but it's not just Israel causing them to act like this. In fact believe it or not Israel does more to help the Palestinians than any other country in the region. It doesn't absolve Israel of their wrongs but I'm willing to bet they would prefer to not have Hamas as neighbours."
Daaaaaaaaaamn
"Hamas has been the defacto government of Palestine since 2005. There is little difference between support between the Palestinian state and Hamas. It's akin to trying to distinguish the difference between supporting China and the CCP.

"I call it when I see it.

You showed me a video of a bunch of Israelis celebrating Gaza becoming a cemetery, and I called it rightly terrible.

This is an article about about pro-palestinian demonstrations, so that's what I'm talking about.

Do you believe that every time one terrible thing happens, we should all collective denounce every other terrible thing that's happened? If so, I'm afraid we're going to be here a rather long while."
"You know it's funny, because I'm pretty sure every reasonable justice system has a threshold for ""murder"" - it requires intent.

So nice to know you disagree with literally centuries of legal scholarship."
Yes because Israël never killed Palestinian kids before.
"That just... That's just flagrantly wrong.

You are literally saying the means don't matter, only the ends. That logic leads directly to ""ends justify the means"" which is a horribly immoral way of viewing things.

You are going directly against one of the core principles of pretty much every modern justice system.

Why do you think most reasonable nations differentiate between things like manslaughter, and various degrees of murder?"
"We’re having entirely different conversations but that is okay. Every time conflict pops off in this region, I know - because I see and hear irl - more and more people finding space to hold the truth that it’s not Israeli lives or Palestinian lives. Lmfao, it’s the one time “all lives matter” is a good slogan."
"I mean Israel has killed over 2300 Palestinian civilians in the past week, is constantly bombing where civilians are (including hospitals), has cut off all food, water and electricity and isn’t allowing anyone (including civilians) to leave. 

Genocide also isn’t defined based on a percentage of the population killed. The definition is “the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group”. Currently, Israel is saying that their goal is to irradiate Hamas, not all Palestinians, but their actions do not exactly match. Im not sure if what they are doing can quite be called a genocide yet, but if they keep doing what they are doing, I wouldn’t be surprised if it is."
Just evacuate them North and South back and forth while bombing them
"You ignore relevant facts and call it ""whataboutism""

Killing civilians is wrong no matter who does it ,

Where is your outage against what the Israeli government is doing ?"
Do you approve of the IDF shoot-to-cripple policy? Do you approve of the policy of illegal settlements in the West Bank? Do you approve of arming the settlers? Do you approve of settlers blocking funeral parades I the West Bank and shooting at them? Do you approve the IDF dropping bombs on hospitals? Do you approve of the prime minister’s policy of propping up Hamas to undermine the secular movement in Palestine?
"I’ll answer you. 

No I don’t approve of what Hamas did. I have publicly said as much. 

I also don’t approve of what Israel is doing. I have also publicly said that. 

This is because I don’t believe that the killing of civilians is ever ok, regardless of who is doing it or who the civilians are. I have also publicly said that, more or less every time civilians are being killed since I’ve been an adult. 

Now, do you approve of what Hamas did? What about Israel? Do you always care about when civilians die or do you justify some deaths?"
They were psychologically torturing the people who live in downtown Ottawa. You’re insane if you think we should allow that.
"While the conveyers clearly hated the people in Centretown, I wouldn’t go so far as to say the conveyers “declared war” on them."
Supporting Palestinians is supporting terrorists?
"The Israeli government has been terrorizing Palestinians for decades. The bombings and killings the Israeli government have committed against Palestinians are grossly disproportionate to the bombings and killings committed by Palestinians against Israelis.

There is a lot of terrorism and evil on both sides, but Israeli is certainly better at inflicting terror."
"People naturally gravitate towards issues that are closer and more personal to them. This is true for the western world too. A crisis in a western country gets much more attention and sympathy than others such as the Ukrainian war. It's not a matter of condoning Hamas' actions for these protesters, but having a stronger reaction to Israel's response which will kill far more civilians."
"And it's still wrong to bomb innocent people and destroy their homes and kill women, children, doctors journalists. You can't condemn the murder of wome civilians then say it's fine to kill others."
">Now I know you've completely lost the plot. Hamas are the one who engaged in mass rape.

Are you seriously claiming IDF have not engaged in rape? I mean, it's not even just recent news. 

There's being an apologist and then there's denying reality. 

Listen, you can be upset and excuse one side all you want. Me personally? I'd rather both sides stop being absolute monsters. Lock BiBi and Haniyeh in a UFC cage with as many weapons as you'd like and let them pay the price of their stupidity for once."
They are targeting Hamas. Unfortunately Hamas hides amongst civilians.
"Yes, because you always provide advanced warning when you're going to deliberately target civilians.

BTW, it's not Israel that's currently blocking civilians from leaving the Gaza Strip, it's Hamas."
">So you’re just gonna skip over the whole “deliberately targeted” part?

No, because both groups have repeatedly and deliberately targeted civilians. I mean like, the IDF killed a Reuters journalist and a doctor just *yesterday*. So that cancels out."
">How many ""from the river to the sea"" signs are they holding?

Why don't you tell me? Count them for me..

I mean, I'm not at the rallies but in the dozens of videos I've watched so far, I actually haven't seen even one. I would think if they are as prevalent as you claim it shouldn't be hard to count them up.

I have seen

- this is not a celebration

- stop the massacre

- free Palestine

Listen, as far as I'm concerned Hamas and the IDF deserve each other. I just wish they'd stop taking so many innocents in the process."

Why are you saying “lol” about this?"
“According to IDF”
It's already been deemed a genocide.
"nobody wants HamAss or their supporters as neighbors

"The Gaza strip isn't all of Palestine? Like what? (Hamas is the government only in the occupied Gaza Strip, the rest of Palestine is disconnected and to the East)

And even if that was a correct thing you just said how can you not separate the people of a country and its government???? Like you're telling me whenever you see a Chinese person your first thought is, authoritarian communist??? Good god as Canadians we are truly guilty of some vile things then."

So the Jews in Damascus were murderous colonizers?
So what exactly is wrong about being pro-Palestine?
So Timothy McVeigh was not a murderer then...
"Nice circular argument.

Yes they have killed kids, just like literally every single government ever has during war time. 

Most of them were sadly killed due to being used as human shields. They would still be alive today if they weren’t, that’s the most important piece in this story."
"That's just... Not what I said.

We're not talking about manslaughter and the criminal justice system. We're talking about the death of civilians and children, and both sides have intentionally targeted them. Intent doesn't matter when it's a goddamn war crime."
"Yes I’m aware we are, because your response to my original comment had nothing to do with it.

Btw, do you denounce all the Arab countries that kicked Jews out from their native homes too? And that don’t let them in now? Just checking, I hardly ever hear about that side."
The Palestinian population has grown around 10x since Israel was founded. So I guess it has just been the least successful genocide in history.
"The one that just suffered the largest terror attack since 9/11?

The one that currently has hundreds more of its civilians being held hostage by an ISIS-like terror group?

The one that is currently under barrage by thousands of rockets every single day?

The one that is trying to eradicate a vicious Islamic Jihadist enemy but they keep hiding amongst kids and engaging in psychological warfare with the Israelis because they know they actually value human life unlike Hamas?

That one?"
"This is exactly what terrorism does.

It makes people look at ‘shoot-to-cripple’ in a Western lens because they know nothing about war-torn areas. Shoot-to-cripple is the humane way of dealing with terrorists, since terrorists use ‘shoot-to-kill’ at best, and ‘kidnap as a hostage’ at worst.

You don’t even understand which lens to view all of this in which is why your outrage is so misplaced."
"I think it's insane to take a public noise complaint and turn it into a war declaration. Besides that if you live next to the capital you should expect some protests, like that one senator said."
"a majority of the palestinias support Hamas. (Hence they would have won the elections - if the are ever held)

as such, supporting palestine is like supporting Canada.

As an analogy. Most Polls show Pierre Polievre and the conservatives winning the next elections. That says most Canadians support Pierre Polivre and his party."
Please post your links of Israels acts of terror over the last 10 years (and no this current war does not count Palestine asked for this one). Good luck finding the receipts.
"Israel is bombing military targets. HamAss makes a lot of thing military targets by hiding amongst civilians. Using residential neighborhoods to launch rockets. storing weapons in schools. putting their HQ under a hospital. According to the geneva conventions, these all become legitimate military targets thanks to HamAss.

If you want to blame someone, blame HamAss for doing this to their own populace.

do you see a difference between 

a murderer that sneaks into a house at night while everyone is sleeping and kills a baby

and the pediatric surgeon that cuts open the child to perform life saving open heart surgery, but the baby still dies.

both the murderer and the doctor killed a baby, right?   But there is a big difference, the doctor was not trying to kill a baby. the doctor didn't want to kill the baby, the doctor just wanted to remove the illness.

HamAss is the muderer. their intent was nothing but murder. their whole goal was just to kill the baby for no other reason than it was jewish. 

Israel's intent a is the destruction of a military target.  not a desire for wanton death. Why are people around Military targets, well that is a HamAss question.

so yes. I can condemnt the muder of women and children by Hamas, while also blaming HamAss (and not Israel) for intentionally putting their own people in the direct  line of fire."
">Are you seriously claiming IDF have not engaged in rape? I mean, it's not even just recent news. 

Then surely you can source the claim?

And maybe address the rest of my comment?"
">Yes, because you always provide advanced warning when you're going to deliberately target civilians.

What advanced warning did Shireen Abu Akleh get before the IDF shot and killed her? Or the Reuters journalist yesterday who they killed in Lebanon? “Hey, we are going to cut off all your water because we want revenge”. Is that honestly meant to be exculpatory? Why are you trying to justify targeting civilians?

>BTW, it's not Israel that's currently blocking civilians from leaving the Gaza Strip, it's Hamas.

Israel has opened up all the security checkpoints to let civilians leave Gaza? That’s a new development, do you have a link to a news article?"
"You might want to look up the definition of the word ""deliberate""."
Which was unintentional and is being investigated?
"I'm having a hard time finding good pictures of current protests, though I know I saw one in a recent article. But it remains a popular slogan. Here's a huge banner with it from a couple years ago:

https://images.app.goo.gl/BVNcJJG9euPxEk1P9

I'd link the article, but it's on BBC Pidgin for Nigeria it seems which is interesting to read.. anyways, this was in Chicago.

I'll edit if I'm able to find some from the current protests.

Edit:

Here you can see a sign saying ""occupation is a crime, resistance is a response"": https://images.app.goo.gl/oczENJXov69Yc7FB7

Which seems like a pretty direct way of equating Hamas' actions with legitimate resistance.

Nice big one on an overpass in Vancouver here: https://ca.news.yahoo.com/amphtml/canadian-palestinian-demonstrations-held-across-canada-middle-east-violence-131436431.html

""Resistance is not terrorism"" rings rather hollow given what Hamas has done: https://images.app.goo.gl/oDPHXTziYXyooYNx8

Here's an article about a protest in Vienna that was blocked because the invitations to it literally contained the slogan: https://www.reuters.com/world/from-river-sea-prompts-vienna-ban-pro-palestinian-protest-2023-10-11/"
"It will never be free as long as Hamas is there slaughtering innocent people from Israel at random whenever they feel like it knowing Israel will always retaliate to keep their citizens safe. Israel will never be safe as long as they have to worry about Hamas in Palestine.

This attack just continues to support a never ending violent cycle. We should not be celebrating these attacks waving flags."
"Because there were no 40 babies beheaded and confirmed, thats the misinformation 

Why is this so difficult for you?

Also why does beheading matter so much? Does the manner in which the baby dies make a difference? Do you prefer if the babies died in a rocket attack? Just trying to understand your train of thought"
"Whomever did so is an idiot that doesn't seem to understand what the word means.

Israel has also actively provided them with food, water and fuel."
"The rest of Palestine is under the Fatah authority and exists as an authoritarian state with repeated accounts of arbitrary arrest, torture and persecution similar to what is done by Hamas in the Gaza strip per Human Right Watch report.   
[https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/10/23/two-authorities-one-way-zero-dissent/arbitrary-arrest-and-torture-under](https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/10/23/two-authorities-one-way-zero-dissent/arbitrary-arrest-and-torture-under)  


The people of the country voted for Hamas, and the people in the area outside of Gaza support Fatah which is just as bad. 

When you support Palestine, you're supporting a terrorist organization that actively uses civilian casualty to soften the heart of westerners or an authoritarian regime that provides the slightly lesser of evil."
"it doesn't equal it, but Hamas enjoys a lot of support amongst the palestinians in general. So much so, that according to a poll by the palestinian center for policy survey and research  
  
The findings of the first quarter of 2023 indicate that the internal factional balance of power remains unchanged, with parity between Fatah and Hamas, if new parliamentary elections were to take place today, and a majority vote for Hamas’ candidate, Ismail Haniyyeh, over Mahmud Abbas in presidential elections

"which is irrelevant. 

If little timmy wasn't alive when the HST was implemented, should he not have to pay it because he didn't have the chance to vote for it?

I mean, he didn't even get a say in the legislation saying he doesn't get the right to vote because he is too young. 

sounds like Canada is oppressing their youth - or perhaps, People are bound by their governments decisions whether or not they voted for the party in power or agree with the government.

"Nothing.

But if you're pro Palestine and you actually understand the conflict, you should be *vehemently* against Hamas.

And that's why I take issue with people calling Hamas' actions a legitimate act of resistance, and why I find it incredibly suspect that in the days following the most devastating terrorist attack in Israel's history, there are suddenly rallies around the world touting solidarity with the Palestinian resistance movement."
The fact that first world educated Canadians are justifying killing of children (while at the same time condemning it) is...concerning.
"Intent doesn't matter but you feel the need to mention that it was done intentionally?

You realize you're sabotaging your own argument, right?

And no, Israel's air strikes don't intentionally target civilians, nor does Israel's official policies (unlike Hamas).

Also, you can't say ""bullshit"" to the statement that intent matters, then when I call you out for saying intent doesn't matter, respond with ""that's not what I said"" but also literally right after say ""intent doesn't matter"".

Like.. how much more can you contradict yourself?"
"That is the silliest logic ever. Yes, the Palestinian population has increased over the last 70 years. That doesn’t change the fact that in the past week, the Israeli government has killed over 2300 Palestinian civilians and counting."
So you don't care about innocent Palestinians'children dying ? Just to confirm.. ps great whataboutism in your reply
"I think you meant ""kidnap as hostage, then rape and torture before eventually killing anyway at worst""."
"They shoot to cripple unarmed teenagers. They shoot them in the groin so they can’t reproduce. They shoot them for attending funerals. So, humane.


See, you don’t condemn it."
"A ""majority"" means over 50% and they won 47% of the vote 20 years ago. Nowadays, the median age is 18 with over 40% under 14. A larger percentage of people were not voting age during that last election. It is not the excuse to cast them all as terrorists that you think it is. 

You also completely ignore foreign support and the lengths that the Israeli government has gone through to keep Hamas powerful in order to prevent unification of the two Palestinian regions. ""Hamas is an asset"" is the line that gets shared a lot because of their direct quotes from the current government 

https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/

These comments always bother me because in our own colonization history, a handful indigenous people would ""strike back"" on a settler community in bad faith and it was used as justification to decimate indigenous populations. That is obviously my own indigenous bias, but your ethnicity doesn't make you inherently evil, it's the cycle of violence that does."
Did you know that the most advanced military in the middle east doesn't actually have to bomb thousands of innocent people to death? Your analogy would be more accurate if the doctor killed a few hundred kids trying to cure one kids sickness. And you'd rightfully call that doctor a murderer and a monster.
They won’t
">which was unintentional

Maybe I’d be willing to believe that if the IDF hadn’t been known to target journalists (like Shireen Abu Akleh) and doctors (like Tarek Loubani). Given that, stop trying to lie to me and say they don’t target civilians when it’s convenient for them to do so. And, given that you are trying to justify the targeting of civilians, you should stop pretending you have a sincere problem with Hamas targeting civilians."
"Please do. I'm absolutely certain there are a few out there because there are idiots in every protest however you made it very much seem like these were everywhere which is not the case.

The Poland protest had them chanting it which is disgusting but so far here it genuinely seems to be more about supporting the people of Gaza and stopping the IDF from using this as yet another reason to go hunting for sport."
Israel will never be safe as long as they perpetuate apartheid
I think you are mixing me up with someone else. I said they were killed and I don’t care how because they are babies
Not true.
">authoritarian state

>people of the country voted for

Now how is a state both authoritarian and voted for by the people? 

When you support Palestine you support disenfranchised people who have been victimized by a western funded regime for years on end. A correlation to all this suffering is the group Hamas which is a subsection of the Palestinian people but not the entirety of them. Sure the Palestinian authorities might not be in the right but that's not what people are saying, they are saying neither is the Israeli government with its response.

In a surprising twist it's the people in charge who are causing a bunch of issues for the sake of their own egos and are using civilian lives as collateral, truly this is the most shocking revelation ever. The correct answer is I support Israel and Palestine with a two state solution that comes about peacefully from deescalation, anything else is the opinion of a radical."
"I mean yeah have you seen Star Wars? People always pick the terrorist freedom rebels over the authoritarian empire regime, that's human nature. No one likes to be subjected to genocide, forced relocation, chemical attacks... ect

That's why as long as the Israeli government tries to fight fire with even bigger fire they are also guilty of continuing the issues. What they should do is descalate and surrender the contested territory that isn't there's and call for the two state deal. Then if Hamas does continue to cause issues you can call on UN anti terrorist assistance (or uncle sam would probably come running) if it's beyond local law enforcement and military."
"You’re right, 40% of Gaza who are under 15 should’ve just overthrown the government while learning how to read and write"
"Oh one is definitely worse than the other, no disputing that. But writing off children as ""collateral damage"" because a terrorist organization is hiding amongst them screams of skipping past all the previous steps and moving right to the final solution."
No doubt you believe that Israel should just disappear.
I don't think even Hamas would disagree with Pollievre.
He's absolutely correct. That was their intention since they started their attacks on Oct 7.
"What a load of BS. 

Hamas is a peaceful organization. They are freedom murderers, freedom rapists and freedom butchers."
"Let's make sure we tighten the pathways to this country so we don't have to deal with Islamic extremism here at home.

With everything going on regarding immigration, refugee/asylum program, temporary foreign workers, international students, and so forth this is the last thing we fucking need."
No lies detected
I like how the people calling for a ceasefire would never forgive you if you did even the slightest thing wrong to them.  Meanwhile Israel is supposed to find peace when these devils sent their version of special forces over to kill women and children.
"I hate this, because he's such a giant douche, but shit I agree with him."
Hamas is a death cult.
Voting for this guy
Trudeau can't wait to open up our borders to Palestinian refugees like he did to Syrians. He wants to his legacy to be the 'diversity' and 'woke' PM.
An accurate statement
"Everyone agrees with this, including Hamas. Everyone except Hamas's supporters on the left and at these protests."
"As a conservative who is against this war, I find the political fervor unsettling at the moment...."
He is correct
Glad he’s willing to say the truth out loud.
"One thing really surprises me is how so many people refuse to criticize Hamas. I wouldn’t call anyone an anti-Semite if they gave good-faith criticisms of Israeli actions and policies but you can’t just let Hamas off the hook completely. 

Pretending Hamas isn’t a death cult is absolutely moronic, though."
He's right. They've outright admitted it
i mean yeah. no shit. hamas says as much.
"That's just the truth. If there was a button Hamas could press to kill every Israeli/Jew in exchange for killing every Palestinian, I'm sure they would slam it with no hesitation. We've seen the rocket firing infrastructure hidden inside schools and hospitals. More Palestinian deaths are just getting them more sympathy and more recruits which is entirely what they want."
He's not wrong. This has been obvious for a while.
"Again, he states the truth.  I'm shocked."
"Israel has the right to exist and right to defend but Hamas is a reaction to Israel’s tactic to control Palestinians lives, occupy land, and stymie Palestinian statehood. It has just become radical and a terrorist organization due to their “maximum damage” ideology to deal with the military/power asymmetry.

 Unlike the indigenous populations that had no old world empathy, Israel will continue to have these threats all over the world, from time to time, depending on how social media, academics, money, and world support/power shifts. 

Even justified bloodshed leaves a footprint that can come back to haunt you."
He is my PRIME MINISTER.
"Naw, Hamas stated their goal was to wipe out Israel, I’m pretty sure they aren’t lying about that. People don’t just lie about that and then start murdering people towards their objective."
Doesn't he not have security clearance?
"I wouldn't say maximise, what I gather from my Palestinian friends is that they don't care how many civillians die as long as their goals are achieved."
"Damn, as opposed to Poilievre and the bloodthirsty lunatics on this sub, who just want to maximize Palestinian deaths."
Even a village idiot like Pierre understands this.
A maestro of the obvious.
When’s the federal election? Time for this guy to be the PM
PM Poilievre can't come soon enough...
"And, unfortunately, Israeli has been happy to prove the Palestinian part"

"I just wish he could agree that Israel is an unnecessarily aggressive actor, while condemning HAMAS as the answer to the Palestinian liberation movement and also focusing on strengthening Canada's immigration system against extremist actors. 

All we need is some sort of solidarity against Netanyahu while advocating for the freedom and safety of Israeli's (and Palestinians) from pointless and undue violence caused by their fanatical governments."
And Israel determined to accommodate them.
"Ahh yes, Islamophobia in the comments.

I mean last time a race was prosecuted and systematically killed, we turn away ships of their refugees/ones that escaped. Guess we are going to do it again! 

Canada never disappoints.

We will just give a apology in 50 years over their dead bodies. And maybe give government employees a holiday.

Edit: thank you Canadians, as the replies to this comment and the downvotes. 
You have shown not all humans are equal.

People from some religions are less equal than other religions. Just because a child is born in a certain part of the world they are not the babies/children we care about.

I think we have a charter of rights or something but who cares right ?"

It’s also been officially unofficial Israel government policy to prop up Hamas over alternative Palestinian government because their extremism would justify official Israel government actions against Palestinians. Government officials are on tape explaining this strategy.
"No shit, Captain obvious. Good thing we have Skippy Crypto to tell us the sky is blue and bears shit in the woods."

"Most powerless statement ever. Nobody is denying this fact. But of course, he's just using it to bolster the ""everyone who defends Palestine is part of Hamas"" nonsense narrative conservatives push."
"PP is a fucking idiot and shows his lack of understanding in world conflict AGAIN. Just because Hamas intends to use human shields doesn't make it ok to kill the fucking human shield.

 Jesus fuck, this guy is going to be a terrible PM when HIS cult votes him up."
Both sides are trash……kind of like Canadian politics right now…..hmm
No shit PP. Now let's you say anything moral about calling for a ceasefire or lamenting the death of thousands of Palestinian children in response or criticizing Israel for withholding food and water aid to civilians. Then we'd know you have a spine.
"Seems like it's Israel doing that, but believe whatever you want. Hamas would if they could, but Israel is the one actually dropping bombs on civilians. Sorry if that fact conflicts with the narrative that everyone on this sub is so eager to believe."
"Israeli politicians have actively been calling for genocide. So, no thanks Peepeee."
"IF that's the case, the sure are doing an awful job by keeping hostages alive."
No shit Sherlock
"It's absurd tho to criticize deaths before asking for a ceasefire. If he were to ask for a ceasefire then I could understand... But without it, this is an absurd break from reality and history.

Even in this thread it seems like so many people think this conflict started on Oct 7 in a vacuum."
The IDF is the closest since we've seen to a purely evil military force since the Wermacht.
"I'm not trying to defend Hamas here, but this is demonstrably not true. If this were true they wouldn't be holding onto hostages. Hamas could kill every hostage and leave their bodies underground, or dump them in the surface. Hell, they wouldn't have taken hostages in the first place. Instead, according to the two hostages released, they've brought in doctors to provide regular checkups, given them sanitary conditions that are routinely cleaned and eat the same food as their captors.

The deaths of hostages are almost entirely the result of Israeli bombing of Gaza. This isn't even in dispute. The IDF accepts it and instead says that all deaths are the fault of Hamas, regardless of how the deaths happen. This line of reasoning isn't even accepted in Israel and especially not by the families of the hostages who are [currently protesting for the safe release of their friends and family members](https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/18/world/netanyahu-hamas-hostages-israel/index.html). They're asking for Netanyahu to prioritize the safe release of their loved ones over revenge and retaliation and that bozo won't even meet with them.

If Hamas is as evil as we think they are we really don't need to lie, distort or give ourselves over to hyperbole. It's bad enough that they've kidnapped 240 people."
So why are we supporting Israel in aiding Hamas' goals?
[deleted]
"Does Polly think the IDF are a branch of Hamas?

Because it's the IDF that has killed over 12,000 people. 

You don't get to ""look what you made me do"" with the deaths and thousands and thousands of people. Not unless you're like the most evil psychopath in the world."
Replace Hamas with the IDF and the genocidal Israeli apartheid state and Lil PP might have some relevance.
It's Orwellian to say that the people being bombed are trying to maximize the deaths from the bombing.
"And Israel is maximizing the death toll of Palestinians considering 11 000 Palestinians got murdered in less than a month. Hamas is a reaction to the 75 years brutal occupation, genocide and apartheid of Israel."
"I'd disagree? They need to maximize visibility, total count is secondary."
"Just a reminder that the longer this war drags on, the longer Netanyahu can postpone answering to the 2019 charges of breach of trust, accepting bribes and fraud."
This isn’t Canadian news gtfo

Didn't they openly state it some time ago?
The leaders openly praise sacrificing their own people. Death cult.

"It's the double standard in the comments that's notable here. If Trudeau said the same thing the top responses would be some variation of ""yeah no shit, what does this statement accomplish?, what about cost of living?"" etc.

Both this remark and the one Trudeau said can both be simultaneously true. The main difference is that Polievre is vaguely leading the listener to an morally grey conclusion without committing to a specific action. That way if the outcome backfires or produces unforeseen consequences Polievre can feign innocence. Where as the context to Trudeau's initial statement is that if the situation in Gaza is permitted to continue Israel can eventually annex the whole area to their discretion. Hamas being evil is breaking news to no one."
Yes please. Look what happened to Egypt and Jordan when they let them in. We don’t want that here extremist should have no safe haven.
Could NOT agree more.
"Germany is doing something where you have to declare the right of Israel to exist and declare support for the state of Israel to be accepted as an immigrant (or it's a proposal for it to be added). We can do something similar to combat the anti-semitism.

Mind you, we don't need to ban criticism of what the Israeli government does but atleast Israel's right to exist is a good litmus test for anti-semite extremists."
"Add deportations to this. No reason to keep so many terrorist supporters here. We tried Trudeau's 'post-national state's and it turns out it just means a lot more stinky terrorists here, so nah."
I hope we do the same thing for Gazan refugees that we did for Syrian refugees during the start of Trudeau's PM tenure.
Calm down there Grand Dragon! We get it you're white.
You wish.
"Well the issue is the conflation of Hamas and Palestinians. Israel has more than every right to hunt and kill Hamas, they’re a terrorist organization, but the IDF has demonstrated over the course of the war an extraordinary tolerance for the loss of innocent Palestinian life in that goal of eliminating Hamas. 

The IDF has modern weaponry if they wanted they could be more precise in their attacks."
They call for a ceasefire but never ask for Hamas removal of power or freeing of hostages.
The little kids getting bombed sure don’t look like devils to me
"I mean, this is a pretty obvious statement."
Someone pointed out the other day that the Left is pushing so many liberals to support the conservatives. Trudeau needs to change his tune asap before his party stands no chance next year

"He may be a douche, but [maybe nobody is a douche 100% of the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdChJwDKFmI)"
Left leaning people can’t adopt the right-wing norm of only existing to be reactionary. Your political opponents will be correct some of the time.
He's saying the most obvious thing ever. What he could've said to show he has a spine is that Israel should stop killing thousands of Palestinian children.
"i'm surprised harper, who allows foreign criminals into canada, isn't telling poilievre to allow hamas in."
Had there even been any real news stories or even anecdotal stories of Syrian refugees causing problems in Canada?
I hope he does accept refugees. We accepted an 'unlimited amount' of Ukrainians.
"Not only is it making it unpleasant to even be on reddit, but I would be lying if the level of hysteria this last while didn't push me towards understanding the Palestinian side. Like it's one thing to recognise Israel as having the right to defend against Hamas, but it's like people act like Israel can do no wrong and can receive no criticism, while I regularly have been seeing some of the most devastating news every day coming out of Gaza. And a lot of the rhetoric is so downright scary, banning protest, deporting citizens, advocating outright acts of genocide, saying kids deserve it because they would grow up to be terrorists (I guess pre-crime is a thing now) - I just can't believe it. And someone will pop in and say my understanding of geopolitics and history is pathetic now I am sure lol. But like, is this rhetoric what those Palestinians have to deal with on top of everything else? 

It is uncomfortable flashbacks to post 9/11 tbh, I would have thought we would have learned the whole with us or against us mentality leads down a bad road. And I have a bad feeling that we are on that road. Even during the war on terror I feel like people were more levelheaded about calling out their own 'side'."
Palestinians wanted jews dead long before a Jewish state. How is hamas a reaction to control? Obviously if you omit all the instances of terror attacks before gaza was barricaded you would come to such a conclusion but you don't know what you're talking about right? You don't live in Israel to know. Palestinians had every chance to prosper but sadly they chose the jihad path
"I don't think Israel has the right to be a religious ethno-state the same as I think Iran doesn't have a right to be an Islamic sharic state, or that the US has a right to be a fundamentalist evangelical state.


Religious states are bad, and ethno states are bad.




States with strong rights and strong protections for minorities are good, and we should feel bad and fix it that minorities think they need to hurt people to feel safe"
"The amazing thing about progressives is how they twist words and meaning depending on who's speaking them and where they are on their ""marginalized"" totem pole. Progressives see the Palestinians and Hamas as the ""oppressed"" so they can come out and say they want to exterminate Jews and progressives will be like ""well you see what they really mean is that economically blah blah blah...."" and then when someone at the top of their ""marginalized totem pole"" comes out and says ""we need to protect our borders from people who want to kill us"" they'll go ""well what they actually mean is that they want to exterminate that population and commit genocide."" It really is a fascinating combination of virtue and delusion at the highest level."
By choice
He does have security clearance just not top secret
Don't you not have a point?
"One of their goals being ""make Israel look bad to western observers"", and that is best done by ensuring maximum civilian casualties they can blame on Israel. Even when it's their own rockets.

Before the IDF secured evacuation corridors, Hamas tried to blow up the road and shot at people fleeing, then tried to blame it on an Israeli airstrike. Since the corridor has been secured, the IDF has had to protect it from Hamas.

They are actively trying to get Palestinians killed. Their charter literally views it as every Palestinian's duty to be a martyr."
"Its an astroturfing campaign. Google ""act.il"""
Don’t know why this is downvoted. Pierre is a fucking moron.
"Then why did they open the humanitarian corridor? They have a happy trigger finger sure, but after watching what Russia and Assad do to enemy cities there is an effort the avoid."
">Cowardly statement. Pretending Israel has no agency in the situation whatsoever when an overwhelming majority of Palestinians who've died thus far are civilians.

Hamas controlled ministry of health counts killed Hamas fighters as civilians but its true there are still significant civilian deaths. Can't be helped when one side uses human shields of its own people. What would you have Israel do? Let them get away with it? That just empowers terrorists to do what Hamas is doing, it also empowers other sus militaries to build military infrastructure next to or under civilian infrastructure. Let me tell you now, if what happened to Israel happened to America or any other nation and the adversary also used human shields, America would still bomb the fuck out of them.

Think of it this way, if a gunman went in and shot up your neighborhood and killing friends and family, threatens to do it again and then uses his own child as a human shield while shooting at you, what would you do? Let him get away to kill the rest of your neighborhood? Not shoot? Call for a ceasefire so he gets away, threatening to do the same thing as many times as he can? He's still shooting at you by the way and he started his shooting spree under the previous ceasefire. What would you do? Anyone who cares about  his friends and family will do what Israel is doing."

Sensible Israelis took to the streets for months protesting Netanyahu's shifty constitutional changes to their supreme courts. His gov't has some questionable members with abhorrent backgrounds. He would probably be doing prison time in a just world for his own past exploits.
That would be too nuance for Pierre. Everything he says or does is for some culture war soundbite.
That’s like… really antisemantics man….
Israel is playing right into Hamas' hand with their actions.

"I'm not a big fan of Islam either, personally, keep your religious beliefs to yourself and there won't be any problems, but everyone has to use their religion as a platform for hate and culture wars. Most people don't care what pretty much anyone does or believes, it's just keeps getting shoved in our faces. As an athiest, I have no time for silly nonsense.

Fighting over which religion is the one true religion is what started all this literal racism."

">The problem is when their bombs are hitting civilians and children at a 100/1 ratio

According to Hamas. Why on Earth would a terrorist organization tell the truth? Why on Earth would you believe them?

They were caught red-handed lying about the ""500"" people killed in the hospital where a PIJ rocket misfired and burned out some cars.

So that's literally just one example where ""500 civilian casualties from the IDF"" was determined, by multiple independent countries' intelligence, to be ""0 civilian casualties from the IDF.""

That single, entirely false incident accounted for about 10% of their claimed civilian casualties at the time.

Does that mean there aren't civilian casualties? Obviously not. But it's also unbelievably foolish to believe their numbers, and especially their ratio of combatants to non-combatants, since the propaganda war is the only one they have a chance at succeeding in, and they've been caught red-handed ascribing 500 civilian deaths to an incident that didn't even involve the IDF in any way."
"These regulations assume that the other side is following regulations as well.  You're not supposed to attack a building with a red cross on it, for example, but that doesn't protect the building if the other side isn't following the rules on what buildings can have a red cross on them.  Similarly, something is not a ""civilian object"" when the other side is using it for combat purposes."
"Ahhh yes, a redditor with zero post history and a comment history barely dating back a year. Totally trustworthy.

EDIT:  As expected, all of their comments over the month since the Oct 7 masscare are entirely pushing anti-Israel messaging.

Bot or not? You decide!"
To maximize your own civilian deaths as well as the enemies?
"So you option is what then, acquiesce to terrorists?"
Can't call for a ceasefire when Hamas has stated repeatedly that they won't stop.
"If the numbers of civilian casualties determines whose evil and whose good in a conflict then that means Germany and Russia are the true heroes of WW2 and the allies are evil.

North America saw pretty much zero civilian casualties in both world wars. We are the greatest evil of all time."
Gaza is lucky they weren't nuked
"100% this conflict is good for both sets of people murdering innocent civilians! Hamas benefits because it builds support off of the back of the Israeli response and Likud benefits because their existence as a political party hinges on the threat of Hamas.

First part is true 2nd part is a lie. Just recognition of Israel as a nation. And it won’t pass the government it’s more symbolic

"If we drew the real Venn diagram of Hamas and the Palestinians they're almost completely overlapping. White people like to see themselves as the great saviours, that's just not the case. If anything, Oct 7th increased Hamas popularity in Gaza. Hamas has demonstrated they're greatest weapon is to hide behind women and children when they fight. There is no way to be more precise with cowards like that."
"Exactly, Hamas gets completely let off the hook and the hostages are all but forgotten. It gives you a little insight into how fake their bs morality claims really are."
"Serious questions, as someone with both Israeli and Canadian citizenships:

1. What do you think Israel should do? Seriously. How can Israel fight this war without bombing children?

2. If you don't think Israel should attack at all, how do you want them to get back their hostages - or prevent this from happening again, either by Hamas, or, far more dangerously, by Hezbollah?

3. Have you looked at how many civilians were killed by NATO forces (including Canadian soldiers) in Afghanistan?"
Yeah the people forcing them to stay to act as cover certainly are. The same people who shoot rockets out of hospitals and schools.
This is where I sit. I really don’t want to vote for CPC and so refuse to not vote at all. CPC will make some problems worse but immigration/asylum seekers/int students and tfws need a big overhaul in policy and the liberals and ndp will never do it. Not sure what to do all options suck.

You are pouring sugar on Israeli actions. And pouring vinegar on everything else. It's literally been 70 years of occupation and apartheid.
"Israel is a democracy, with liberal laws, not Talmudic Laws. You’re allowed to practice any religion and there isn’t any law that will punish you for doing that. 

They just want to have a majority Jewish population where they feel safe, most of them are secular."
There’s a heck of a lot more Muslims and Arabs in Israel than there are Jews in their neighbouring countries. Funny how inept they are at this theocratic ethnostate thing everyone keeps parroting
"Palestinians in Gaza are stateless refugees/descendants driven out of their generational lands in what is now Israel during the Nakba in 1948 by Israel to create Israel as a Jewish majority state in the image of zionism. These are the same people Israel is bombing now. 

No amount of word salad in your post could make the people who cleansed and stole a land based on ethnic entitlements and rendered its original inhabitants as refugees who they are now bombing en masse as the victims or the oppressed group. This is not a ""progressive"" issue. That's like saying opposing the South African apartheid or Nazi Germany was a ""progressive"" issue."

"Yeah, I don't believe that. It sounds straight out of a propoganda machine. Israel do everything right. Hamas do everything wrong.

I know people in Gaza and that's not even close to what they say. The only thing they hate more than Hamas is Israel."
"I dont think so dude. I genuinely think this reflects the views of most Canadians, particularly conservative Canadians - wh have never NOT supported a massacre of brown people."
"Intense pressure from the rest of the world. They literally blocked all food, water and fuel for weeks and called the Palestinians animals. They bombed the humanitarian corridor numerous times despite Egypt asking them to stop and they bombed evacuation convoys and theatened to bomb aid trucks at one point. It's only after intense pressure, that they gave in a bit. They don't get a award for doing what they should have done in the first place. Even Russia did not cut off food and water to hundreds of thousands of civilians. That's insane and it's wild that media gave it so little coverage. If it was Russia you'd have talking heads talk about the genocide of Ukraine everyday for weeks.

Even today the UN just announced they had to stop food and water delivery because of the lack of fuel which is again because of Israel blocking it."
If a gunman is holding kids hostage in a classroom do we just bomb the school?
"You can't be a terrorist and not a civilian, really.

We'd need to describe hamas differently to not count them as civilians.

"Ah yes, all those warnings have worked SO WELL.

14,000+ dead innocent civilians. Just so well.

You realize Israel kinda cares about the optics of this, right? There’s a reason they are pushing the narrative of this being justified when it’s clearly not. They couldn’t just commit an open genocide and get away with it, and they know that. That’s why all the bullshit that’s been disproven again and again. That’s why they do those token “roof knocks” and flyers, so that rubes like you will fall for it and excuse the genocide. Yet, they have no real effect in reality. Most people in Gaza are not gonna get those flyers being dropped when they’re hiding from airstrikes. Use your head a little, ffs."
"If Israel admitted the wanted to genocide Palestinians (which significant parts of their ruling government all but have), and acted on that, they’d lose the western financial and military support that they critically rely on.  

They are pushing things as far as they think the US and the like can tolerate in their ultimate goal of a single Israeli stage covering the entirety of the Mandate."
">  Israel does roof knocks

... on residential buildings, schools, libraries, hospitals, etc.

Did you know that those ""roof knocks"" can also be fatal to inhabitants?"
Israel did not warn the refugee camp they massacred killing over 100 people.
"The knocks aren't happening currently

But also, if somebody called you saying they're about to bomb your house, what's your recourse?

The obvious things is that they're wrong to bomb your house and that they shouldn't bomb your house


How much would you use Israel for destroying all of your belongings and priceless mementos? I dunno, your first child's ashes?"
"Okay.. but the fact that the western world sees these “roof knocks” and warnings of incoming bombings is fucking INSANE. That is not Israel being generous and kind, they’re still bombing the hell out of innocent people. If someone called up your house and warned you they were going to violently break in around 6pm, would you thank them for their generous warning and leave your house for them to do that?"
"The UN is a joke and has decayed so poorly that anyone who actually follows it knows better than to take what they say seriously.  It was never intended to be any more than a forum and not some moral arbiter of justice.

For example just this past October 30th they appointed Iran as the CHAIR of their new human rights councils. What a joke!  

And then these past weeks Iran has started executing women for not following sharia law because they know they have control of the UN’s human rights council and so of course not a peep form the “UN”.  Not to even get into the councils on the Middle East that are repeatedly formed that always exclude Israel so the nations who call for Jewish eradication get a platform to condemn Israel in headlines while Israel gets all of two minutes to respond.

It goes on and on, but anyone touting the UN as some moral compass or anything more than an editorial opinion at best just proves they don’t follow the UN or have any clue what they’re talking about.

Huge red flag that said person is not fit to comment intelligently in the topic frankly."

"Lol what are you talking about?  

Hamas has said as much themselves and the culture has long celebrated the deaths of martyrs.  Why do you think for decades now the problem of Hamas (and other Islamic extremism groups) using their people as cannon fodder has continued?  

Because it is effective to propagandize their deaths, same thing has happened in many other conflicts and if you know anything about life in Palestine you would know that dying as martyr is not a bad thing, parents literally wish it for their children and hand out sweets when it happens.  It’s so common children literally play a game where they take turns being the martyr and carrying one child pretending they’re dead.

I’m no fan of PP and a life long lefty, but what he’s saying is blatantly obvious to anyone who has paid attention to this conflict over the decades."

"You do realize murder refers to a person who dies in the pursuit of Justice or because of injustice.

What they are quite literally saying is they are proud to be survivors of Injustice.

A martyr is literally anyone who gets killed in the service of Justice or because of Injustice. Almost all of the people he is referring to are civilians who were killed by Israeli state.

There is cultural context here you need to be much more aware of if you're going to be talking about this shit."
"The notion that people don't care about whether Polievre can address the rising cost of living is absurd. One of the main argument for voting conservative is that the Liberals are causing a cost of living crisis, the implication being that the tories can solve the issue.

"Do you actually have any evidence for that or are going off vibes? I’m sure a plurality, possibly a majority, are sympathetic to Hamas but that doesn’t make them themselves terrorists. Just like even though much of the Israeli population is sympathetic to Israel and the IDF that doesn’t make them justified targets or acceptable civilian casualties for antagonism against the Israeli state"
Even when they got elected in Gaza as I recall Hamas weren't quite at 50%. Recent polling of both Gaza and West Bank shows that there's not really close to majority support for either Hamas or Fatah. Not that civilian deaths are acceptable regardless but I don't think it's fair to imply they're expendable because they're all Hamas.
"1. Give Palestinians a meaningful way to address their concerns non violently

Like, Indigenous people in Canada have similar struggles. But they are also can do stuff like peacefully block railroads without getting shot if they are truly unhappy. 

Ideally also through less disruptive protests or even boring political activism - not actually praising Canada here. My point is more that clearing the low bar of not using lethal force against peaceful civil disobedience means that the kind of person who’d blow up the railroad instead of sitting on it can’t get traction or support.

Winning that baseline agreement against violence has trade offs - like, there are areas where indigenous ownership and sovereignty has significantly more legal weight than Palestinians have. But is a viable tactic against terrorism 

2. If you don’t want this to happen again, and you don’t want a viable two state solution or single state like Canada, then the only solution is genocide IMO. Like, only bombing some children while leaving the rest to grow up in tragedy is just going to create another generation of terrorists.

3. Yep, Canada is far from perfect. IMO stuff like the Residential School Starvation Experiments is a better way to call out that our shit stinks though"

"Calling Israel a democracy with “liberal laws” is such a stretch it’s pretty much just false. There are many examples of their regressive attitudes and forcing religious rules, to name a few:

"Don't believe what?

Rockets failing and falling on Gaza is a long standing issue. You can find plenty of credible outlets reporting an estimated 10% of rockets falling in Gaza. That famous ""500 dead in hospital strike"" famously was actually a case of ""pij rocket lands in hospital parking lot, killing dozens"".

There was plenty of evidence showing that the alleged strike on the road before the IDF secured the corridor couldn't have been an Israeli strike. There are apparently videos of Gazans going around showing bodies with bullethole in their heads, from *before* the IDF got there.

The success of the IDF-secured corridor has been *widely* reported, literally hundreds of thousands have been evacuated."
"Nah, this isn't a right/left thing.

Then there are the white nationalists who are stoking the fire from both sides. They are jerking off watching jews and muslims fight each other. Both things they hate.

">If a gunman is holding kids hostage in a classroom do we just bomb the school?

That's the thing.

If there was an hostage situation in Tel Aviv, Israel's force wouldn't bomb an entire neighborhood to get rid of an enemy squad.

&#x200B;

The Americans and the coalition allies led a bloody battle to recapture Baghdad. They suffered lots of casualties, it was costly in civilian lives, but it was nowhere this as bad.

&#x200B;

And when people were evacuated, strangely, they were allowed to return to their homes after the conflict.  Something the Palestinians will never get to experience.

&#x200B;

Anyway.  Saying Hamas seeks to maximize the number of deaths on both sides... I don't know? It's like saying water is wet?  The sun is warm?

His own kids hostage and he is threatening to kill the rest of the kids in the school. Yes, bomb the room he is with his kids. Protect the rest of the school. Why, will you let him get away and continue to shoot the rest of the kids just because he is using his own kid as a hostage?"
"A gunman is not the same as a force that governs the region and has support from the majority of the population.  It’s why there competent different rules for engagement for different scenarios, because they don’t transfer over like you imply,

Weak attempt at a parallel that shows you have not done the work to understand this conflict and what is at play."
Yeah but Hamas controlled ministry of Gaza counts Hamas on it's civilian counts. I'm pretty sure terrorists don't count as civilians bro.
"> 14,000+ dead innocent civilians. Just so well.

The numbers come from the Hamas controlled Gaza health ministry that counts terrorists as civilians but yes, dead civilians always sucks. Now a question for you, if Israel did not do all these things and actually indiscriminately bombed Gaza, what would the death toll be? 

> They couldn’t just commit an open genocide and get away with it

Yeah sure, which is why their genocide is sooo effective. Doubling Gaza's population in 18 years since 2005. Great genocide. Might as well be as effective as waiting for them to die of old age!

>  Yet, they have no real effect in reality.
Kind of like Israel's genocide.

> Most people in Gaza are not gonna get those flyers being dropped when they’re hiding from airstrikes. Use your head a little, ffs.

Okay but they get the roof knocks right? Use your head. Israel can only do so much when Hamas builds under, inside or near civilian infrastructure."
"No, he's right. If Israel wanted to genocide the people of Gaza, they could and would.

Let's not forget that hamas started *this* particular situation. (yes, yes, it goes back centuries, neither are particularly blameless). Israel wasn't the one that attacked first, here."
"You are so close to the point yet you miss it.  


You are absolutely right that Israel is concerned with the optics of it. Dead Palestinians are bad press for Israel.  


That is exactly why Israel tries to minimize casualties.   


>14,000+ dead innocent civilians

I understand this is a big number, but what you are doing here is like looking at the death toll of flu, and declaring flu to be the new black death.  


Israel struck Gaza over 20,000 times since October 7. Vast majority of Israeli strikes kill nobody. They are doing their best to minimize casualties. If you think you can do a better job, you are welcome to tell us your ideas. But you cannot do that, because you don't know shit about how militaries function."
"You’re comment made it so evident how ignorant you are on this topic and your biases in your delivery and the narratives you weave exposed even more.

Very obvious you haven’t put in work to understand this conflict but just enjoy being loud and confidently ignorant grandstanding with big words."
I think it's up to 50 gazillion civilians now. Hamas math.
"> If Israel admitted the wanted to genocide Palestinians (which significant parts of their ruling government all but have), and acted on that, they’d lose the western financial and military support that they critically rely on.


Israel did not have US support before the 1970s and they defended just fine against multiple multi-Arab coalitions targeted at destroying them. More innocents in Israel might due lacking funding for things such as the iron dome but Israel is not a powerless country.

> They are pushing things as far as they think the US and the like can tolerate in their ultimate goal of a single Israeli stage covering the entirety of the Mandate.

Funny because I wonder what ""From the River to the Sea"" means that Palestinian supporters oh so love to chant. If pushing things as far as they can is doubling Gaza's population in 18 years they might as well not push! LOL"
"They would not.

They'd lose US government support, but colonialism is still popular with the rich and powerful.


Canada still does plenty of it with mines in south america"
Sure it can but most of the time it's an effective warning?
"A sad thing that terrorists (Hamas) are hiding among refugees, otherwise there would be no reason to bomb that camp. This was a case where they had a target to kill instead of infrastructure.

Israel does not always warn but it does give warnings when it can. If they had given a warning here, the target would have escaped."
"> The knocks aren't happening currently

Source on that? I don't believe Israel has stopped this policy when attacking infrastructure.

And more like, the blame should fall on the terrorists for placing themselves and their bases in the middle of civilian infrastructure"
They can blame Hamas who is building military infrastructure under their civilian infrastructure. Rather there be a roof knock than just outright bombing. The bombing will happen regardless because that's what happens when Hamas commits war crimes and uses human shields/builds near civilian infrastructure
100% and they are made up of a strong arab coalition who hate Israel and are constantly accusing it of war crimes while ignoring terrorist groups like hamas and hezbolloh.

">Let's just go with what the UN says is happening there. 2.5 million people with no food, water or any medical treatment.

Let's take this at face value.  


The human body is typically estimated to last \~3 days without water. We're about \~41 days into this war. They'd all be dead by now.   


Where are the millions of bodies you would expect at this point?"
"Sorry for accusing you of that, then. I figured it wouldn't be getting many eyeballs buried this deep in the comments.

I'm not going to pretend that *any* number of civilian deaths is morally a good thing. I don't believe that. War is never a morally good thing. Show me a war that has ever been anything but a humanitarian tragedy.

I was objecting to your characterization of a 100-to-1 casualty ratio, which has no basis in fact.

I don't think what is happening to the Palestinian people is a good thing. I do, however, think that there are some things that are fundamentally mischaracterized regarding Israel's approach.

Israel reports dropping 20,000 bombs. By all accounts, they're killing less than 1 person per *guided* bomb - does this not show that they've focused on Hamas targets. buildings and infrastructure rather than civilians? If they truly did not care for (or desired) civilian casualties, would this ratio not be completely different? We know for a fact that a single one of those bombs can easily kill 100 people. I'd say they're specifically trying to avoid civilians based on those numbers.

Secondly, it's important to remember that the war crime is putting civilians in harm's way, not shooting at a terrorist who is using a human shield. By the Geneva convention itself, placing weapons or military personnel in a protected building or vehicle causes it to lose its protected status. The horrific war crime is intentionally putting civilians in harm's way, which Hamas admits to openly, saying that they celebrate the martyrdom of any civilian who dies in the fight with Israel.

Thirdly, Israel is not even using that clause of the Geneva convention indiscriminately. Look at the Al-Shifa hospital. We have footage of a Hamas fighter launching a rocket from its steps, and yet Israel didn't bomb it. They went in on foot, and on top of that, brought Arabic speaking medics and medical supplies for the hospital's patients.

Another thing that people never seem to want to talk about is the ethics of fighting terrorists who commit constant war crimes. When they employ human shields, it's important to take steps to reduce civilian casualties, but it's also absolutely crucial to *not let the terrorist strategy work*. If you refuse to strike them back simply because it creates civilian casualties, you openly admit defeat and give them carte blanche to kill your people without fear of reprisal. It's horrifying to have to fight an enemy with such depraved disregard for life, but you simply cannot allow them to win by doing so. So you have to strike. And people will die. And it's horrible. But the war crime is on the side using human shields, not the side forced to shoot at them.

Regarding the food and water situation, it absolutely sucks, but there are some things that people also readily overlook.

For one, at the start of the war, they shut off the water and then restored it to the south. While the take you often saw in the media was one of shock and condemnation, consider this: is it possible that doing so forced civilians into leaving the north and heading south, moving some of them out of the way of the bulk of the bombs they wanted to drop? That's not a decision I'd want on my shoulders, but there's a chance it actually saved lives overall.

But there's another thing to consider. Why is Gaza reliant on Israel for water? There was a $118M internationally-funded water desalination plant that was paid for in 2020, but the funds disappeared in Hamas's hands and nothing materialized. Over and over, Hamas has neglected or actively dismantled water infrastructure. They should be self-sufficient right now, and the reason they aren't is because of Hamas. Time and time again, Hamas reappropriated funds for, or actively dismantled, critical civilian infrastructure.

Hamas is the official government of Gaza, and declared war on Israel on October 7. Their stance is that they (Palestine) are a sovereign state hostile to Israel. There is no precedent in history for a country being responsible for supplying critical infrastructure to an enemy state that declared active war on it. The fact that Israel has supplied them with any water at all is down to the moral conviction of Israel. We aren't talking about a nation bombing the enemy's water treatment plants (that's a war crime), we are talking about a nation being expected to supply critical infrastructure to an enemy state in a time of war and choosing to shut it down. Would Ukraine be forced to supply water and power to Russian civilians right now? It's never been done. And the reason Gaza has no infrastructure isn't because it's never been funded - it's because the funds have been embezzled and anything built gets cannibalized for parts to build rockets with.

Would I shut it down if I was in charge? Absolutely not. But I have absolutely no appetite for war and would never in a million years seek a position in Israeli leadership where I know I'd be forced to make wartime decisions. I don't envy anyone being forced to make wartime decisions right now.

I don't think civilians deserve to suffer, and certainly not to die, but I think that most Canadians have no idea what it means to deal with jihadists. They're sadists who reveled in dismembering children, burning babies alive, and raping women until their pelvises shattered. And they're actually *happy* for their civilians to die, because they believe it martyrs them and grants them an eternity in heaven. So they construct depraved moral traps where shooting at them means shooting at civilians, and cutting off their supplies means cutting off supplies to civilians.

It's horrible, but the war crimes, as defined by the Geneva convention, are theirs. It makes civilian deaths and suffering no less tragic, but Hamas are the ones who ensure it takes place."

"Likud was born from a terrorist group, their entire brand is violence but I think that in this situation now, you may be right! I think there is a growing number of Israeli citizens seeing this and realizing Bibi has made Israel just as much a bad guy as Hamas in many peoples eyes.

I think it's refreshing to see PP not give-in and actually give a real answer, when we are so normalized by government officials never giving a straight answer.

Yeah I just watched the crowds cheer when they brought that poor girls naked broken molested body into the town square. We also have decades of experience in Afghanistan and Iraq that proves your way of thinking is naive to the extreme.
"Sure it doesn't make them expendable, but it definitely frames what peace would actually look like. Supporting Palestine liberation movements are like advocating expanding the borders of Afghanistan. It basically just expands the reach and influence of a Taliban like minded society."
"1. What do you mean ""give them""? They have ways to do so. They could have done a protest. Unfortunately, when they do have ""peaceful"" protests they have violent undertones and a minority that is overtly violent - for example int he mass marches towards the border.

Not to mention, you seem to be unversed in the situation. Prior t Oct. 7 - the situation for Gazzans was better than it had been in decades. Israel allowed more and more Palestinians across the border with work visas, it had turned a blind eye to rockets fired into its territory (which is criminal in my eyes, as that sent a message that the people in Southern Israel were less important than those in the center), and allowed more and more foreign money into Gaza (which went directly to Hamas). We all believed that if they are offered economic security - they will stop trying to kill us. We were wrong. Some of the Gazzan workers in Israel came after the massacre and rape on Oct. 7 to loot the homes of the dead... Clearly no sane Israeli will allow a Gazzan to enter their home or workplace ever again...  
Comparing it to Canada's indigenous people is ridiculous. First Nations people in Canada are 1% of the populations. Palestinians and Jews int he combined territories of Israel and Palestine are split almost evenly half and half. Unlike Canadians, Israelis **didn't** commit genocide. Not to mention it's a completely different culture, with completely different issues. Israel isn't trying to build a pipeline through Gaza - it left Gaza 20 years ago - forcibly evicting Jews to do so. We wanted nothing to do with that place any more.  


2. Why do you assume I don't want a two-state solution? I do. I've been arguing for a two state solution my whole life. I've been voting for Socialist parties my whole life (in Israel and Canada both). I've gone to protests in Israel for a two state solution and for an end to the occupation. According to polls **most** Israelis want a two state solution... That's why we tried... once int he 90s, twice int he 2000s.. So far, it hasn't work. Not even when we decided ""fuck it, we're withdrawing the settlers by force, and just letting the Palestinians work out things for themselves"" - what happened? Hamas took over, one of the most radical anti-peace movements in Gaza. 

&#x200B;

And by the way, do you know who wanted a two state solution more than anyone? The victims of the oct. 7th massacre. The kibbutzim are communist agricultural villages. Those are the most leftist people in Israel. Many of them were peace activists who knew people in Gaza. 

&#x200B;

3. Sure. But that's not really relevant to this... Israel never tried to forcibly convert Muslims, so not sure what that has to do wit this. My point is: there are always civilian casualties in war. 33,000 children died from NATO bombs in Afghanistan because that's how bombing works. 

  
Imagine if tomorrow, 10,000 Quebecois terrorists stormed the border, killing 1,200 people in Ontario, raping, mutilating their bodies, burning their homes, killling children in front of parents, taking 240 people hostage, including children, elderly and woman (including a pregnant woman who has now given birth in captivity).

Unfortunately Hamas will literally shoot people trying to flee then turn around and blame it on Israel."
"You seem confused about what indiscriminate bombing is. Maybe go tell Hamas to stop using their own people as human shields.

It's a war. Israel can destroy Gaza and kill every Palestinian if they wanted to. But they don't. If the Palestinians had the same military power they wouldn't hesitate to kill every Israeli citizen.

Whether they let them back in is another matter altogether. Judging by recent government and military commentary, seems likely they'll stay.

Plus if we’re going to be so loose with it then what about First Nations reserves in the west?  White people can’t own land or vote in band meetings so technically those are apartheid states too. Even more so intact than Israel where Palestinians have their own political parties, sit on the Supreme Court, can own land, businesses, and all kinds of things.  More rights than they have in Palestine or any of the surrounding arab nations in fact.

Calling genocide when the word was literally invented by a Jewish victim of the holocaust to reference what happened to the Jews.  Appropriating it and redefining it to weaponize it against the victims of that genocide attempt is blatantly antisemitic.  Or calling Jews Nazis again weaponizing the term against the exact victims of the Nazis in defence of Palestine who’s leadership was party to it and helped Hitler with his final solution AND was an architect of modern Islamic extremism and it’s obsession with Jewish eradication.

Totally remember the Jews multiplying like rabbits, getting fat, living long lives and riding around on horseback in Auschwitz /s

Or “colonialism” when it is proven by all historical record, carbon dating, everything that the Jewish homeland is Israel meanwhile Palestine was founded on the erasure of the jews and the Islamic colonial conquest of the region that sought to erase them and subjugated them for generations.

People are just so poorly informed and despite their good intentions are just useful fools feeding into exactly what Hamas wants.

Meanwhile people claim to care about Arab rights while completely ignoring issues ignoring them like the 1.7 million Muslims being forcibly evicted from Pakistan as we speak, or the countless slaughters and oppressions that have happened in the last 100 years or he’ll even just the last few years that dwarf anything Israel has done by a LONG SHOT.

You don’t care about any lives or you woudln’t make such silly comments.  Just parroting nonsense Hamas talking points and clearly haven’t done actual work to understand the conflict.

And of course the obvious reliance on the UN.  The decayed global forum never meant to be a moral arbiter to begin with and their love of redefining words so they can use them hyperbolically for more emotionally evocative headlines.

Here’s a recent and classic example of the UN.  Just this past October 30th they appointed IRAN of all places as the CHAIR of the new Human rights council.  Now in the past weeks since Iran has take. The opportunity to start executing women for not following Sharia law…. Not a peep out of the UN though.  But plenty about Israel oh ya and that’s right Iran arms Hamas and also calls for the extermination of the Jews.  Weird coincidence.  I fully expect more “UN” and “definitely not Iran” statements condemning Israel in months to come.

Not to even get into them putting Iran on women’s rights councils in the past, or that every single council on the middle eats is seated by all the countries that want Israel destroyed and yet Israel is never allowed a seat on councils for the region in which is exists giving a lovely platform for those who want the Jews dead and Israel all of two minutes to respond the “findings”.  Finding that even in 2018 were spewing headlines “condemning Israel’s attacks” when the item they were discussing took place in the late 40s almost 100 years ago.  

It goes on and on. But anyone who has ever actually follows the UN knows what a joke it is and that anyone parroting their rhetoric passionately is not fit to even comment on the topics being discussed."

"You have organizations and countries literally trying to genocide Israel (Hamas, Iran) and have historically tried to genocide Israel (Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon) and the Arab countries basically expelled their Jewish populations after 1948. For context, this is a people that just survived the holocaust... For Palestine you have... nothing really. Does Israel's ""genocide"" count? Lmaoooo, the worlds most inefficient genocide of... -100% over 20 years (Gaza population grew in the last 20 years). So let's be real here. Israel and Palestine's situation is nothing close to equal."
"This is because Germany used to be run by a man named Hitler and according to Wikipedia, he wasn't very nice.  They feel a debt to the Jewish people."
and is that what october 7th was to you?
"> “Trash culture from their backwards countries” — this is some straight up racist, Islamophobic garbage. You ought to be ashamed but you probably won’t be based on some of your other comments on here.


Oh so Iran, Palestine, Egypt, Jordan, etc aren't backwards countries? Countries without LGBTQ rights, who treat women as inferiors? Where child brides, child marriages, beating of wives is allowed? Tell me, are these not backwards countries with backwards cultures? If not, what exactly is so progressive of these trash countries? This isn't Islamophobia, this is being on the right side of history, the one where you are treated equal despite your sex, sexual orientation, etc.

Like seriously, think of your Western values and compare them to these countries and then stop and think of moment."
How is it racist if they said that Muslims that don't support this culture are fine? It's like saying after 1945 - I am good with accepting Germans as long as they don't bring their shitty Nazi culture here.
"Wait, context here, Iran public is against Palestine? Odd to me that they are chanting against Palestine instead of Hamas. That's news to me but I guess the people of Iran are going against their trash government? I really hope for a better future for their people if so especially with the stories I hear such as the public actually being pro-women a few years ago. Maybe there will be a future where Iran becomes one of the progressive countries in the Middle East once they can kick out their trash government.

I guess there was a reason most Persians I met and know were nice people and had no issues integrating with Western values!"
"I was hoping for something a little more comprehensive then a video 😅 but yes I agree the behaviour of Hamas is abhorrent, I assume those celebrating on the side were also Hamas but I’m not sure I’m not a video forensics expert.

I’m not arguing the Palestinian population isn’t antisemitic, just that they, especially the children, don’t deserve to die because of it. 

The years of experience in Afghanistan and Iraq are on my side actually. Even putting aside the moral question, killing innocent civilians only radicalizes those who are left to mourn them. The IDF can’t destroy Hamas, they’ll just pop back up or a new organization will take its place. If you want to stop terrorist groups from recruiting you have to make yourself seem like the better option. If Israel put in place a plan to help develop Gaza, or if we had done the same in Afghanistan, then we could have choked the terrorist groups out by making them the obstacle to prosperity to the average population"
"Personally I think Afghanistan is an interesting comparison actually because it has had periods of secularism and has fallen into Taliban hands twice after periods of war. My own view is that Palestine, like Afghanistan, has shown itself capable of secularism. But that secularism really peaked after two decades of economic growth and declined after the peace process in the 90s ended with a really unworkable mess in the West Bank and both sides sunk deeper into retribution.

So IMO Hamas is absolutely a major impediment to Israeli safety and to Palestine's safety and aspirations but I don't think I can write off that Palestine can exist peacefully. I think the challenge is creating those conditions - I think de-escalation is necessary, and I think whatever future authority governs Palestine it must be watching Hamas type groups like a hawk if a two state solution comes to pass so that things don't get sabotaged and the cycle of violence doesn't start back up. It's not easy but countries have come back from hating each other and recovered from even worse than Hamas, I mean hell Germany is unrecognisable compared to the 40s, thank god.

And to that end as unworkable as a two state solution may seem right now it's really still the closest this came to being resolved, and I can't see a one state solution working without way more potential for violence than the former, especially considering the demographics would obliterate Israel's raison d'être unless something drastic was done which would just escalate the cycle of violence IMO. 

I mean it's just frustrating growing up when I did, and I imagine you probably feel this too and just have different conclusions, and seeing things get close to a peaceful end then seeing things get worse and worse as the same conflicts keep repeating like a really violent, really slow metronome. I don't think the status quo can continue for the safety of civilians on either side, and that's going to require some hard choices no matter what."

Have you not being paying attention to Hamas before this? 

They literally threw members of Fatah off of rooftops when they violently took over Gaza in the first place.

Here's a report from Amnesty International, a group generally known for being rather anti-Israel, literally stating that Hamas forces tortured and killed Palestinians: https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/05/gaza-palestinians-tortured-summarily-killed-by-hamas-forces-during-2014-conflict/

Here's B'Tselem, another NGO that tends to go rather hard against Israel, maintaining a list of Palestinians *executed* by Hamas: https://statistics.btselem.org/en/stats/since-cast-lead/by-date-of-incident/execution-hamas/occupied-territories?tab=overview

Note that that's not killed, that's literally ""given a death sentence and executed"". Notice how most of them were for ""collaboration with Israel"" or ""collaboration with a hostile entity""?

With regards to them blocking the evacuation, there are a few things to look at.

This source is from the IDF, which yes I know, problematic, but until all this is over and things can be corroborated and verified, there's unfortunately no other way such a thing could be released: https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/idf-press-releases-regarding-the-hamas-israel-war/october-pr/hamas-terrorists-continue-to-prevent-civilian-evacuation/

But here's The Guardian, another outlet that tends to lean anti-Israel, reporting on Hamas telling Gazans NOT to evacuate: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/13/first-thing-hamas-tells-gaza-city-residents-to-stay-put-after-israel-orders-evacuation

Here's a short video and some analysis of the explosion on Salah al-Din street, that Hamas blamed on Israel: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67114281

While it says weapon experts can't confirm what caused it... frankly it would seem absurd to think this is an Israeli air strike. Those would be using bombs designed to level small buildings, and here it looks like a few cars at the epicenter were destroyed and are on fire, but not much else was damaged besides those, which seems a lot more in line with what you'd expect from an IED on the road than an air strike or even artillery fire. Those would leave a sizeable and visible crater at the very least.

>Whether they let them back in is another matter altogether. Judging by recent government and military commentary, seems likely they'll stay.

This is what scares me as well. Hopefully once they've cleared Hamas from the north, they'll help facilitate the set up of temporary refugee camps in the north, and secure passage from the south, before moving on to clear the south. If they try to push them out of Gaza altogether, with no definite plan on their return, that will be straight up ethnic cleansing, though I can't see Egypt agreeing to anything like that without some *strong* guarantees that the refugees will be cared for and watched by international groups (e.g. the UN), and later allowed to return.

>Shitshow altogether. Shouldn't have expected better from this right wing government.

Agreed. While I can completely understand why this operation has become unfortunately necessary, I don't for a second think Bibi and his cronies are above using this to secure power in every way possible."
So you'd rather let him continue his attacks on the other kids in the school? Yikes. What would you do?
"So what would you do? Special forces can come in and try to eliminate the threat but they will still be firing at the human shields the gunman is using. It's essentially the same thing but now you risk more people's lives as these special forces can also get shot at and killed. Also, do you have time to do reconnaissance? The longer it goes on the higher the chance gunman escapes and kills the other kids in the school. You can't just throw reconnaissance and special forces at everything and expect it to work lmao.

And for a more accurate comparison...
> Think of it this way, if a gunman went in and shot up your neighborhood and killing friends and family, threatens to do it again and then uses his own child as a human shield while shooting at you, what would you do? Let him get away to kill the rest of your neighborhood? Not shoot? Call for a ceasefire so he gets away, threatening to do the same thing as many times as he can? He's still shooting at you by the way and he started his shooting spree under the previous ceasefire. What would you do? Anyone who cares about his friends and family will do what Israel is doing.

What would you do here?"
"I’m done you guys. 14,000 is not a “small casualty count”… and some estimates are even higher. I’ve seen ones as high as 20,000, but I’ve kept it conservative. 

But even 14,000 is roughly on pace to about match about half of the Holocaust if it were to last as long. But yeah… such low casualties. Couldn’t be anywhere close to genocide! Hitler spent 12 years doing it, and didn’t eliminate them all… I mean, if he wanted to do it, he would have done it right away in one fell swoop, right? … he failed, and *attempted* genocides or *partial genocides* or *genocides offset by a high birth rate that results in half the population being under 18 as most are killed by the poor conditions they’re kept in by Israel…* … nah, these just *can’t* be genocides!

"> Israel killed over 100 civilians in a single strike. This is a war crime and completely unacceptable to anyone who values human life.

Except it's not because there were military targets (or atleast supposedly) in that area. Maybe look up international law and what actually constitutes a war crime instead of parroting what other uninformed are doing/saying. Also, where are you getting 100, even Hamas controlled Gaza health ministry puts the number at 50ish."
"Too long, didn't read"
"Sure and Palestine is welcome to wage wars just like any other country, and they deal with the consequences of waging such wars.

Palestine is not some innocent baby.  The majority have supported what Hamas calls for Jewish extermination since before Israel even existed and in almost every poll since Hamas won their election in the 2000s.  Abbas even “delayed” the West Bank elections a few years ago because the top two candidates were Hamas leadership.  
And in the municipal elections in 2022 Hamas was leading all polls and then refused to be in the ballot because they know how this perceived separation serves them.

Not all Palestinians support Hamas, no culture is a monolith. 
But to pretend the culture within Palestine and particularly the Gaza is not built around martyrdom and the directive of Jewish eradication just shows a person has not bothered to actually pay attention to Palestine and it’s own culture and self professed goals and ideals."

I believe the ""from the river to the sea"" which is seen as support of terrorist ideology by some, was originally something Begin stated, albeit in the opposite sense in which it was related to Israeli sovereignty."
"> It’s crazy to see the propaganda work on you guys.

The irony here is WILD. What makes them better? Acting like the conflict between Hamas and Israel started on October 7th is a perfect example of propaganda. 
I am not at ALL denying this is what Hamas wanted, but pretending that Bibi has not wanted this exact excuse to do what Israel is doing now is naive at best and wilful ignorance at worst. You can pull up videos of him speaking about this for YEARS, you can pull up quotes from previous Israeli leaders like Begin making similar comments going back decades. 

Theres no ""higher moral standard"" when Israel has been caught lying multiple times as a means to justify their murder of THOUSANDS civilians, MANY of them children. 

Israel not nuking Gaza does not give them a moral high ground. They are not stupid, they know they cant go full throttle and lose the backing of the allies that prevent them from being a sitting duck for the countries that surround them. Just as they have for decades, their propaganda war goes hand in hand with the atrocities they are committing. 

Unless you feel like the life of an innocent Palestinian child is worth less than the life of an innocent Israeli child, then you'd recognize that terrorism is terrorism. Israels own government officials have been on video talking about wiping out children. Bibi himself had the nerve to allude to a biblical story that referenced not only killing every man and woman of a people, but their children, babies and livestock. 

He is on video talking about how he planned to skirt the various treaty agreements going back years and years, and how easily Americans can be manipulated to keep them onside. 

If Israel was not well aware of the war crimes they were committing, they wouldnt be dependent on lying to justify their actions, like pretending a calendar is a list of terrorist in a hosptial or taking clips from movies and implying that its Palestinians faking injuries, or pretending they found a PERFECT copy of Mein Kampf with notes on a terrorist... we've all seen the children being pulled dead from rubble, what I have not seen as much of, is Hamas terrorists in the rubble of the civilian targets the IDF have destroyed."

"Let's look at history then,

Jews were about 4% of the population in the Palestinian region, then exploded to 33% by 1936 through mass immigration (which the Arab majority who lived there did not consent too). This policy of mass Jewish immigration was focused on creating Jewish majority areas for the sole creation of a Jewish state (again, without the consent of the Arab majority). The Arabs had no say basically in the transformation of racial demographics in their region. Imagine if Europe became 33% Muslim. The mass immigration of Muslims in Europe only raised the Muslim population by a few percent and there is already massive tension and rise of right wing parties.

The demographic change in Palestine was a horrible idea. The local Arabs didn't want it but had no control, so there was always going to be ethnic strife. Things got even worse when the land was being split, since the original borders of Israel before the events in 1948 had many cities which were borderline half Arab and half Jewish, with many Arabs not wanting to become Israelis and wanted to join other Arab nations.

While I do argue for Israel's continued existence today since the events in history cannot be changed, I personally disagree with the very idea of a return to a Jewish homeland. It was always going to come into conflict with those who were living in the region."

Powerful voices from all around the world will whisper in the ears of young men for generations that fighting Israel is the most noble and honourable thing they can do. The cocktail of religion, notoriety and money will make the allure of violence impossible to ignore in Palestine.

The campaign has been organised by the militant Hamas movement - which dominates Gaza and is designated a terrorist group by Israel - and other groups.  


**The Israeli government said terrorists wanted to use the protests as cover to cross into its territory and carry out attacks.** It deployed soldiers along the border fence, who it said were ordered to resort to live fire only when absolutely necessary and when there was an imminent threat.""

C. Cases were soldiers fire at unarmed civilians who do not pose a threat are investigated. Sometimes the soldiers held responsible are court-martialed. I will be the first to agree that too often, irresponsible soldiers get off without punishment - in Israel as in every army.

"I am familiar with Hamas. Perhaps not as intimately as I know Hezbollah, but well enough. Media to Iran backed proxies is everything. They're not stupid. They know they need the support of the local population if they're to continue to rule Gaza effectively and stay in power. They don't want to become a second Fatah.

Fatah is a local Palestinian authority Hamas considers to have corroborated with Israel and sold the Palestinian cause. True on both counts. Them killing each other is expected. Fatah in the west bank doesn't treat Hamas any gentler. Civil wars aren't pretty, and your treatment to your enemies doesn't equate to your treatment of everyone.

I know how Hamas treats Gazans. My friends are Atheists, and they're VERY vocal about how brutal and oppressive Hamas is as a regime. This is besides the point. It would still be utterly stupid for Hamas to blow the media war they're winning just to strike at 0 relevant targets. Not even Al Jazeera would justify this, and Western affiliated media would absolutely report it to the sky if it was reliably confirmed. Look how they ran with 40 decapitated babies.

Hamas knows it can't win the war. Its hoping instead to win the hearts of future Palestinians and the Islamic world (their disapproval rate was extremely high before the operation according to Arab Barometer). It seems they've largely managed to flip public opinion, though its yet unclear.

Israel's aggression may be justifiable to you from Afar, but the Palestinian kid who loses relatives, friends and family is going to grow up with a loyalty to the only resistance against Israel, Hamas.

Arab states on the verge of normalisation are going to deal with generations that see the massive death toll and become diametrically opposed to normalisation with Israel. This is what keeps Hamas alive. Reminding people they have a cause.

In this sense, Hamas has succeeded. They gained a lot. If they can survive intact, I'll call it a positive war overall for their movement.

They'd be utter idiots to blow it by gunning down down their own people. Telling them to stay is believable and easily justified, but forcing them? And why? To boost an already massive death toll? May as well be throwing away everything they've worked for.

The strike at Salah Al-Din street I am not in a position to judge, but several analysts have said it seems like a failed Islamic Jihad missile, and I am not disinclined to believe them. To be sure, we'll have to wait and see.

Regarding the exodus to Egypt, I agree with you on that. There's no way they accept with their weak economy, knowing Hamas is Muslim brotherhood affiliated. I'll add that taking northern Gaza and not allowing Palestinians back would be also be ethnic cleansing."

You're talking about collateral damage vs intentional rape, torture, murder and civilian kidnappings on a mass scale. When Hamas had the opportunity to take the IDF by surprise, they decided to instead incite this necessary response and take the opportunity to get some pleasure from the mass killing of jews. They just miscalculated, they thought Hezbollah and Iran would support their genocidal goals and start a larger conflict with Israel.

I do not see the same moral degradation from Israel at all. Hamas has no method of redemption, they must be destroyed to move forward. Israel is a democracy, they have the ability to change, Hamas is just stagnating Gaza and creating chaos in pursuit of their genocide. Israel was moving forward with peace deals throughout the Arab world.

Hey, maybe think about what was happening during this time. I'll give you a hint, it was an actual genocide starting with Holo____. It showed the need for a people without a homeland and state to have a homeland and state to fight for them and create a safe haven for Jews.


>  It was always going to come into conflict with those who were living in the region.

So basically because they were xenophobic and racist and because they refused to peacefully co-exist with refugees, they themselves became refugees after trying to genocide such refugees that were just victim of genocide. 

Fact is, there was never a Palestine or Palestinian state. Palestine had the chance to become a state in 1938 and 1948 but rejected both times.

>  I personally disagree with the very idea of a return to a Jewish homeland.

See, this is interesting to think about. If you disagree with the very idea of a return to Jewish homeland because people live there, that also means you reject the idea of a return to a ""Palestinian homeland"" because... well, people live there now."
">The demographic change in Palestine was a horrible idea. The local Arabs didn't want it but had no control, so there was always going to be ethnic strife.

100%.

I think Jewish people do have ancestral land in the levant, including Palestine.

I also think it was the dumbest idea to give them a homeland that meant displacing Muslim Arabs where they would be surrounded by Muslims Arabs.

The Brits and western Europeans were still playing Empire games at the time.

Remember Palestine was under the Ottoman Empire from 1500s-1900s. The Brits helped get rid of the Ottomans, so they sort of thought they got to decide what happens to the land now.

The idea of a Palestinian identity separate from other arabs was suggested by the Brits. The country was going to be called Transjordan, and it was going to include Jordan and Palestine.

Then the Brits decided the Jews needed a homeland too and decided to encourage the return .

The Brits are idiots and encouraged nationalism among two people groups, and encouraged one of those groups to colonize the lands of the other.

Then they were like ""derppp we're gonna leave now you guys play nice"".

Immediately the Arabs attacked Israel and took Gaza and the West Bank.

I see both sides of victims of dumbass British empire fucking people groups lands up. They just couldn't help themselves but fuck around with the land even though they knew their empire was up. They left a huge mess."
"Hmmm, the only other possible source I know of is representing the ancient enemy of Israel, the Philistines which interestingly enough is closed to Filistin unless there's some translation difference I am not aware of here. What was the source of the name ""Palestine"" then?"

Palestine has never existed. They had the chance to but they rejected it instead preferring to try and genocide the Jews in 1948

"> So now you are digging in and defending your Islamophobia? Stunning!

Wait, so you think treating women as equals and all those other progressive human rights is equal to Islamophobia? Seriously? That's Islamophobia now? Weird because plenty of immigrants from these countries treat women fine and adapted to Canadian values! Which are the people we want. What we don't want are those who do not adopt to Canadian values.

> Lastly, a small technicality, Palestine isn’t a country. It’s a militarily occupied territory whose people are stateless and have very few rights.

The rights in Palestine are decided by their governing bodies, Hamas for Gaza and PLA for West Bank. Sure, they aren't a country and never have been but they actually have governments... who do not give rights to LGBTQs and give few rights to women while men do have rights."
Cheers to them and hope they find peace. Would bring great stability to the Middle East if Iran could get it's shit government out. This gives me hope for such a future.
"They did not in fact « go right back » to the taliban, the problem in Afghanistan is that we made no effort to do state building and very quickly withdrew from the country, leading the taliban to retake it. Since then over a million Afghans fled the country and many anti Taliban afghanis have been killed. While some are of course more sympathetic to the Taliban that is again born out hatred for America, often because they killed someone they knew. People aren’t born terrorists. They’re made into them by their environment, and often times we contribute to their environment being shit.

I agrée many people are antisemitic, and this event has caused them to come out of the woodwork, on both the left and the right. I’m honestly not sure how many people say from the river to the sea with genocidal intention, some do of course but there are also variations of it like « from the river to the sea Palestinians will be free » which implies an appeal for human rights not the destruction of Israel and the expulsion of its population.

Not to mention even if most Palestinians are Hamas and want to kill Jews there are still individuals in Gaza that don’t believe that. And individuals should be weighed by their own beliefs and actions not those beliefs and actions you associate with their ethnic group."
"Key problem there is the “Israeli government said” part.

Like, saying the protestors independent observers are insisting were peaceful were clearly guilty enough to justify preemptively murdering them is already a pretty dubious claim.

"Christian families are the largest landowners in Bethlehem and have often been subject to theft of property. Bethlehem's core of traditional Christian and Muslim families speak of the rise of a 'foreign', more conservative, Islamic Hebronite class as changing the traditional regional identity of the town, as are the villages dominated by the Ta'amre Bedouin clans close to Bethlehem. Rising Muslim land purchase, said at times to be Saudi-financed, and incidents of land theft with forged documents, except in Beit Sahour where Christian and Muslims share a strong sense of local identity, are seen by Christians as making their demographic presence vulnerable. Christians are often described as of Yamani descent (as are some Muslim clans), vs the al-Qaysi Muslim clans, respectively from southern and northern Arabia. Christians are wary of the international media and of discussing these issues publicly, which involve criticism of fellow Palestinians, since there is a risk that their remarks may be manipulated by outsiders to undermine Palestinian claims to nationhood, distract attention from the crippling impact of Israel's occupation, and conjure up an image of a Muslim drive to oust Christians from Bethlehem.\[96\]  
  
The Christian Broadcasting Network (an American Protestant organization) claimed that Palestinian Christians suffer systematic discrimination and persecution at the hands of the predominantly Muslim population and Palestinian government aimed at driving their population out of their homeland.\[97\] However, Palestinian Christians in Bethlehem and Beit Jala have claimed otherwise that it is the loss of agricultural land and expropriation from the Israeli military, the persecution of 1948 and violence from the military occupation that has led to a flight and major exodus of Christians.\[98\]

It's a lot of paperwork and a lot of waiting.

"How do you expect any reports to be verified or corroborated? The only information we can possibly get out of there has to come from either Hamas or the IDF. 

So let's look at who they might be targeting their propaganda towards.

Internally, Hamas will simply not report on anything they do, and blame Israel for everything. I'm not suggesting they're going on mass shooting sprees or anything crazy (for them anyways), but they're actively trying to keep civilians in the warzone knowing that it will get them killed. I've already listed a couple ways they do that. Something like an IED would be trivial for them to set up quietly at night when nobody is around, then blame on Israel. Who is going to openly question them internally when they're known to execute dissenters?

They could shoot a few people from far enough away that the shooter won't be spotted. People run scared instead of trying to flee to the south, and Hamas just has to say ""Israeli snipers did it"", and again, who would openly say anything against that?

Next, let's look at western groups. Anything happening in areas that are outside of IDF control you basically only have Hamas as the source. Despite this, media outlets have shown a willingness to simply take whatever they say at face value. We saw it happen with Al-Ahli. Media outlets the world over reported ""hospital strike kills hundreds"". The more honest ones would put somewhere in the article that ""Gaza officials"" alleged an Israeli strike hit the hospital and the IDF denied it and suggested a Palestinian rocket misfired.

We know now that the misfire was the truth, and the ""hundreds"" killed a gross exaggeration, but it doesn't matter when tens, if not hundreds of headlines around the world reported that Israel hit a hospital. There are plenty of people more than willing to simply accept that as truth, even as major media outlets published retractions over the next days as more and more evidence piled up to support that it was a misfired rocket that hit the parking lot, and the hospital itself was undamaged.

So again, I'm not suggesting they're engaging in a full on massacre of their own people. But are they willing to kill a few here and there when it benefits them and they can get away with it? Absolutely."

Lmao, sure, bomb everyone in the school! More like, bomb the room the terrorist is in with his human shields to protect the rest of the school.

Again, question is simple, what would you do?"
"Again, keep minimizing. You can look forward to being on the wrong side of history."
"Ah yes, of course I’ve stumbled into the timeline where supporting those who call to finish Hitler’s work and who literally collaborated with Hitler on his Final Solution are the “right side” of history, of course.

"> You are sick for trying to justify this.

I'm not trying to justify it, international law does. 

> Claiming there was a Hamas member in the vicinity of a refugee camp does not mean you can bomb a crowd of civilians.

It's actually allowed. Again, look up international law. This was done to prevent countries from using human shields and civilian infrastructure as shields. This would have, in theory, made human shields have no strategic purpose. Too bad when it came to Hamas, killing their own civilians served a strategic purpose in making Israel look bad and so they embraced using human shields."
"It's literally law to prevent the use of human shields. If human shields are effective, all the shady governments would use them."

"> There is no moral equivalency with that terrorist group

Define moral equivalency and terror group....


Nobody is arguing what Hamas did isnt terrible, what they did isnt justification for what Israel does today... but again you seem intent on pretending this conflict BEGAN on October 7th and we both know it didn't, that is just convenient framing for Israel to act like they have only committed what amounts to war crimes this past month in response to Hamas attacked on October 7th, when in fact, if you would like, I can give him dozens if not hundreds of incidents that predate that in which the IDF have committed acts that you would call terror attacks if it was carried out by Hamas. 

Killing tens of thousands of innocent people simply because they share an ethnicity with a terror group, is terrorism itself.  If ""moral degradation"" is what you need to see, if I point out the words of israels leader alluding to killing not only the men and women, but the children and babies by referencing a biblical story in which that happened which puts into context the IDF current murders, is that moral degradation? If I point to military officials in the IDF telling their soliders to kill all Palestinians on camera, is that moral degradation?  The decades of actions of the IDF murdering innocent Palestinians, including women and children is that moral degradation??

To suggest that its only Hamas that has ideas of genocide are just ignoring the reality of what is happening in Gaza currently. For every civilian building bombed to the ground, have you seen evidence from Israel that it contained Hamas fighters?? When it all but shut down a hospital full of sick people and new born babies it had to lie about the calendar found inside to justify its actions, whats the moral justification for that? a war crime.  When it used collective punishment to shut out water, food, medicine and power to MILLIONS of innocent people, a war crime, is that not moral degradation?


Hamas is terrible, but as of today, right now... what has Hamas done that the Israeli Government not done to the innocent civilians in Gaza? If Hamas fights took over a part of Israel and went into hospitals and schools, would Israel kill its own citizens the way it killed Plaestinians, or does it ideologically see Palestinians lives as less valuable than Israeli lives... moral equivalency? this is 2 groups acting as terrorists. 

Here is Netenyahu himself admitting he had no intention of adhering to previous agreements and accords, so October 7th was not a catalyst or this conflict, Israel has broken agreements and accords and ceasefires for the 70ish years its existed.

You do realize this is a 75 year conflict not a 40 day one. 

Just because Hamas actually did something atrocious doesn’t negate all the actual murder and destruction and ethnic cleansing that the actual ethno state is committing. 

Israel can’t just bomb whatever it wants and say, oh a Hamas soldier was there so it’s ok. Nowhere in the civilized world will we allow a military to bomb an entire refugee camp to kill one guy. 

Even the Al Shifa hospital that the IDF said was a Hamas command centre turned out to be nothing. They’ve been shown to have planted evidence and doctored videos and called a children’s calendar and militant schedule for watching hostages, that were never in that hospital at all."

You clearly have no interest in actually providing an answer to my main question.

The expectation that this would not trigger a larger conflict is pure delusion, of course it did.

Even if what you say is true, that Israel is equally as genocidal as Hamas (it’s clearly not), then don’t you think how they treat their own populations still puts Israel above Hamas? Obviously Israel has a lot more care for the well being of Israelis, whereas Hamas just oppresses as needed to maintain power and further their genocidal goals.

"No they didn’t. They compared the IDF and Israeli Government to Hamas, they did not compare Likud to Hamas.

Hamas is genocidal for so many other reasons, I wouldn’t list waving a banner saying “death to Jews” or “death to Israel” as a top 10 reason.

There were more Jews living in New York then in the Palestinian region at the time, they could have easily moved fo New York instead. If the local population was against it, why were they forced against their will to accept it? Would you accept 100,000 Syrian refugees who wanted to import their culture and way of life with no plans to assimilate?

Because that was traditionally the Israeli homeland but let's throw the past out and focus on the time period. In that time period its not like Palestine actually had responsibility or a choice. They were under British rule and the British chose it. There was never a state of Palestine before.

> The Palestinians for less than 100, people are still alive who were displaced.

Who were displaced because they tried to genocide the Jews but failed.

Personally, I am of the opinion a Palestinian state would be fine. But the population would essentially need to be deprogrammed (like Germany/Japan after WW2). We'd need an international coalition to come in and do peace keeping (and counter terrorism) for a while until that happens. Teachers would also need to be from the international community. I wouldn't even trust them to come from Arab countries at that point. We cannot let Israel do it as it would just lead to both Israeli abuse (especially after October 7th) and Palestinian resentment."

Palestine as a state never existed but Palestinians as a people probably exist since many see themselves as such. A people does not need external recognition while a state does.

"Meaningful protest would be something that truly risks having the protestors get what they want.

Like, Israel recognizes an independent arbiter for what land is stolen, or moves the embassy back out of Jerusalem, or they give Palestinians independent access to freaking water.

If anything Palestinian demonstration too big to just be ignored is justification to murder them, then that means the kind of protestor who’d sit on railroad tracks are shown to be naive fools while the ones who’d blow it up are vindicated. And pretending there no connection between that and Hamas’s continued social success is bullshit.

"> I'm not the conflict resolution professional, and quite obviously, neither are you. That's the job of law enforcement or military personnel.

Oh except when military personnel you make a judgement on them when their decision is not to your liking. You are judging what Israel is doing when you obviously admitted this is not your job. So your job is whine about the people getting rid of a threat that wants to genocide them?

> You don't have a sweet clue what you're talking about, and you look even dumber for pretending like you do, sit down.

You don't have any answers or alternatives. You want an imaginary land where everything is peaceful and is solved with talking to each other. Hamas is an organization whose literal reason of existence is to kill all the Jews. If the people of Israel were headed by people like you, they'd all be dead by now.

Give a better alternative or shutup as people who are trying to fix real problems give solutions that, while not palatable, are needed to keep their friends, family and people safe.

Food for thought: If America was in Israel's situation, America would do the same thing Israel is doing. Anthony Blinken, which I guess would be close to a conflict resolution professional, supports what Israel is doing."
"Do you not have reading comprehension. I'm not killing all of the kids, I'm just killing the kids with the gunman to protect all the kids in the school. Oh, and the kids are the gunman's kids."
"They can though, or at the very least riddle that room full of bullets. What, don't tell me they can't even do that?

> You've already admitted that you view Palestinians as lesser people

Woah there bud.

But I still want to ask you, would you shoot through human shields of people related to a terrorist to protect your family and friends?"
">1 civilian death is way too many.

Then why are you waffling about this and acting like it’s even a possibility that Israel’s actions are at all justified???

>We are just trying to tell you that even though that number is very big, it is actually very small compared to what it could have been.

I know 6 million sounds like a number that is very big… but if Hitler had wanted to, he could have killed so many more, so it’s not really THAT big!

50 million may SOUND like a lot… but if he wanted to, Stalin could have NUKED THE WHOLE EARTH! But he didn’t! So killing 50 million doesn’t seem that bad now, does it?

…

🙄

…

You see how stupid that sounds? You don’t sound ANY different right now.

>You are alleging that because that number is big, it must be that Israel is trying to kill civilians, or they are neglecting to protect civilians as much as they can.

The first true thing you’ve said.

>This is not true.

Damn. Couldn’t even get 2 in a row.

>Saying Israel is trying to kill civilians is laughable given their firepower and I explained why.

Your logic here is laughable… and disgusting to boot… and I just explained why.

>I encourage you to go back to my previous comment, click the link and watch what a 155mm shell does. Israel can fire 20,000 of those at gaza a day.

Oh yes,,, how very very gracious of them. Trump has access to nukes… should we all be thanking him for NOT nuking us all???

>You are experiencing shock as someone not accustomed to war.

Lol. Oh yes, I only grew up during the seemingly endless War on Terror, and have been witnessing the Ukraine War for a year and a half now… studied WW2 extensively… Korean War, Vietnam… also did a lot of reading recently about the horrors of the Nakba, as a matter of relevant fact… but oh yes… war so new to me! Do explain oh wise, experienced one! What is it that you know so much about war to make you excuse mass murder, and how do I avoid turning out like you if I know it?

>War is like this. Civilians die and it sucks.

Oh, okay, amazing!!! Such amazing omniscient levels of wisdom here!!! You have indeed proven yourself the High Knower of War. Sun Tzu himself would bow down before you!!!!

🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄

>This is why it is so important to denounce Hamas, which started this war on October 7 by intentionally massacring 1400 Jews.

This “war” did not start on Oct 7. The High Knower of War should learn some history."
"I don't think they are. I think they have the best of intentions but they are going through what I call a civvie tantrum.  


They probably have never seen war in their life, so what they see right now is shocking to them. They see immense suffering and they conclude that the suffering must be intentional just to make sense of it.   


I think it is noble to care about Palestinian civilians, but they are getting mad at the wrong side here. Hamas is responsible for those deaths."
"I’m sure a lot of it is astroturfing, but there’s also a lot of people who ARE dead serious being this type of sick. Regardless, I treat it as genuine, because the conversation gets seen by people on here either way, and leaving it unchecked, astroturfed or not, can mislead naive people."
"What you are doing here is the equivalent of seeing a car hit you at the speed of 10 kmh, and you complain the driver was trying to kill you

You don't know shit about cars, so obviously I am going to show you that car can do 200kmh, so if that driver was trying to kill you he wouldn't have hit you at 10kmh.

You are literally arguing that Israel is intentionally trying to kill as many civilians as possible. I am showing you that that is a stupid ass take given their weaponry. 

This is not a hard concept to understand for reasonable, unemotional people"
"We will see.

And probably less likely to get anyone nuked if people stop buying into and spreading the propaganda of literal terrorist groups to legitimize them and then blaming Israel for responding the way just about any country would."
"I'm just saying the super right wing, racist, PM of Israel, that is currently being accused to killing too many civilians has a giant banner that says 'Death to Arabs' below him. I'm not sure how else to interpret that.

My twisted, 'anti-semetic' world view must have made it really hard for me to interpret basic facts... You're right about the double standards too, they're everywhere..."
">Palestine is way more a religious ethnostate than Israel.

They are both religious ethnostates and will both perpetuate problems because of that fact regardless of which religion is in control. Religious ethnostates are evil and oppressive by definition. 

It's like you are measuring the dick size of two rapists to see who is more at fault. The problem isn't the dick size, it's the rape."
I would trust UAE to teach Wasatiya but I don't see any of that happening. This conflict is way too lucrative for anyone involved.
Ok. Just seems like there's a better way to filter out extremists than asking questions about the colonial ethnostate with a dead soldier cum extraction unit.
"LOL. You are literally doing exactly what the blog post says.

Btw, have you seen any Iranian cinema? Some amazing stuff. One of the world’s best actually!"

You've made the point that you're bloodthirsty. What more do you want?"
Thanks for your hard work! I totally get it!
With a what now??
"> Btw, have you seen any Iranian cinema? Some amazing stuff. One of the world’s best actually!

Sick fuckers. Murdering a German kid at a peace for your cause rave and parading her around to other Children. This is the most evil thing in my lifetime and so sad to see how many love this and support it.
Just got a message from my summer camp that a former camper has been taken hostage in Gaza. God willing she is alive and ok.
How can “Canadians” in Montreal and Toronto cheer Hamas killing Canadians and taking them prisoner?
Israel is going to turn Gaza into a parking lot.  I hope Egypt will open its border to let the 30% of peaceful people in.
"It's sad the Rave where most of the foreign tourist were captured was a "" Peace for Gaza "" rave which was why it was near the border..  then this happened"

Weird how people “defending themselves” take hostages….
"Hamas using human shields, as usual."
Have we ever sent in special forces to evacuate citizens?
"Our government won't do shit to save them.

Seriously, did you ever read about the Canadians that were abducted from Samal Island in the Philippines?

The USA even offered to dispatch US special forces and Canada REFUSED."
"Yet theres fucking manifestations pro terrorists on the streets of toronto and montreal.

Are they even alive. The German woman that was shown half naked dead surrounded by celebrating Palestinians was recorded on video  alive at her capture.
"But I was told that these freedom fighters were just trying to push back the evil Israeli government. Surely these noble men wouldn't just indiscriminately kidnap, torture and kill random civilians unrelated to the conflict"

Hate to say it but boy are they fucked hard.  There is something less than a 0% chance the Canadian government can muster up the gall to even phone someone about this.
Israel is fully justified in liberating Gaza from the Hamas terrorists. The security risk is intolerable and must be mitigated. Ground operations are justified although freeing hostages is always extremely dangerous. Hearts out to those hurt by this tragedy.
Iran is using hamas to distract us while they finish enriching their uranium and building their bombs. We either stop Iran now or not at all. We are literally watching ww3 start.
"All the far left people scrambling through their feeds to delete any pro Palestine nonsense. They fund Hamas and had people celebrating in the streets during 9/11, while also not allowing their women to have full human rights."

"Palestine will sure be ""free"" once it's flattened to rubble with Israeli artillery strikes.."
And the CUPE union supports Hamas
"I wonder when the Hamas team support demonstration will happen here?

We don't have any means to respond to these types of threats.  We had to get the US to shoot down a balloon in our own country for fucks sakes. As we speak, Canada is looking to further slash an already embarrassing military budget.

This is reality and our government is living in a fucking dreamland of diversity and peace, which anybody with a fucking sense can see, is just a dream and all it will ever be."
"Not sure I understand the conflict, every instance I've seen where Israel seemed to be in the wrong involves those mormon looking jews with the hats, but so far every victim I've seen appear to be normal looking people.

*JTF2 has entered the chat*
"All you have to do is examine Israeli border expansion over the last 50 years to realize this “conflict” exists as much as there’s a “conflict” between men and ants. There’s a reason why proportionality is a fundamental principle outlined in the international laws of war codified in the Geneva Conventions. The entire history of this so called war has been expressed via Israeli violence against Palestinians. The death toll of numbers on each side demonstrates a fundamental imbalance of casualties, and that alone should tell you enough as well. Yet, even today we have news outlets peddling this clearly bias perspective, devoid from any truth or understanding of the conflict on the ground. If you publicly question Israel’s position on this issue, you’re labelled an anti semite, even in University spaces where open critical discussions are meant to take place. Israel bombs a park literally full of children, no news coverage, basically nothing mentioned in popular media, except alt news sites like “Democracy Now!” Hamas lashes out and a couple Israeli soldiers who signed up to kill Palestinians are killed, and it’s all over every news outlet across every western nation the next day.

If you want legitimate unbiased education on this issue I recommend you read The Goldstone Report.

Edit: For clarity, the Goldstone Report recognizes and examines atrocities committed on *both sides* of the conflict. However, it also represents legal examination of some of the very limited *on the ground* reports provided *during* a conflict - and the fact is it reflects a disturbing reality of disproportionate use of force and violence by Israel against the Palestinian people."
"Don’t hold your breath for a rescue from Canada, prime minister to busy destroying it"
"I know I am going to get alot of heat for this but this is what Palestinians endure every day and the world has turned a blind eye to it for over 70 years. I am not saying what happened was right by any means but I understand why it has happened. More then 200 Palestinian children are in prisons right now, which is illegal under international law, they live in an occupation which the UN understands resistance is inevitable. The right to self determination has been stripped from them. Checkpoints limit there movement and constant intimidation occurs. The IDF flanks settlers as they walk through Palestinian land as they vandalize, harassing and assault the Palestinians.  IDF evict people from their homes that they have lived in for hundreds of years. The BDS movement around the world was mocked and called Antisemitic when they just wanted a peaceful way to protest. A couple of years ago a Canadian medic, among many others,, were shot in the head while trying to help the wounded. The Aljazzera reporter, among others, were shot and killed while trying to report the story. This is all daily occurrences in Gaza and the west bank. Golan heights was annexed a few years ago with no recourse. What gets me about this whole situation is how can someone turn such a blind eye to all of this and then condemn Palestinians for the reaction? Before you start insulting me, I am not Antisemitic I am antizionist. Learn the difference many many jewish people do not believe what Israel is doing in the name of their religion is right. Israel has broken so many international laws but the world refuses to punish them in anyway. It is understood that Israel has a nuclear capability but they don't allow inspections on their sites by the UN. And I am sure I am missing out a whole lot. So before you reply to give me an ear full or down vote this post, Google the daily life of a Palestinian and try to understand what and why would cause Palestinian people to act this way."
"Over 75 years of injustice towards Palestinians, including rape, torture, kidnapping, urinating on dead bodies, killing of pregnant and kids, and yet you just woke up and are concerned?!"
"Sorry about the ""disgusting"" remark. I thought you said humas."

Israel is an occupation and an apartheid regime and no spin on these events will change these facts. ISRAEL CREATED THIS MONSTER, AND THIS BLOOD SHED IS TO BLAME ON ZIONISTS AND THEIR ENDLESS, BRUTAL, INHUMANE OCCUPATION OF PALESTINE.

Fuck Hamas, but just as much as fuck the IDF (rename to IOF because it’s an invading offensive army) and the settler and Zionist militia."
"The world isn't your playground, it is an active conflict zone regardless of someone trying to throw a dance party."
"Here’s a thought for the pro-Palestine supporters who have been cheering the Hamas attack:

Hamas has had a history of using civilian shields in times of conflict. Are you lot this ignorant or this evil to think that Hamas’ actions earlier this week was the just response to Israel’s deeds? Seriously, you so called enlightened ones are this tribal to abide by the ancient “eye for an eye” philosophy? 

Humanity has indeed left the planet.."

"Well they would try to get on as best they could, but Israel makes sure to keep 50% of the Palestinians unemployed and starving with embargoes on even basic things like coffee while sinking Palestinian fishing boats that try to fish in waters international treaties have said belong the Palestinians.

They'd probably just go home and watch tv, but Israel bombs the only power plant that supplies them power meaning that they experience rolling black outs all day and only half the strip gets power.

But hey, let's ignore all the human rights violations the militaristic colonizer state commits and just focus on how an impoverished colonized people left with no choice for resistance against their colonizers but violence have decided to use violence. How dare those  ~~Congolese~~ ~~Algerians~~ ~~Zimbabweans~~ ~~Vietnamese~~ ~~Native Americans~~ ~~Ukrainians~~ Palestinians use the one avenue of freedom left to them by their colonial rulers!"

"> Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO)

>A Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation (NEO) is a military operation conducted to assist Global Affairs Canada (GAC) in evacuating Canadians and eligible persons from threatening circumstances in a foreign nation and moving them to a safe haven.

>How NEO operates

> A NEO is designed to deploy Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) members in a short or no-notice situation as a result of a sudden, rapidly deteriorating situation that threatens the safety of Canadians abroad.

> GAC is the lead agency in an evacuation operation and will only seek assistance from the Department of National Defence and the CAF after all other options for helping Canadians to leave an affected zone have been exhausted. 

> Once the Government of Canada has approved a NEO, the CAF will: 

> deploy an appropriately scaled Joint Task Force (JTF)* to the affected nation; and
> coordinate its activities in support of GAC and the Canadian Head of Mission.

No doubt regardless of the moral complexity of the situation it needs to come to an end as this perpetual slow burn is never going to work itself out. Can only hope that a deal can be made with Israel to maintain reasonable restraint and maybe work with international peacekeepers to restore order.
They will. Israel has way more fire power.
They're probably going to respond to the death of a whole fuckload of innocents by killing a whole fuckload of innocents. They've already leveled a bunch of apartments.

">Hamas lashes out and a couple Israeli soldiers who signed up to kill Palestinians are killed, and it’s all over every news outlet across every western nation the next day.

That's not what is happening here and is a pretty disingenuous take on things which pretty much negates anything you stated earlier.

As for your comment about universities, the opposite is true, where Palestine supporters are openly vile and hateful, BDS are encouraged and normalized and even artwork depicting violence against Jews is praised and accepted.  Even further to this is our own government who employed an anti racist consultant who just happened to be a hateful anti-Semite.

At least the Gaza supporters are proud of their hatred of Jews, so why don't you just own your anti-Semitism."
"Interesting. That border expansion included leaving Gaza 18 years ago, right? So it's not about taking land and expanding as you tried to argue. The better question is why that didn't lead to peace, and instead led to more violence.

""Yet, even today we have news outlets peddling this clearly bias perspective, devoid from any truth or understanding of the conflict on the ground.""

I would love to hear what lies have occurred based on the current conflict of Hamas launching a terrorist attack against civilians.

""If you publicly question Israel’s position on this issue, you’re labelled an anti semite, even in University spaces where open critical discussions are meant to take place.""

You're joking. At a university we literally had a CUPE local tweet about how they're in solidarity with Palestine. They aren't afraid of it at all. In fact they proudly support Hamas and openly criticize Israel.

""Israel bombs a park literally full of children, no news coverage, basically nothing mentioned in popular media, except alt news sites like “Democracy Now!” Hamas lashes out and a couple Israeli soldiers who signed up to kill Palestinians are killed, and it’s all over every news outlet across every western nation the next day.""

You've got it backwards. Media isn't shy about calling out when Palestinians die. And it's a shame when it happens, to be clear. And also most article titles rarely point out when Israelis are killed, and won't point out it was by Palestinians."
"Except Israel has offered Gaza and the West Bank land for peace. Literally said you can have everything you want, at least 95% of it and all we want is a commitment to peace. 

Hamas and other Arab countries sent in a wave of suicide bombers the next day. 

Here’s the conflict summed up; One side wants the other dead, the other side wants peace."
"75 years of rape? Let's see videos of it. It's something Muslim, not Jewish"

Look at the history of Indian Independant and the partition of India into Pakistan and later Bangladesh, horrifying blood shed that resulted, far more then this massacre, were talking in the millions. This would be the fate of Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank if the seriously tried the two state solution. 

 No you should be pushing for a federal solution with citizenship and voting rights in Israel for folks of the West Bank and Gaza. Democracy is the civilized battlefield for Factions within a nation that keeps civil war at bay.

 You see this kind of violence here in Canada? No."

"The political left has been slowly replacing socialism with fascism as its core political doctrine over the past 50 years. It's hardly surprising that antisemitism has been rising.

And just as importantly, every innocent Israeli and tourist who was murdered, kidnapped and gd knows whatever else happened to them.    They did not deserve that.

It's time to destroy Hamas"
I don't think it's sunk in yet. My social media feeds are seeing some pretty awful takes from my progressive friends and acquaintances. There's a lot of moral relativism flying around.

I was neutral before. Past couple days has convinced me these actors are the same as ISIS.
77 % of Palestinians support Hamas. So I disagree.
"According to [the AP](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-middle-east-science-32095d8e1323fc1cad819c34da08fd87), as of 2021, more than half of Palestinians supported Hamas"
"As someone who sympathized with the Palestinians before this, the brutality of Hamas' attack against civilians really threw me onto Israel's side. I think tragically Hamas hurt the Palestinian message on the world stage for a generation, and it's tragic because a lot of the grievances of their citizens are legitimate too."
[removed]
Doubt it. There's been a deafening silence from Liberals on social media who usually jump at sharing flags of countries where there's been a brutal attack...
"No, they're not."
"In my eyes, Hamas and Palestine are the same. Palestinians majorly support Hamas. You support evil, you *are* evil. It's very simple."
"> A lot of more liberal minded pro-Palestinian people are going to chance their view after this week.

And why does that matter? Do you think Hamas cares what the rest of the world thinks? What happened yesterday has been happening to the Palestinians for decades tenfold in comparison to Israel. 

Israel is the superpower in this conflict and can solve this issue. Yet they have continued to keep Gaza as an open air prison. It's not complicated. End the apartheid."
"Nah. Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable. Every peaceful path towards peace, such as the BDS movement, numerous UN resolutions have been thwarted by the west. It’s sad that violence is seen by some as a victory, but what other path forward do Palestinians have?"
"Yep except that wasn't at all what it was. Check sources listed in other replies here. It was a hippie ""peace for the world"" thing, which yeah is just an excuse to get high and have fun but you know those people are not their enemy and never will be. They also knew they'd likely be unarmed, discombobulated and very little security staff if any. I can't help but think the Muslim hardliners also saw the sexual freedom there as somehow justifying their murder and rape. Just totally fucked up. Doesn't matter whT the festival was about no matter how dumb the reason. It's way dumber to murder those people ND not only doesn't help, actively fucks over thousands of families, including their own when all is said and done"

"They've always preferred to use Jews if possible. But in the absence of any convenient Jews, folks like Hamas have been more than happy to use Palestinians when push comes to shove."
Hamas has doomed the Gaza Strip. They gave Netanyahu justification to full send.
"Don’t fucking make this backhand comment. Don’t pretend Israel ever went and kidnapped children, and raped and paraded with their naked bodies in the streets. If you can’t stand up and say in isolation and without qualification that you are sickened and disgusted about what just took place you should be ashamed of yourself."
"Mad, sure. Barbaric? No"
"Poland has sent in a C-130H for evacuation purposes. Landing in Israel is fine.

It's all about what happens on the ground now. Israel has captured a Hamas leader, so maybe some sort of prisoner exchange. But with how radical Hamas is, idk if that actually happens.

Edit: Update relevant from Poland

[Polish President Duda authorises the deployment of the Polish Military Contingent, numbering 200 soldiers, to evacuate Polish citizens from Israel with the help of B-737, C-130 & C-295 aircraft. Poland is expected to use its Special Operations Forces in the operation](https://twitter.com/visegrad24/status/1711155097260917082?t=96n5mQc2DykRc5MUUEnCvQ&s=19)"

"I'll give you one guess where Hamas fires their rockets from.

Hint: it's not from farm fields

Are you referring to [this hospital that Hamas destroyed in Israel](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/video-shows-aftermath-of-israeli-hospital-hit-by-hamas-rocket-194673733798) or does that one not bother you as much?
"Maybe Hamas shouldn’t fire rockets from them in a deliberate attempt to put civilians in the line of fire? I know that sweet sweet propaganda of dead civilians is tough to resist — so many anti-semites fall for it every time, after all — but perhaps “militants” would be a tad more protective of their people if they were actually fighting for them. But they’re not. They just like Jew killing."
Apparently the building that we saw crumble recently on Reddit was from an attack in May by the IDF. I feel like it's going to much worse this time around.
"No. What Hamas did this time was not ""fighting an occupation"" and absolutely not a guaranteed human right. Their actions were a violation of international human rights law and humanitarian law."
"""Hamas is raping and murdering civilians but it's okay because Israel does cruel things too"""
"Do you think inviting a contest of strength was in the best interest of the Palestinians?

I don’t think it was. Curious to see what you think."

Yes, this is possibly planned escalation by the current axis powers to drain the west of resources in the same fashion we're draining Russia via hard slog in Ukraine."

LOL You mean they were willing to give back a tiny fraction of the land they literally stole via apartheid? Israel has done a great job killing civilians and stealing land for “peace”.

Yeah its the side that is a democratic country and isn't raping and murdering women in the streets.
You’d be surprised. Hence the protest we’re all commenting on.
"I am sorry but you need to google the history of this conflict. Palestinians have always been the first aggressors and always the first to spout rhetoric of exterminating the Jews since they were relocated there after the second world war. 

Everything Israel has done has been in retaliation to Palestines actions first.

Now yes, there have been moments in history where the Israel side has done unfavourable things but they do at least try to contain senseless acts and are nowhere near as bad as what the Palestinians do.

Seriously. Go google from 1947 onward for this conflict. Palestine had rhetoric to exterminate the jews from day pne."

"Maybe Canadians don’t like that immigrants won’t assimilate. I had a Chinese best friend all throughout elementary school, and then we went to a bigger highschool and she joined the “Asian clan” and never talked to me again. 

That’s obviously one, subjective experience, but it’s something I see time and time again. My friend from Dominican only wants to hang out with Dominicans, my Indian friends at school will only live with other Indians, and there’s a club for every single country that isn’t majority white (cause that would be racist /s). 

There’s an issue in Canada with immigrants only wanting to hangout with their “own” and continue living culturally the exact same. If that’s the case, then why come to Canada unless you want to benefit? And if you’re coming here to benefit, then maybe try to assimilate."
"Maybe you've painted a very self-focused view of Canada where it hates immigrants, but reality is immigrants in almost every other country get treated so much worse. Go ahead and name 5 countries where it's better to be an immigrant. I'll wait.

But news and Internet and Facebook will aggregate all the negative examples into one place so you can paint a convenient picture of Canadians actually being super hateful behind their ""nice facade"". Great way to tear down the people facilitating your arrival. 

Whatever makes you feel better about yourself? Canada, the most open and accepting country with the most pro-immigrant programs most pro-immigrant TV shows most immigrant everything, definitely hate immigrants yeah.

"What's insane is that Hamas haven't fundamentally changed. This is how Hamas has always been. The reason there haven't been massacres like this in recent years is because of the historical effectiveness of the Israeli security apparatus. These aren't freedom fighters, they're religious zealots and murderers.

Folks who have been siding with Hamas in the past were just incredibly ignorant.

Anybody looking at this who formerly took Hamas' side and are now realizing that they were wrong... needs to do a deeper examination about a lot of things, and consider the possibility that they were equally as misinformed on other major political issues."
"They always were. Israel has just been more effective at defending their people in the past.

Nobody informed on the Israel-Palestine conflict is surprised by this."
Right? I don't think you could get 77 percent of people to support free bacon cheeseburgers. 77 percent is about as strong as support gets unless it's North Korean election or something.
"Another comment linked a 2021 poll which said 53% of Palestinians support Hamas. It is a big number, but not an enormous majority, plus it was a couple years ago. Therefore, Palestinians ≠ Hamas."
Polling at gunpoint is not always reliable.
Why?
"You know this isn't new, right? This is how Hamas have always operated. Hamas have always been pro murdering Jews. They've just been unusually successful this time. 

They're literally Nazis.

Consider the possibility that your position on other major political issues comes from a similarly misinformed basis."
Have you not read about Hamas philosophy prior to this?
"I mean, Hamas's message has been some combination of ""Khaybar, Khaybar,"" ""Jews to the gas,"" and ""We will push them into the sea.""

Whole lot of people have been doing some Simone Biles level of mental gymnastics to make that out to be anything other than what we just saw."

"Really? Israel just went in for no reason and killed 600 Palestinian civilians?

Actually, no. Palestine has instigated every single conflict. 

They have been offered a two state solution for decades: they turn it down. Because they don’t want peace or a solution, they want nothing less than complete genocide of Israel.

Agree, end the apartheid. Gaza needs to allow full rights for non-Muslims and LGBTQ."
"Not raping, then murdering, then parading civilian women and children is *one* way forward."
"It's not edgy, it's called ""Being Informed"". I actually know what is going on in the conflict because I read about it from various sources with differing viewpoints and watch videos about it with the same discrimination. What I don't do is watch 3 minutes of a mainstream media propaganda network larping as a ""news"" site and make an emotions based opinion off that. Israel has committed countless atrocities against it's neighbors and has been central in destabilizing the Middle East to try to keep every nation around it engulfed in an internal civil war (Iraq, Syria, Lebanon). They've engineered ethnic cleansings and genocides (Sabra and Shatila massacres), they've bombed children, they've shot peaceful protesters (2018 Great March Of Return), they've starved mothers. What's happening to them right now is a fraction of the indiscriminate misery they've spread to every nation surrounding their colony.

If anyone has an actual counter argument refuting any of that instead of just regurgitating CNN talking points feel free to post it."
"They just bulldoze homes and uproot olive trees. Their soldiers just kill journalists and they don’t prosecute. They just control all trade, including the energy supply, to a giant ghetto. They just erect concrete barricades and separate roads.

Hamas is Hamas. Sadly for Palestinians their decision likely means the end of Gaza as we know it. Sadly for the Palestine project, this emboldens every conservative, reactionary and Zionist element in Israel. Things are now set back a decade or more. 

Hamas can justify it however they want, the more verified footage that emerges the more it’s clear their soldiers are simply on a rampage. This is not “a strike against the oppressor for freedom.” Fuck Hamas.

But everyone’s suddenly super quick to pretend that what’s happening justifies, legitimizes or minimizes what the State of Israel has done to average Palestinians for decades."
And they wonder why Israelis have such an intense security apparatus and separation

> Approximately 200 CAF members were on the ground in the region, in addition to members either serving onboard HMCS Montréal and its embarked CH-148 Cyclone helicopter, MV Astérix, and 2 CC-130J Hercules.

> Two CC-130J Hercules conducted a total of six flights out of Wadi Seidna Airbase north of Khartoum, evacuating over 530 people, including Canadian Entitled Persons (176 Canadian Citizens and Permanent Residents) and citizens of allied and like-minded nations.

We really need to start slowing down immigration and be more thoughtful about who we let in our country and how we ensure they are integrating into society (the first born generation is usually immediately integrated but the original immigrant requires more thoughtful engagement).

I know the above is a heated conversation but jesus… look at the numbers of people we now have advocating this kind of violence gleefully.

"Two things can be true at the same time. 

1) Hamas has committed a horrendous escalation that threatens to drag the world into armed conflict, and that cannot be supported in any way.

2) This situation is the inevitable outcome of 50y of a religiously motivated conflict that no one on either side ever really cared about resolving, and that was fueled by powerful foreign interests."
I’m starting to think there is a correct side now actually. Thanks. Not being sarcastic. Real talk.

"Exactly

CBC still hasn’t figured this out"
You are right that 77% number is taken from something else. So it's not 2/3rds it's just slightly over half. So I will agree with you. Thank you for bringing that to my attention
"It's less important what the polls say now or 2 years ago, it will matter what those polls say in 6 months"
Hey this bottle of wine that's only 53% sewage is totally drinkable!
"The number from last month shows 67% of Palestinians support “armed attacks against Israeli civilians inside Israel”. Meaning attacks like this. That poll shows the most popular presidential candidates are two members of Hamas, and one Palestinian in prison in Israel for orchestrating bombings that murdered at least 5 civilians…he was just a member of another separate group that Hamas absorbed.

The reason Palestinians don’t have higher support numbers for Hamas is because they support different terrorist groups too, like Islamic Jihad (who participated in yesterday’s massacres), PFLP, etc.

When you add them up, support is very high for genocidal terrorists. And for terrorism as a whole. Not every Palestinian is Hamas or even a terrorist, but unfortunately 2/3 of Gazans clearly support attacks like the one yesterday, and 54% do overall, while just 41% oppose those attacks. That’s an insane margin. 1 in every 2 Palestinians you meet in the West Bank or Gaza supports murdering civilians. Let that sink in."
Did you know they share a border with Egypt?
"welp tough shit for them, shouldn't of been born there"
"Hamas was democratically voted in. They literally voted for a terrorist group to run their government. Most Palestinians support them.

They were cheering and celebrating in the streets of Gaza after the civilians in Israel were killed."
I don't support people that vote for a Nazi party. Maybe you should reconsider whether you're as morally good as you think.
"My message is about how this makes the international community feel. You're right in that the IDF has  harassed Palestinians, and the Israeli settlements in the West Bank are unjust. But Hamas killing hundreds of innocent civilians, parading naked dead bodies around, killing and kidnapping citizens from all over the world is atrocious and way over the line. It silences all the people who've been advocating for Palestine. Freedom fighters don't kill innocent people, they gain the support of the populace. Look at India's independence, the end of apartheid, these are how justice is achieved, not slaughter of women and children."
At that point just glass both regions and call it a day
"It doesn't need to end with genocide. It needs to end with a quick beheading of their military and having their governement surrender.

Typical liberal. Just like the liberals saying Canada should have let the indigenous people starve to death when sir John a MacDonald was in power. *grabs bag of popcorn*
I wonder why
"3/4s of the people that Hamas killed were military. No one wants civilians to be killed. Israel has already killed at least 33 children in its response. 

> Actually, no. Palestine has instigated every single conflict.

Just remember, Israel created Hamas and has kept Palestinians in an open-air prison for a long time. Reverse the roles. Do you really think that it's surprising?"
I think the footage posted online by Hamas is about the strongest counter argument one could ask for.
"Actually no. Not unless they explicitly advocate for a full genocide against an entire group, they aren't. Talking positively about bad things isn't illegal, and good thing too. The government doesn't censor people like that. We have the benefit of living in a western country with good freedom of speech laws, and it's enshrined in our constitutional law as part of the charter of the rights and freedoms."

"Hate speech isn't just speech that is upsetting or angry or negative. In Canada, it requires very specific requirements in order to qualify.

It's just bone structure.
Hamas and Hezbollah's revolution's goal is for Jewish genocide. Israel has been quite good so far. They're surrounded by people who call for their total extinction and they only go in when they hear about immediate threats.
"The only people interested in genocide in the levant are Hamas. Anybody that supports Hamas supports genocide and holocaust. You know these fuckers' political and ideological antecedents literally sided with with Nazis and were big proponents of Hitler's final solution, right?

There's not many political issues in the world that are truly black and white but this is one of them. Don't be a fucking Nazi."
"Why would I support Turkey's treatment of Kurds? 

Are you that dense?"
"They literally can't, the US has to send even more military weapons to Israel, which they just announced, in a country with a modern economy. They can't even run their own concentration camps. Shows you how frail the settler-colonial state is. 

And what - they're not trying? The Gazans in a walled ghetto are still fighting, and are about to join up with the West Bank. 

Pathetic doesn't even begin to describe it."
"Israel fires back at the source of rocket fire. Hamas knows that. They still set up their rocket launchers in sensitive civilian areas to deter Israeli retaliation or to gain sympathy points after the fact. 

So please share what you would do if you knew a rocket launcher used to attack your city was still operational on top of a hospital."
"Here's Hamas putting a giant target on their fellow citizens, as they've done for decades out of densely populated areas..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_fP6mlNSK8

Of course, they don't have to be there, but it serves their purpose. 
This is what it looks like to have no regard for life.

Israel is literally the only country on the planet that can have its citizens mutilated raped tortured and taken hostage in a large coordinated attack and then get blamed for defending itself."
"Only because Hamas turns hospitals into weapons depots and launch silos.

Either you know that and you still support Hamas, or you don't and you're grossly misinformed on this issue. Either is a bad look. Honestly the first is a lot fucking worse. Hamas are fucking Nazis."
"The British had the land before.

"Instead of violence you could look toward peaceful resolutions. Unfortunately the PA turns down every peaceful offering.

Killing civilians doesn't end an occupation. Apparently Israel leaving Gaza didn't help either though. So occupation really isn't the problem either.

Once again you show your true colors, justifying and defending murdering civilians in a terrorist attack, trying to suggest they aren't civilians, and whataboutism because you truly can't defend the heinous acts of terrorists murdering civilians."

This isn’t Canadian exceptionalism. It’s about the extent to which CANSOF plans and trains. I don’t expect you to understand so just be quiet when the adults are talking.

"The 53% number was also taken from a poll in 2021 shortly after a conflict where hundreds of Palestinian civilians were killed and thousands wounded.  The same one where Israel bombed the media outlets offices and residential towers 10 minutes after sending a warning.  

Hamas does have a lot of support in Palestine but we don't know the real number."

"The last election in Palestine was 17 years ago.  Over 60% of the population is under 25.   

The latest poll I could find was 2021 and shortly after Israel bombed Gaza killing hundreds and wounding thousands more civilians.  The same conflict where they bombed all the news offices."
"This is a gross oversimplification of what would happen in that event. 

Look at Sri Lanka. Sinhalese-based government and wiped out the LTTE in a military blitz, but the Tamil people were persecuted afterwards still. Concentration camps and people getting disappeared still. And that’s in a country where it’s actually pretty segregated and there isn’t land disputes. 

The Israeli government will wipe out/displace all Palestinians from the disputed lands under the guise of “defending themselves” if they decided to do a full on attack"

The trucker convoy enters the chat. /s
They very may well be considering Hamas has openly stated they wish to carry out a genocide against all Jews
What about advocating for a group which advocates genocide? It certainly feels like that should fall under hate crime laws.
Hamas' goal is to kill all Jews on the planet.  Anyone celebrating or endorsing Hamas should be arrested and jailed.
Just like the truckers eh?

Damn, genocide AND holocaust! What else can your little brain muster? 

>You know these fuckers' political and ideological antecedents literally sided with with Nazis and were big proponents of Hitler's final solution, right?

If that argument doesn't work for Ukraine, it doesn't work for Palestine. You're so biased it's borderline delusional. 

>There's not many political issues in the world that are truly black and white but this is one of them. Don't be a fucking Nazi.

Nazis were Apartheid supporters, like your precious Israeli ultra right wing government. The difference between us is that I'm critical of both parties here while you're obviously an Israeli sycophant and by extension a supporter of Apartheid."
"The Kurds, the Palestinians, the Jews, the Iraqis, the Cypriots, the Greeks, and everyone else the Turks colonized for hundreds of years."
"Israel defeated 11 Arab nations at the same time. They have never lost a conflict to any of the Arab states. Look at the death toll for both corresponding sides from the conflicts. The casualties for Palestinians is ten fold what they are for Israelis.

Gaza was left to the Palestinians from Israel as charity. But this might be the end of Gaza once and for all. Israel has hinted that they are going to take full control of the territory. Time to end it for good."
"We shall see.

"Without international aid, clearly Israel can be driven back but not lose completely. With US and international unlimited arms supply, Israel comes out on top."
Do you? Or have you never used the internet to potentially look up anything useful in your life?
"And the bsbies, womem, children and old people with dementia that were killed repeatedly by Israel don't count in your book? 

Why weren't you weighing in on the matter when Palestinians were getting killed? Or do you reserve your anger and indignation for non-Arabs only?"
"Of course not, hamas has never done anything that benefits Palestine. 

That's not their purpose

If you look at their history and inception you'll see a long list of actions that have hurt any positive agenda for Palestinians. They're a proxy, who's proxy is the complicated question. 

The most blatant example of their intent is when they fought against Assad and Hezbollah in the Syrian Civil War.

The poll that was taken shortly after Israel killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians and still only showed 53% support?  That's not overwhelming.  

>How about the rallies in support happing in Canada right now?

What do rallies in Canada have to do with how many people in Palestine support Hamas?"
"This is why Ukraine jumped on the support train before even the US. When all is said and done, Israel will be supporting Ukraine which was sought after from day one. 

Oh, and the Gaza Strip plus Hezbollah controlled Lebanon will be reduced to rubble. Iran will have strikes against its missile/nuclear sites. 

Grab your popcorn."
I'm not suggesting they aren't good. What I'm suggesting is that you shouldn't assume any small group of special forces operators can be safely sent into a highly urban environment to fight against thousands of enemy combatants that are on alert.
"They are probably very good. But they aren’t invincible and would still suffer casualties if they went to Gaza. And the government is unwilling to suffer casualties. 
And practically, JTF2 needs to rely on a logistics tail from partners which is unavailable there. Israel is busy fighting a war and Israel is a long way for a chinook or griffon to fly from Petawawa."
"To think that Canadian forces could conduct ops in Gaza right now without sustaining casualties is jingoism or extreme arrogance. Likely both. 
Your living under a rock, keyboard warrior."
"Pretty simple really. Canadians value respect and coexistence. Supporting terrorism is not a Canadian value. Consequently, people supporting terrorism are not exhibiting Canadian values..."
"So is it okay to target civilians who voted for a government that has oppressive or dictatorial policy?  If you think so, I feel like Hamas would agree with you on that.

On the topic of elections - are you aware that the last election in Gaza was in 2006?  There have been no elections since then.  Voting age is 18, and this was 17 years ago.  Anyone younger than 35 has never had a say in this - and people younger than 17 were born into it.  Do you know what proportion of the population of the Gaza Strip is younger than 35?  It is well over 50%.

No matter how you look at this action, it is a medieval siege and retributive massacre that threatens well over a million innocent people that have been locked in an open-air prison for almost 75y.

There can be no doubt that what happened to Israel was horrendous.  Hamas knew what they were doing.  Their actions were monstrous.  And Israel is in danger of becoming monstrous as well.  ""They made us do it"" never ages well."
"Yes, there are numerous videos. Why are you skeptical about this? You think people who mass murder people at a concert would find rape ungentlemanly behaviour or something?"

I specifically said child and kid weren't equivalent terms.
This page is a goldmine for all the “I’m not a racist but” types
"What do you feel about 67% of Gazans supporting “armed attacks against Israeli civilians inside Israel”?

To be clear, I am not suggesting there is no innocent Gazan or that all Gazans should die. But consider that number above. I’m curious for your thoughts. The reason a number about Hamas is misleading is because there are other genocidal groups exactly like it that take some support, like Islamic Jihad which participated in the attack on Israel. So if support is 53% for Hamas, it may be 24% for Islamic Jihad (as a random number), meaning 77% support for genocidal terrorist groups that are *like* Hamas even if they go by a different name."
"Fair, but no. i did mean the governement. Anyone not completly insane would never want civilian population wiped. That's barbaric and insane."
"In our laws, somebody being happy that Hamas has done something bad isn't illegal. If they themselves were Hamas members, or they explicitly stated that they want genocide, it might be. But advocating for the actions of a group isn't illegal unless the specific action you're advocating for is genocide. For example, you could advocate for the fact that Serbia was nationalist in the early 2000's, as long as you don't explicitly state that you want them to commit genocide."
"It doesn't, and it never has. I'm sorry that us living in a free society is so inconvenient for you."
"What? We might not Hamas for their methods and goals, but that doesn't mean we can just make things up about them. They absolutely do not want to kill every Jew on the planet. Where the hell did you get that from?"
"The truckers weren't dispersed for what they were saying, else it would have happened a lot sooner. They were dispersed because there were other unrelated issues and crimes, like occupying public land without the right paperwork to do that. If these people started worshipping the actions of Hamas, it wouldn't be illegal, and then if they did that while shutting down downtown Ottawa, it would be."

Totally agree with that. But referring to any human as a “person” isn’t reflective of those values . Nor is suggesting that theyre not truly citizens
These psychos are ok w murder but rape is a bridge too far apparently
Maybe you should learn more about the conflict if you think you can just remove Hamas and have their government surrender with precision.
"Serbian Canadian here

We can debate how strict we should be about immigrants entering Canada, and we can definitely disagree with the opinions that some immigrants have on world affairs

That does not mean we should lose sight of the fact that the ability for immigrants to express controversial opinions is a pillar that elevates Canada as a society

From my experience as a diaspora kid, I think immigrants have an intense survivor’s guilt about leaving their country that amplifies their nationalistic tendencies. That’s how you get situations in Turkey where Erdogan has negligible advantages in popular support domestically but massive voter support in Germany, etc. I think the gold standard for immigrants is to recognize that your family moving abroad is tacit acknowledgement that “your side” in your country’s geopolitical affairs is nowhere near as sound or logical as your mother state’s propaganda wants you to believe, and recognizing that your new neighbours often don’t care or intensely disagree with you. You yourself have to square with why that might be"
"Thats the thing though, what Hamas is doing in Israel right now could be classed as an attempted genocide as evidenced by their stated goals and their current actions towards Israeli citizens (brazen rape and murder.). I would argue anyone who looks at that and sees it as a good thing would more than likely advocate for the genocide of the Jewish people of Israel. Whether its illegal or not, I don’t know but it shouldn’t be condoned or tolerated and these people should be at the very least shamed and outed for their despicable beliefs."
"If they were Hamas members it would be illegal, correct. I agree with what you say about free speech, we don't want to prevent it (just like it's OK to mock religion symbols/prophets here), but at the same time these are highly emotional and volatile religon/regional protests that might not be as common in Canada as they are in other places these days and it's best to have police presense as things can get out of hand very quickly (by both sides, you equally don't want Anti-Hamas protesters attacking). It's OK to be right, it's better to be right and smart.

On a personal level, I will never understand people that are pro-terrorism, but maybe it's best to have them in the open than behind closed doors."
"WTF?  YES THEY DO.  They directly say that is their plan.  Why the hell are you talking if you don't know such basic information?  

And you cant' be defending Hamas or Palestinians right now.  THat's disgusting."

Now add on that a lot of people in that region would rather die than be dishonored because of religious beliefs about an afterlife, and you can't at all be surprised with how things are shaping up.

Yeah idk why I'm getting downvoted for saying that it isn't illegal for these people to say what they're saying.
I'm not saying it should be condoned or free of consequences. I'm saying it's not illegal.
"Yeah a few of my comments saying ""they suck but until they do something illegal, we aren't going to disperse their protests. We have rights, and they apply to the idiots too"" have gotten VERY negative reactions from people acting like these guys are just inherently illegal because of what they're saying, as if we don't have free speech in Canada."
"I'm literally not defending them. I've actively said multiple times that if it were up to me, their supporters in Canada wouldn't be able to stay here. 

But where the absolute fuck have you seen them say that their goal is to kill every Jew on earth? Because unless you're under the impression that Israel has all the Jews, this is not something they've ever said"
"Of course they will cause more violence - no one is doubting that. But the costs to the settler-colonial state will continue mounting - more guns, less butter. This is how you defeat settler-colonialism, from Haiti to Vietnam. 

And just like the French or Americans couldn't destroy the Viet Cong, so the Zionists will not be able to destroy the Palestinians fighting for their liberation. They will continue coming.

After so much losing, you would think they would learn to stop instigating wars and try to negotiate peace, but they don’t seem to learn.

Gaza probability won’t exist after this. Israel has said they will take full control of Gaza. After that, they will dismantle all of their government and maybe even just bulldoze the whole place for new settlements. And no doubt the terrorists and their supporters will cry victim."

She was not killed in the Israel-Hamas conflict, she was brutally murdered by terrorists.

She was targeted. She was murdered."

The situation is terrible for all involved.  But when one group asks for all supporters worldwide to kill kill kill in whatever country they are in then that group needs to cease to exist.  I don't think they actually said kill but words to that effect.

"Utterly tragic. I cannot believe her life was taken when she was so young, in such a brutal manner.

I went to say my condolences on a memorial post her family posted for her on social media, and there were Canadians, living in our country, actively saying things like, ""So? Kids are dying every second in Gaza, perpetuated by people like her. She can go to hell.""

I just cannot imagine the depravity of writing that, KNOWING that a family that is grieving will read something so heinous and vile.

We need to examine the values of some of our citizens, because on some things, like grieving the loss of a young person, there is SIMPLY right and wrong, and no blurred line in between. I don't give a fuck your political cause; you either say your condolences, or you shut the fuck up if you've got some vested interest in politicizing her death and spitting on her grave.

May her soul rest in peace, and may her family heal in due time. I hope that her memory will be a comfort to her loved ones. I hope that the hope espoused in the festival she was attending spreads far and wide."

"1. Israel chose to ignore intelligence from Egyptian officials about a major attack coming from Hamas.

2. According to several Israelis, experts on security/political matters relating to Israel and even former IDF soldiers, the Israeli border fence/region is heavily protected & surveilled. Some have suggested that not even a cockroach or fox could enter without them knowing. Yet somehow 1,500+ Hamas fighters, heavy equipment like bulldozers and tons of vehicles were able to slip through completely unnoticed.

3. Israel & Gaza are amongst the most surveilled places on the planet. Israel dedicates a lot of time and effort upon surveillance and security. They are very security conscious. They have Gaza mapped out and under constant surveillance with highly advanced tech including a giant surveillance balloon, surveillance drones, satellites, etc.

4. Israel collaborates with Echelon & NATO. Chiefly amongst these groups, Israel has very close intel ties with the US which has eyes throughout the ME. 

5. Israel has one of the largest and most sophisticated spy networks in the world penetrating multiple enemy & even friendly nations with its spies/double agents.

6. Hamas is said to have been training for the attacks at a mock Israeli settlement near the Israeli-Gaza border region & Israel was aware of this.

7. We just watched unsophisticated terrorists on hang gliders soar into one of the most heavily-defended & surveilled countries on the planet. The original Israeli response to the attack was very muted. Where were the border guards? Where was the police? Where was the IDF? How was Hamas able to act so freely in Southern Israel for so long & penetrate deep into Israeli territory? Even Hamas was surprised by how easy it was and how successful their operation was.

8. Within 48 hours of the attack, we’re now suddenly seeing enormous support for an American war with Iran and the genocide of the Palestinian people. Food/water/electricity cut - full on genocide. Now we are moving to war with Iran. 

9. Hamas was allegedly planning this attack for many months if not longer and we are expected to believe that Israel knew nothing about it this whole time.

10. This attack was allowed to happen.

But all the comments her show either incredible amount of bias or complete ignorance.

We have more important fish to fry at home. I'd pull all funding except for direct humanitarian aid and trying to withdraw any Canadians that are interested in leaving. Gaza or Isreal.

Edit: I'm disgusted frankly by how many people are actively supporting carpet bombing civilians.

Just a fact of life for the region. Innocent civilians have been getting killed on both sides for decades. Blame their leaders and military who are degenerate scum.

"Palestine people in Gaza trapped in fence and even on the ocean side. There is line in the ocean as well. If you go over invisible line in the sea, Israeli military will shoot you without warning, no way to escape but Egypt. That's what Isreal want, complete take over the land in inhumane way for past 50 years. That's why recent big attack from Hamas has started as stated.by Hamas official. I'm not defending anyone but seeing the situation from outsider. Yet someone make an article about young girl from Can-Isreal dies, it is a big deal? What if Palestine people fenced Jews around and kill them if they see Jews try to escape? It is eye opening moment for me when I realize Palestine people living inside the fence like a farm animal. That was the moment where I understand why this conflict will never end until oneside collapse completely... I hate to see this happen, I thought human can co-exist happily together under any circumstances but we are not far from animals."
Turning off seeing upvotes and downvotes is such a cowardice thing to do. It gives me the impression you’re expecting nuance in something pretty black and white.
"Israel and Palestine both have committed major war crimes against each other. Right now, though, it's Palestine in the wrong. Sure, they want their freedom; that's understandable. But killing civilians and children isn't the way to do it. So right now, anyone supporting Palestine in their attack is in the wrong."

She did nothing wrong and has died as a result of a terrorist attack. It baffles me why our government is not taking a stronger stand against these extremists. 

Surely the federal government can find a way to ensure the safety of Canadians both in Canada and abroad from those who support Hamas. There is no excuse for what Hamas has done and we should be presenting a strong message to them that this is not acceptable instead of allowing huge gatherings of ""supporters"" of Hamas to occur."
I’m assuming the other 3 killed were Palestinian-Canadians so no one actually cares.. right?

"No one wants to accept the reality of the measures that have to be taken to stop this. People want to cry about not working hard enough for a two state system, blissfully unaware that the Hamas doctrine clearly states that all of Israel is there's and jihad is the only way to settle it. Westerners want to apply rational thoughts to irrational people. They can't fathom the lives of people who will happily die for their religious beliefs. To Hamas every Palestinian that dies in this will go straight to heaven. They aren't just telling them to stay because they want human shields, most of them think that by resisting and dying in the name of Allah is a one way ticket up. Israel is not without fault for sure and they also have mentalities that can't be fully understood by westerners. Either way, the situation is so complex there is no clean solution. There are definitely civilian Palestinians caught up in this and it's horrible, but a lot of those civilians fully support Hamas and what they do to Israeli civilians. This makes it incredibly hard to do this in any way that is not atrocious. 

At the end of the day Hamas is an evil, radical terrorist organization that beheads and burns babies, rapes and murders women and then has the gall to blame it on their own civilians. Last I checked I don't remember the IDK doing such things and that should be enough for people to at least somewhat grasp why Israel is reacting how it is and see the truth of that sad state of manipulation that the Palestinians have been under for almost 20 years. Instead westerners want to get out and act virtuous as if they know the answers to fix it and how dare they not just accept each other. Must be nice to go through life having all the answers."
Multiculturalism has failed and this is proof. Integration is necessary.
All those people need to be videotaped and identified so they can be watched 24/7.  We can't let terrorism spread in Canada.
That’s fucking disgusting. Was there coverage of this? Is there a source?
"I view it as people’s true colours. Anti-Semitism is obviously alive and well in the west. The left has always aligned with anti-Semitic views and as the left dominates public discourse and cancel culture - is it any wonder we have seen repellent behaviour - condoning the savage murder of innocents- butchered and defiled bodies - throughout the west. They weren’t just collateral damage. Plans on dead Hamas showed that children were the top targets. Instructions were to kill anything that moves. But what they also did was defile bodies. Cut parts off, behead children, burn babies, rape women on the top of the bodies of their friends before killing them, putting the eyes out with rods and much worse. This systematic barbaric behaviour is beyond belief. Anyone that supports Hamas supports this. And they expose who they are. We should never forget who they are."

"I don’t support Hamas, but I support Palestine . Without using violence as a means , and through civil actions , they would have been fine .it’s like if Russia invaded ukraine and ukraine formed a extremism organization to get back at Russia"
"Are you referring to people who actually support Hamas?

Or are you suggesting that any criticism of Israel's response is ""supporting Hamas""? 

I ask because I most certainly do NOT support what happened last weekend. But I get told I support Hamas when I express outrage about Israel's ongoing violence towards Palestinians.

Anticolonialism is not antisemitism."
"As a person that supports Palestine but not Hammas, I dont understand how some peopl support Israel. But they do."
"Some people support Israel too, lots of crazies"
People threw their moral compass out the window. What has society come to?
"For academic and journalistic purposes, ""conflict"" and ""war"" mean two separate things. There might not have been a declared *war* at the time, but the broader Israeli-Palestine *conflict* has been ongoing since 1948, and the Israeli-*Hamas* conflict has been ongoing since 2005. There's been no year in this timeframe without hundreds or even thousands of casualties."
">  that she was unfortunate collateral damage.

I really, really dislike this term ""collateral damage"".  

No, she was not any such thing.  No murdered person is.

Just as the Gazan children being killed now are not ""collateral""."
"Did you just ignore all the other parts of the article? It's not like they ignored that fact, it was stated several times throughout...

>since Hamas militants ambushed a music festival in southern Israel

>went missing after the militant group attacked the music festival

The total number of Canadians killed in the overall situation is 4, that's why it's stated that way. Insane people try to nitpick it so hard and then ignore the whole article."
Couldn’t agree more.
For the sake of journalist integrity I’ll scream this into the void: The article doesn’t state how she died. There’s a good chance they might not know so making a hard claim would be bias reporting. There’s a possibility she was murdered by Hamas but she also could have been killed during Israel’s bombing of Gaza which would make her part of Israel’s collateral damage.
"My thoughts exactly when I read that.

Terrorists used paragliders to mass-murder hundreds of young people at a concert. It's perverse to say that she ""died in the Israel-Hamas conflict."""
100%
"Here is the very first sentence in the article:

>The family of a Canadian Israeli woman, who was missing since Hamas militants ambushed a music festival in southern Israel last Saturday, says she has died.

Is that clear enough for you?"
This is absolutely a continued conflict. 75 years old.
yeah that is super fucked up phrasing by the CBC
“before any reinstatement of conflict had been established”? You missed the last decade of history in Israel / Palestine I see lmao
"Why make this the focus? Is there something to be gained by not referring to hamas crossing into Israel and shooting people based on them being jewish? sounds like more than murder, no?"
You are right. This is how everyone gets turned into a statistic. It is a deliberate attempt to cover it up as part of the larger issue.
"Hamas is not a ""militant group"", they are an elected government.  The majority of Palestinians voted for them.  What Hamas did was war crimes and part of the Hamas program.  The Charter of Hamas stated exactly what they planned to execute and was known to Palestinians.

Similarly for Israelis, they know what their government does and they vote for it."
"It was a terrorist attack and it also WAS during a continued conflict. Gaza is an open-air prison where the Israeli government has been restricting movement, seizing assets and committing human rights abuses for decades. 

Both can be (and are) true.

And before you go feral on me: Yes, Israel has a right to defend itself and Hamas needs to be eradicated. Killing Palestinian civilians is not the way to do that, however."
"This is most definitely a continued and ongoing conflict that has been going on for decades.  This was the latest flare up.  And leading up to this the extreme right Israeli government has killed at least one civilian a day this year so far.  Not to mention they have blockaded the Palestinian population controlling every aspect of their lives and ensuring abject poverty indefinitely.
So ya, you got two terrorist organizations at play here victimizing civilians.  You can't hope to understand the full complexity of this conflict just by reading and reacting to headlines on Reddit."
"When both sides are filled with terrorist militants who kill innocent civilians, it makes sense to just call it a conflict"
are you implying there was no ongoing conflict prior to oct 7?
"Murdered by Hamas, a group elected by the Palestine people. A group allowed to operate in Palestine, by the Palestine people."
Yea history started last week and Gaza hasn’t been under a siege by an apartheid regime for decades. Wonder what caused these guys to get so extreme to be able to commit atrocities.
So what are we going to describe the Israeli government with their current genocide on Palestinians?
"Sucks that the IDF used the crowd as cover while firing at insurgents, then. If it’s murder, then it’s on the brutal occupiers."
"Well said, this is legit issue need to be addressed like words are able to tilt facts so one should be careful while using them."
"Yeah Israel’s actions had absolutely nothing to do with why hamas was there…

Fucking moron"
"And it's not the ""Israel-Hamas conflict"" it's the ""Israel-People of Gaza"" conflict."
"CBC bending the narrative so that Canadians aren't too emotional about anything these days. ""Neutrality"" and we all wonder why there's inaction in this country."
"In hindsight attending a rave a few kilometres from a concentration camp wasn’t a good idea. Before anyone misunderstands, I’m absolutely NOT blaming this poor girl - i do feel however that western governments bear some responsibility. Israel is a vicious colonial-settler apartheid state. Having normalised relations with Israel gives people a false impression of what is really happening there - and the risks of visiting. Supposedly civilised nations should by now have sanctions on Israel rather than this “we stand with Israel” BS."
"I will fight for the right of anyone to march for whatever they want. That said, the level of disgust I feel for those taking joy in this terrorist attack I can’t even describe."
"For real. Where is all the ""Hatred has no home"" brigading?"
"> in favour of her killers across Canada. Universities across Canada support her killer

Universities do not. You could read the statements they're actually putting out."
No people are protesting because israel is committing genocide and killed orders of magnitude more people both before and after this attack. People are not celebrating hamas’s attacks. Or does that not matter to you when the victims aren’t white?
"I’m rly confused by this because all the protests I’ve been are not celebrating Hamas. Could you send me some links of photos of the protest where people are happy and supporting Hamas? From what I’ve seen, the protests are about freeing Palestine from Israel’s land theft of their homes, economy, and right to freedom. Palestinians are persecuted for being Palestinians and aren’t even allowed to use certain roads. There’s military checkpoints where their faces are scanned and cctvs everywhere to monitor their every move. There’s so much documentation of the Israeli army executing children and teenagers and arresting them in the middle of the night"

"Its unbelievable that people think they are supporting social justice by supporting TERRORISTS who have no intention for peace.

If you want a conversation about Israel and the Palestinians in the West Bank, sure. But Hamas is literally using children as human shields and telling their own people to ignore bombing warnings. What are we talking about here."

"Yea that must mean cbc supports Hamas... Y'all be reaching for outrage at every opportunity. Call your tits, CBC is not condoning Hamas"
"That's because they don't use the word to describe any group as media is supposed to be non bias. 

A media literate person would know this."
Hamas' western supporters are the same people who love to post online about punching Nazis.
"This is so disingenuous, Hamas was voted in a singular time and it was after Israeli unilaterally pulled out of Gaza without consulting with the PA whatsoever. So Hamas turned around and said ""we made this happen, all the negotiations of the past decade didn't"" and people supported the IDF leaving. There hasn't been a single election held there since as Hamas has is in essence a military dictatorship. There isn't rallies against Hamas because people in Gaza are terrified of them. Look at any polling of Gazans, going back well over a decade even, and if there was an election held at any point Hamas would not have won. Gazans support the PA taking administrative control, Hamas disarming and the vast majority support a secularist over Hamas. So no, it's not disingenuous to act like that, and it's disingenuous to just make shit up which contradicts all available facts on the matter."
It should also be noted that[ Israel supported Hamas as well](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-11/ty-article/.premium/netanyahu-needed-a-strong-hamas/0000018b-1e9f-d47b-a7fb-bfdfd8f30000). They calculated that Hamas being in power would hurt the chances of Palestinian statehood.
"This logic of collective punishment and responsibility can be, and is, used just as validly to justify the terrorist attacks on Israel."
“Why don’t Afghan women rally against the Taliban?”
"They've been in power for that 17 years after being elected once, it's disingenuous to imply there's a democratic mandate.

What do you think Hamas would do to anyone attempting to organize a rally against them in Gaza?"
People here too lazy to get rid of people like Doug Ford through voting and you want randoms across the planet to spill blood because that's what the rallies would do.
They're literally in the streets telling us what they are. Just take this opportunity to deport all of them
"Why do people post shit like this? I mean, surely you know it’s not true, so why do you post it? They are marching in support of the innocent Palestinian men, women, and children being deliberately massacred right now."
That’s disgusting.
Sickening
"What a stupid comment, you claim every liberal feels that way and then state you are also a liberal."
"I initially thought the protests were just people advocating for civilians in Gaza, but some of the banners and quotes from protesters stating the attack was justified are fucking insane.

Take solace in the fact that Israel is going to fuck Hamas up, and Canadians have provided a lot of military aid to Israel."
"Yeah, people saying it's a good thing that Canada sends Israel so much military aid. They should just move to a country like Israel where they can play apartheid and kill people since they're so desperate to be a hero and shoot kids."
User name definitely does NOT check out on this one. Endeavour to grow and learn every day. The world isn't as simple as you think it is.
Maybe because every time they get out they try and kill their neighbors.

Not just to dance and have fun either. The festival was one of peace. Of a belief in an end to the violence. All for it to end in this. Devastating.
"A ""concentration"" camp where they somehow get weapons and rockets to fire at their oPresSsors and have rapists and murdering scum cheered through the streets when they parade bodies of foreign women"
"Across all the terrorist attacks by Hamas on that day, 1,300 people were murdered.

There's a reason Israel is calling this their 9/11."
The fucked up thing is that this was a music festival to celebrate peace
Not that it changes anything but the German woman in the back of the truck was 30. Still a fucking travesty.

"Gaza hasn't been occupied since 2005.

The rest of your comment is just too pathetic to even address. When you grow up I hope you learn some compassion."
"The replies to this comment just showcase my point.

Mentioning Zionism, a vague definition of a belief of sovereign right to land that's view differently across an entire population is somehow justification for Hamas.

A Washington Post article about Israel creating Hamas? How can you possibly believe any modern news outlet? The all have political bias at this point. Even if the Israeli government did, that still doesn't justify killing so many civilians, just like the deaths on 9/11 was not justified.

Also, everyone is fine talking about Hamas wanting to eradicate Israel, but then want to use the analogy of Israel wanting to eradicate Palestine, not Hamas. So the bias is that Israel wants to eradicate ALL of the Palestinian people, whereas it's only Hamas that wants the Israelis gone, not the Palestinians.

I would love to hear all your ideas for a solution, what is it  YOU believe will end this conflict the way you think it should be? It seems like you think if Israel just stood down, took their hits and stopped being a bully then everything would be peachy.

The reality is this, unless every person in Israel packs up and leaves and relinquishes the entire country, this will never end, period. Are you all saying you are okay with this?"
"> At the end of the day Hamas is an evil, radical terrorist organization

...that was created by Israel in order to fracture the Palestinian opposition and put an Islamist face on it for the world.  Just look at how differently Israel treats Gaza over West Bank (where Fatah is in control) where they let settlers keep encroaching and stealing and the IDF keeps bulldozing communities.

You really need to look into what Zionism is. Google the Lehi. There are no good guys here.
"I am so tired of hearing that Hamas wants to eradicate Israel with zero acknowledgement that Israel wants to eradicate Palestine.  ""They hate us"" I hear, from people who also claim that Palestinians don't love their children.  ""They want to push us into the sea"" I hear, from people who support ongoing illegal encroachment on Palestinian land.

The hate goes both ways, and there will never be peace unless both sides are willing to share."
The words Diversity and Division come from the same root
"No mainstream media coverage of it, just videos on social media from the demonstration. Linked it in a reply to someone else."
"Plenty of videos were posted on sociap media platforms at the time it was happening, and the media didn't report on those because it didn't fit the mainstream narrative of ""freedom convoy = nazi movement"". Not hard to search for it as long as they haven't been forcibly taken down.

If anything the media is biased in favour of Israel. I say this as someone who supports Israel's right to defend itself.

I watched them interview the IDF spokesman last night and it was semi-enraging. It's not often I feel bad for a military spokesman. I wasn't convinced before but now am leaning towards defunding them.
Expect nothing less from them. They’re moving towards full equivocation.
The majority of Palestinians are under the age of 18 and didn't vote in the last election that took place in 2006.
Sure. In the same way the north Koreans voted for Kim Jong un.
"1.9 million Palestinians voted for them. Not a majority. Enough to be elected in 2007, but not a majority."
Atrocious no matter how you look at it but what elected government ever hasn’t committed war crimes?
In 2014- no elections since 2014. 9 years ago and the average age in Gaza is 18. So none of those people who were children at the time voted for them. Hamas is not a government it is a terrorist group sponsored by Iran holding the 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza hostage.
"I think they received a plurality, but not a majority. 17 years ago..."
"Why no mention of Egypt's role in it being ""an open air prison""?"
The Israeli state isn’t a terrorist organization. Anyone who tries to equate the two parties immediately cedes their credibility on this issue.

"Ya and history started in 2005 when Gaza was handed over willingly, never mind Palestinians refusing peace and calling for genocide for over 50 years before that, or their leaderships role in the holocaust.  I’m sure the Jews have all forgotten the holocaust right?

Haj Amin al Huseyni wasn’t helping in Hitler’s final
Solution and watching Jews suffer and die touring around the concentration camps because Israel existed.

The very same leader who then kept calling for genocide and refusing all peace and attacking Israel the first few decades of the conflict.

But ya just draw an arbitrary line in history wherever it suits you to build your false narrative of an infantilized Palestine that literally never existed for even a day."
Enough with the apologism for an overt act of terror carried out by a group whose manifesto outright calls for Jewish genocide.

How come nobody protests against Egypt for keeping their boarders closed off, or how no other neighboring muslim countries want the refugees either? You should look into why that is. Israel are not the ""good guys"" here, but this conflict didn't happen overnight and has been going on longer than either of us have been alive with massive atrocities committed by both sides going back generations which has lead to our current day situation which has no easy answers or solutions.  

While I don't know if how Israel responded was the right thing to do, if they were committing genocide they would just do it, they wouldn't bother telling civilians to evacuate, do roof knocking, or trying to organize a passage out. But Hamas tells them to stay put because they are the ones who use their citizens as human shields."
"If they wanted to commit genocide it would have been done.  Gaza could have been wiped off the planet when there were zero hostages over the last decades.  

Only one side of this war has an actual charter that explicitly calls for the death of all Jews not only in Israel but across the world."
"As an Israeli Arab , can you explain to me how is it genocide? When the Gaza population and the Palestinian population has been the rise since 1948 that never have been any kind of decrease! Like why you all keep lying?"

Are they protesting Hamas?
"Bibi, not Israel as a whole. Bibi is kind of a complete asshole. There have been mass protests against him and he is heading towards a humiliating defeat in the next election."
"Israel did support Hamas and Netanyahu was involved. But this was in the 70's, and they did this because the founder of Hamas opposed the PLO, which was the primary militant threat to Israel at the time. Back then, Hamas didn’t have well-trained militants, hence Israel didn’t see them as an existential threat."

This too is a false generalization. Nuance and sense is lost in people’s entrenched, polarized views, and the truth is obscured."
"Deliberately massacred?! Are we living in different realities?

Hamas has literally deliberately massacred 1000+ people and taking 100+ people hostage. Israel is responding to that. 

It has declared war and preparing to invade, while giving advance warning to Palestinians in Gaza prior to bombing. Unlike the openly stated charter of Hamas, Israel has never had a policy to exterminate or massacre Palestinians.

Hamas is wholly responsible. There was no scenario where Israel would not have reacted to the biggest attack on its soil, and Hamas knew that very well, and still decided on behalf of all Gazans that it’s a sacrifice worth making. 

Also, if you haven’t been paying attention, the marchers in support of Palestine quite clearly had people celebrating Hamas’s massacre. The complete silence from the organizers of these marchers to denounce Hamas is very telling."
The protests can’t stop what is going to happen.  Shocked pikachu faces incoming.
"Finally decides to fight back? What was their military objective again? To murder concert goers, rape women, murder and abduct children and the elderly…. And then just head back into gaza.

Being murdered by terrorists is anything but a ""travesty"".  

People seem to think that the word ""travesty"" is interchangeable with ""tragedy"", as if the two words mean roughly the same thing... and that's just completely wrong.

"no I did not say that. I said that is basically what happened with Russia/ukraine as an example, and I don't support Hamas. People are acting like Israel did nothing wrong, and supporting Palestine is a terrible thing. The generations of Palestines who had their land become occupied through coercion and bloodshed is the reason why Hamas exists. It is wrong they go to extreme measures, but Israel is the reason they do. It is unfortunate that innocent civilians are caught in the middle of this, from both sides. Just as Israel lost citizens, Palestine citizens have had murder at the hands of Israel just as much, if not more."
">as the terrorist attack was known

...we all knew what was coming for Gaza.  

When 9/11 happened, we at least had a few days to consider the horror and sadness before we knew where and who would feel the brunt of the USA's [unfair] 'retaliation'.  

When news of last weekend broke, we all knew immediately what was coming next.   So it should not be surprising that there were immediate demonstrations in support of the people who were going to suffer the wrath of the IDF."
"Yeah, it's probably wrong, I'm sure lots more Canadians have died since 2005 in the conflict."
"No, they are innocents, dead because Israel uses that as an excuse to drop bombs on people who had nothing to do with what happened last weekend.  When you set out to 'mow the lawn', you intend to cut all the grass, not just the weeds."
"This sophistry by which we all know that Israel will kill many thousands of innocents in Gaza - will deliberately drop bombs, and cut off power, food, and water - but we aren't allowed to call their actions ""deliberate"", appalls me.

Israel bears the moral weight of its own actions."
"I'm not going to edit the article quotes. I don't disagree they are terrorists, but media very rarely will call any group terrorists."
It is a common practice for many major publications to not use the word terrorist.
"That's not what OP was raging about at all, if it was they certainly were not clear about. They identified a different aspect which ignored other parts of the article.

And as noted elsewhere it's standard for media to not use the word terrorist."
"Terrorist is easily the more politicized word. Your definition is something you've drawn lines on outside of what you want to admit. When the US government bombs civilians in the Middle East we don't call them terrorists. Terrorist is a loaded term used by western politicians and biased media to evoke fearful reactions. In casual conversation it can be used without much issue. I would certainly use the word terrorist to describe the Hamas militants. *However*, it is NOT the job of any journal or newspaper to inform us what conclusions to make about an incident unless the piece is explicitly an opinion piece. A good news source uses objective language and facts and allows you to draw your own conclusions from that. People love to rant and rave about media bias and indoctrination or whatever but then those same people turn around and demand biased media to fit their narrative aims.

""Terrorists Brutally Murder Canadian Citizen In Cold Blood"" would be the news trying to tell you what to think about this. *I* could (and would) summarize this incident for you in that way. But what I, an everyday layman on the street, and the media, a professional organzation committed to fact-finding, are allowed to reasonably say are very different things."

I think it's been clear that all main news organizations are doing this.
I don’t want to push to hard because I know times are tough but this article also doesn’t make a hard claim on her cause of death and parrots the wording used by the article above. They do report a 2nd hand (a family member hearing from another family member) or possibly a 3rd hand (a family member hearing from another family hearing most likely the Israeli gov) that she was killed by hamas. I think objectively this is not a very strong source and I do still feel it should be independently verified before they make a hard claim.
"Actually, CBC ground crews in Israel have shown millions of Canadians what Hamas had perpetrated last week. I fail to see where they've been 'light-handed'. 

You're also not going to see the word ""terrorist"" from any major publication (CBC, BBC, Reuters, CNN) for any story. You can agree or disagree with the policy, but it's been that way for decades; it's not like they've made some exception for Hamas."
It is a common practice for many major publications to not use the word terrorist.
"It says it under Public Safety Canada and the Anti-terrorism Act but CBC is selective. A quick search of recent CBC articles does show the use of the word terrorist and terrorism. When it comes to Israel and Arab foreign affairs it's not ""terrorism."""
CBC isn’t obliged to use definitions set by the government.
That’s 100% true!  Why is CBC calling them militants?!  They decapitated babies!  I have seen the proof.  It’s unthinkable that any human would do such a thing.
"I'm trying to say that that contrary to what OP was implying, the article is unambiguous in stating that it was Hamas which was responsible for this poor young woman's death."
"You are not going to see the word ""terrorist"" in any major publication (CBC, BBC, Reuters, CNN) for any story; it's a decades-long journalistic practice not to use that word. This article still makes it very clear that it was Hamas which was responsible for the attack."
"Stomp your feet and disagree with it all you want, this is why they don't use the word ""terrorist""

"Ya but only because they have a crazy high birth rate and most women stay at home as their families can get by in a single income and have lots of kids.

Having large families doesn’t mean your elections are bunk or change actions of adults.  I guess it does if you use them as human shields as Hamas has often done and then Israel went and did in return to make some sick and twisted point.

But suggesting the high population of children absolved the adults is nonsense.

"All polling for the last decade has shown the majority of Palestinians support Hamas ranging from low 50s to high 70 percents especially in Gaza. 

Hamas was leading in their early election polling in 2022 and then refused to be in the ballot.  They are well aware how western perception of the separation of Palestines from other Palestinians despite being in the majority benefits them. 

If anything Hamas is supported by the majority of Palestinians, by a far greater margin than Netanyahu is in Israel actually. Or was before Palestine started the war up yet again last weekend at least.

Why do we make a distinction that Hamas is not Palestine and not all Palestinians are Hamas to the point of excusing atrocities as being totally divorced from Palestine but make no distinction or separation between Israel; israelis and their leader who has had far weaker support than Hamas does from Palestinians?

Why do we turn a blind eye while Palestinians around the globe in western nations gather en mass and chant to “gas the Jews” something their leadership literally took part in during the holocaust yet clutch our pearls if an angry Israeli even suggests Palestine’s actions might make them deserving of retribution.

There’s some interesting biases and double standards here for sure."

"Because Egypt isn't bombing them, and Egypt isn't who will refuse to let them return when the bombing is done.  The people of Gaza re not Egyptian, the are Palestinian.  It's not Egypt's responsibility to take them in, especially knowing they will be permanently stateless in Egypt if they come."
Israel isn't a terror organization because they are supported by the united states.  They still murder civilians at as rate that Hamas wishes they could achieve.
"The extreme right wing Israeli government is most definitely a terrorist organization.  Thier history of war crimes and apartheid racism is well documented not to mention their extremely high civilian body count.  
The fact that you support the killing of civilians because they happen to be Palestinian says alot about you."

"> I know people like to pretend it’s cause all the adults are dead to suit their antisemitic propaganda but… oops, not true.

The problem with your argument is that 'the population is mostly young people"" is exactly the demographic we expect to see following a genocide.

What is the age distribution of Indigenous peoples in North America now?"
"There were go.  Dude starts screaming anti-Semitism to shut down civil discourse. 
Yes you are right, Palestinians are living it up in luxury.  Gimme a break.

First, all civilian lives matter, yes even Palestinian lives no matter your racist views and hate.
Second, making irresponsible claims of antisemitism just to shut down debate undermines actual victims of anti-Semitism.  I mean you are just gross.

Not once did the article mention terrorist or terrorism. Why not? Hamas is a terrorist organization. This was a terrorist attack. That is factual. Instead they called it a Hamas Israel conflict. That is ambiguous and misleading. If you are uninformed you would think that this is part of some territorial dispute and nothing more.

No they likely meant literally universities if their post history is any indication. They’ve got an axe to grind and hyperbole is very much in fashion.
"That looks like a statement put out by what appear to be student elected union leaders of an undergraduate student union.

[York University](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/york-university-israel-hamas-student-unions-1.6996228) has condemned it."
"Not to nitpick but that wasn't York University, it was the student union. Universities, as institutions, are distinct from the student bodies and councils."
"This statement is wrong on so many levels. Firstly - “land-back” is exceedingly ironic, maybe tragically ironic. The modern state of Israel is literally an example of land-back. Literally the descendants of people pushed off their land nearly 2,000 years ago taking “their land” back by creating the modern state of Israel. 

“Decolonization” is another tragically ironic term in this context. Israel was literally part of the Roman province of Judea which was the direct result of Roman imperialism. Israel was literally colonized by the Romans. The Roman empire collapsed, the Romans left, many of the Israelites were forced out, and most of the Israelites who stayed were absorbed into the culture of their conquerors. The absorbed people eventually converted to islam and became part of the Palestinians. They lived as vassals to which ever great power ruled them. **Their last rulers were the British who literally decolonized the area into the state of Israel and the failed state of Palestine.** 

This whole tragic conflict is the direct result of both decolonization and Land-back! This only shows that these ignoramuses should just sit down and shut up. Israel/Palestine is doubtlessly the most complicated conflict in modern memory and trying to fit it into the half assed and half baked ideology of decolonization is asinine. Nobody is served by this foolishness."
Student unions are not university statements. They're statements by students. You could start by actually trying reading statements by the universities instead of rage meat put in front of you.
"Universities across North America are diseased with extremists that promote hate and destructive ideology to students and the public.

Public funding and how it is used at universities *really* needs to be looked at. Including use of funds at students unions.

The United States has started to push back on this problem in American universities but Canada has done nothing yet. It’s time for Canada to take a stand."
"What do you suppose they do? 

Speech and expression are protected by the Charter and these are all public institutions. They can't just go firing people for saying reprehensible things they don't like. The only thing they can do is attempt to administratively dismiss someone but that takes a long time."
"Where were you when israelis were celebrating Palestinians death ???? 
 https://www.timesofisrael.com/watch-far-right-israelis-celebrate-gaza-kids-deaths/

This was in 2014....  yes the  killing of palestinians didn't start this week... I have been going on for the last 75 years. 

This one was in 2015: https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/25/world/middleeast/ali-dawabsheh-arson-death-israel-wedding-video.html

There is also other videos circulating from this week... 

 This is a Genocide, ethnic cleansing and an apartheid. 
This is not a.conflict. Israel wants to erase gaza from the map and take whatever has left of palestinians."
They’re doing it as we speak.
Crazy you think you they COULD have done that. Sure man but thered be diplomatic repercussions. Much more so than leaving the slow choke of an nuisance population.
"That’s what they’re doing now. I don’t know if people are blind or apathetic to non-white people being killed. There’s literally footage on the ground as people are being bombed. No hamas soldiers in sight, literally just a bunch of kids"
Of course he can't
"The genocide israel is perpetuating since 1948. There’s a reason most Palestinians now live in diaspora. Now it’s accelerating as israel called on half the Gaza Strip to move south becuase they’re planning on flattening it. They also bombed hospitals and schools and there’s clear footage on the ground. No hamas militants in sight. Hell they bombed evacuation routes that THEY drew. The goal is clear and stated even by Israeli officials, killing the people of gaza. 

If being anti-genocide is pro-Hamas, so be it, call me pro-Hamas (even though I’m a staunch left wing secularist). A quick view of any of the footage coming out of gaza would change your mind. There’s plenty of footage in /r/Palestine you can watch if you care to inform yourself on the reality on the ground. You can ignore non-footage posts."
"Oh please this shit has been going on since 1948.  Israel.l was killing innocent palestinians since 1948. 

Hamas was created in 1987 by ISRAEL and the USA. 

Do the math!"
Not have created the problem in the first place.
The solution is not indiscriminate bombings of civilian populations nor ethnic cleansing and genocide
"Not use white phosphorous, for starters."
"I see what you mean and how it can appear like the two can go hand in hand. But I really don’t think the two are the same at all. Timing is not good, I agree. While people are mourning the death of so many people, to hold a march can seem insensitive and like it’s diminishing the violence. I think the way pro-Palestinian people feel is when you consider the way Palestinian land was carved out to make way for Israeli settlements similar to the way Canada stole indigenous people’s lands, people are standing up for the people (not Hamas) who were displaced, lost their homes, lost their childhood, etc. 

I also do not equate Hamas with Palestinians. Nor do I equate the Israeli state with Jewish people. Look over in Canada how most people don’t support Trudeau but he still has majority government. Can a govt ever truly represent us? Didn’t most of us vote for what we considered lesser of the evil? Hamas is a military terrorist organization and they hurt anyone that criticizes them. Would you have to guts to stand up against Hamas? I know I’d be too scared to speak out against them. So when people say Palestinians support Hamas with a majority, I would say think again bc that’s highly unlikely. 

I also don’t deny antisemitism exists. It’s very much alive. Literally the history of the Jewish diaspora is being persecuted with nowhere to go. I know micro aggressions towards Jews happen frequently in Canada too. But being pro Palestine is not the same as being antisemitic. Palestinians aren’t even allowed to use certain roads. Kids get arrested all the time for no reason. It’s about supporting for human rights"
"True, but if I was an innocent good hearted person I would have left Gaza long ago. You can’t live a place run by a literal terrorist government and not expect conflict all the time. 

Hamas will never provide for their people, the number one priority will always be acquiring weapons and plotting terrorism. Any citizen loyal to that place raises big suspicion in my mind."

"Hamas was made by Israel. 

only 1/3 of  Palestinians support Hamas."
"It is Netanyahu and the Likud's, if at least inadvertantly. They supported Hamas and allowed the direct funding of Hamas by Qatar without going through the PA. The idea was that if you kept the West Bank and Gaza under different governing factions which don't agree, then they aren't in a position to negotiate because there is no single party that represents all Palestine to negotiate with. And if there's nobody to negotiate with, then there's no possibility of a two-state solution. So, empowering Hamas against the moderate secular Fatah party and against the PA, in order to have a destabilized Palestine rather than a unified Palestine under a functioning government that could advocate for itself. This is the blowback of that policy."
"From what I’ve seen of what polls it’s possible to take, Hamas is still thought to have about 60% support in the Gaza Strip.

That said, Hamas has a long history of murdering people who speak out against them as “collaborators”, so nobody really knows what their true level of support is vs what people say and do out of fear for their lives. If they were disarmed and defanged and truly free and fair elections were held with a moderate party in opposition to them supporting, say, the settlement Ehud Barak offered in 2000 (which I think is the absolute best offer they will ever get) my gut tells me Hamas would lose, but it’s impossible to say.

Regardless, Hamas has no intention of disarming, holding free and fair elections, or not killing people who speak out against them, so unless someone like Israel steps in and eliminates them, nothing will change."
"Yes, but this is literally a thread started by an OP that said ""supporting Palestine"" = ""supporting Hamas"". By their logic, ""supporting Israel"" = ""supporting Bibi"" = ""supporting Hamas"" as well, since Bibi was democratically elected. Also, it's not just Bibi, Israel have propped up Hamas since the 80s as a counterweight to Fatah and other secular Palestinian groups.

Does this mean that the people of Israel deserve the attack? Of course not. But do the 2.2 million people in Gaza, half of which are children, deserve to be bombed to hell?"
"Amazing. You’re saying Hamas unilaterally represents Palestine no matter the fact that the election happened 17 years ago

"Some do that to make more money in the new country and send the earnings back home to their family. It’s common in migrants to the US. The trip to America can be dangerous for women and children and the job opportunities might be less for them.

What do those protests have to do with this? Yeah, antisemitism exists outside of hamas, and it's not pretty.  Plenty of pro-israel gatherings that condemned hamas."
"Yeah maybe, if they actually manage to do that and don't inspire a bunch of vengeful new recruits instead."
"No, I think when power, electricity and medical supplies are cut off to a tiny enclave of 2 million people, with 1 million ordered to quickly move to the southern half (an impossibility), it is most certainly a deliberate massacre. How else would you describe it?"
"The fact this is said completely serious even up to 4 hours ago is astounding.

>Israel is responding to that. 

Their response is an extreme overreaction that should be condemned by the international community and face sanctions. There is no calls from the west for Israel to use a proportionate response, let alone a controlled response to terrorist attacks.

>Israel has never had a policy to exterminate or massacre Palestinians.

Their response to the terrorist attacks is to annex the northern part of Gaza and partake in ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. Advance warnings of bombings is not a get out of jail free card. The Palestinians have nowhere to go. Israel does not meaningfully respect a 2 state solution whatsoever and do not stop settlers from occupying the West Bank.

>Hamas is wholly responsible

Egyptian and American intelligence told Israel about a planned attack before it happened. And most Israelis said in polling that Netanyahu is responsible for this failure and should resign.

>The complete silence from the organizers of these marchers to denounce Hamas is very telling.

Every Palestinian supporter is pressured to condemn Hamas, but even as Israel is setting the stage for genocide, there is no requirement for supporters of Israel to condemn rockets on civilian targets, or cutting off electricity/internet to 2 million people. Propaganda employs framing like this all the time. The discussion is still about Hamas rather than the extremely disproportionate response by Israel bombing many more civilians. Hamas's terrorism is condemned, but Israel's terrorism is not. Why is that?"
"Was hamas also responsible for whatever happened in Lebanon that required Israel to bomb journalists 24 hours ago, or is their aim a little faulty."
What is Israel’s objective killing innocent Palestinians why are you ignoring the fact that Israel is the one who started this but the media kept their mouths shut then?
The entire problem stems from the fact that Israel is occupying land which is not theirs and Palestine obviously wants that land back and Palestine is being punished brutally by Israel for wanting what is rightfully theirs
This channel appears to be pro-Assad and supports Iraqis slaughtering every American.
"They literally just backtracked on baby beheadings,  they denied using white phosphorus then later admitted to it. Denied tantra massacre then later admitted to it. Denied the  FLLF attacks in Lebanon then admitted to it. Boy sure is a pattern here, and the only source is ever IDF, every news outlet has the same source and it's always some Israeli military personnel or politician.  Only they thing really don't deny is funding Hamas as means of destroying Palestine.

Why you should support Israel? You do realize they've already killed more children in the last 5 days than Hamas has ever. Congratulations they just also just killed another journalist, Hamas was probably hiding in her microphone.

You've got carte blanche though because the US needs an ally in the region and Europeans guilt preventing them from taking action on the same thing they feel guilty aboutm"
So then why did you cave and delete your comment? Not going to stand by your words?
Let alone threes footage showing crossfire between IDF and Hamas. Very likely some of the dead are from Israeli ammunition
"So you are saying ""just trust Hamas""... yeah.... not exactly great sourcing for such a claim. 

Is it possible that some hostages were in Hamas facilities bombed by the Israelis, yes, of course it is. The responsibility for their deaths lies squarely on Hamas. Had Hamas not have taken them hostage after their disgusting terrorist attacks those people would not have been there and Israel would not have been bombing those places. 

I have immense sympathy for the families of the victims of Hamas, however we should be clear in what language we are using. It's not the ""IDF killed them"" its Hamas killed them because Hamas is responsible 100% for this entire situation."
"Yeah, Israel funded Hamas to get rid of the previous relatively moderate government, and blockaded Gazans inside the Gaza Strip, illegally denying them food, water, and the tax dollars they collected in their behalf, airstrikes them regularly, and then is surprised when the extremist group they funded attacks them."

The NY Post should probably not be the go-to source on this one.
"Yeah, her mother states she was told by sources that she believes to be reliable that she is still alive in a hospital somewhere in Gaza. She doesn't even know what hospital she is at, if the information is even correct to begin with. Though it was stated that she has a severe head injury and is presumably in critical condition if alive at all.

In the footage of her in the back of the tuck, you could see what looked to be a visible bullet wound in the back of her head. Her bra and top had been lifted, completely exposing her breasts, and she was face down, with her legs twisted in a way which looked unnatural and broken, up to her thighs. People were also spitting on her lifeless body as she was driven away. It was horrific."
"Oh gee, I'd think the news channels reporting that she's alive would have made some attempts to back it up"
Right..and that's why her mother run from news agency to news agency announcing her daughter is alive.
Apparently I know more than you but go ahead and feed us the Hamas script you guys are reading from
"I know very well that MANY people in Israel desperately want for children not to be killed in their name.  I feel for those people.

But I also know that there are people in Gaza who don't want this either.  That they had nothing to do with what happened last weekend.

And I also know that there are Israelis who absolutely do want to eradicate Palestinians.  I know that otherwise decent people smugly tell me about how Palestinians don't love their children, as though Golda Meir's famous line isn't racist dehumanization on its face.  

And I know that the IDF *often* shoots and kills small children for no reason.  [I know this because I listen to the Jews who tell me this tell me so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNqilIwiqAM).

So I think I am speaking honestly, and I am tired of the sophistry by which Israelis tell themselves and try to tell me their army only kills children morally."
"> There would still be tons of people on both sides that still want one religious ethnostate for their side only.

This is a bit of a misunderstanding.  I think Westerners conflate Hamas or Palestinian independence with Islam. But Hamas is not Daesh. They aren't religious hardliners except to the extent that religious fervor is used to recruit members.  What they seek is freedom from Israeli control, not necessarily a religious ethno-state.

Israel, on the other hand, is much more focused on being an religious ethnostate, and often votes for religious hardliners, even as the population is more secular.  'The *shul* I don't attend is an Orthodox *shul*.'"

"I have 0 support for Hamas and think that organization needs to be destroyed, but I agree. More Palestinians have been killed by Israelis over the years than vice versa. Then organizations like Hamas use that 100% true narrative to recruit people willing to commit violence against Israelis, thus continuing the cycle of violence.

Palestinian-Israeli violence won't end until Hamas is gone and Israel stops displacing Palestinian communities and creating Israeli settlements in their place. On top of that, Israel's neighbours needs to acknowledge Israel's right to exist. They were getting so close with Saudi Arabia before Hamas made their recent attack. Hence the speculation that Iran - which is opposed to both Israel and Saudi Arabia, and especially an alliance between them - helped encourage the attack."
It’s a common practice for just the CBC to not use the word terrorist. It’s actually their mandate when it comes to anything to do with Israel…unless they’re calling Israel the terrorists.

I feel badly for innocent civilians in Gaza as well but its not like Israel is taking action for no reason."
No one is suggesting that the high population of children absolves the adults you just implied that on your own. What I said was the majority of the civilians in Gaza are children that had no say in Hamas' rise to power. Implying that it's somehow the kids fault that their parents voted for terrorist is the real nonsense imo. Most of the children dying in these attacks on Gaza weren't even born when the vote in 2006 happened.
"> Ya but only because they have a crazy high birth rate and most women stay at home as their families can get by in a single income and have lots of kids.

This could easily be a description of many Israeli settler communities.

>But suggesting the high population of children absolved the adults is nonsense.

That's not the point - the point is that the children are being punished for crimes for which they are in no way responsible.  That's just as unacceptable as a music festival being targeted for the crimes of their government."
"I'll never understand the mindset of living in conditions like that and voluntarily bringing children into it. At what point are the parents culpable for the suffering of their children *knowing* the conditions of Gaza?

I get this can definitely set up tricky downstream effects, but on a very human micro level how can you possibly be okay with bringing life into a world like that? I know people who refuse to have kids because of climate change."
Hamas is also putting  up blockades to prevent people from escaping to safe zones They regularly also terrorize their own people. I trust those polls like i trust the polls coming out of North Korea
"> All polling for the last decade has shown the majority of Palestinians support Hamas ranging from low 50s to high 70 percents especially in Gaza. 

Polls in the USA failed to foresee Trump's victory.  In what way do you think they are at all reliable in a place where people are not necessarily able to speak freely, or where ""support for Hamas"" is understood as ""support for Palestinian statehood and a right to the land""?

Also, your assertions ignore the fact that Hamas was fairly elected in 2006...and that Israel's response was to blockade Gaza.  Canadians aren't fond of Trudeau these days, but if the USA suddenly blockaded our ports in response to his election, I suspect many Canadians would suddenly find themselves in support of our own democracy rather than being a puppet state.

>Why do we turn a blind eye while Palestinians around the globe in western nations gather en mass 

I don't know where you've been lately, but all I see are headlines criticizing demonstrations of Palestinian solidarity. I get that those feel horrific this week.  But I have listened to otherwise decent people tell me that the Palestinians don't love their children for decades, as though that's not a disgustingly dehumanizing claim.   And I have seen too many headlines about the IDF shooting unarmed children with no consequences not to understand why those demonstrations took place.  How is waving a Mogen David while the IDF bombs children any less disgusting?

>yet clutch our pearls if an angry Israeli even suggests Palestine’s actions might make them deserving of retribution.

The President literally claimed ""there are no innocents in Gaza"".  It's not ""pearl clutching"" to find that statement abhorrent and evil.  The atrocities of last weekend were not carried about by ""Palestine"" - they were the work of a relatively small number of people and were planned and supported by nefarious actors who made use of angry people, but who themselves are sitting far from Gaza, pleased with having provoked exactly this response. 

Anger that Israel will seek ""retribution"" against unarmed **children** just because they live in the same place as the terrorists isn't a double standard unless you think Jews are the only people deserving of land and safety in the Levant."
I think people forget that Israel won't let Palestinians return once they leave.  They're not staying in Gaza because they want to die - it's because if they don't remain they can never go home again.
Is it Israel's responsibility to take them in?
"Moreover, they arm and encourage settler groups to terrorize Palestinian neighborhoods in order to further colonize them. They have given the most violent terroristic cohorts of Israelis carte blanche to displace and kill Palestinian civilians for years now. 

Terrorism breeds more terrorism, which is exactly, explicitly what Netanyahu has sought. Disenfranchise diplomacy-focused groups like Fatah in favor of militant Hamas in order to build consensus that all Palestinians=pro-violence. Then, as they’ve explicitly said over the last few days “[there are no innocent civilians in Gaza](https://m.thewire.in/article/world/northern-gaza-israel-palestine-conflict/amp).” A disgusting, genocidal lie."
"Yeah, dude is just gonna completely gloss over the fact that the Israeli government is literally running an apartheid state"
"Blatantly genocidal rhetoric from the Israeli government, eh? Let me give you two examples of blatantly genocidal rhetoric:

1. “Seven million Palestinians outside, enough warming up, you have Jews with you in every place. You should attack every Jew possible in all the world and kill them. — [Fathi Hamad, 2019](https://archive.md/DjTo8)

2. “The Day of Judgment will not come about,” it proclaims, “until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.” —  [Hamas founding charter](https://archive.li/GmSpi)

Now where are *your* quotes?"
How is the Israeli government genocidal?
"Terrorism is a tactic, not an ideology. It's the use of force on non legitimate targets - ie ordinary citizens instead of government or military targets - designed to bring about political change.  

Hamas' actions last weekend were terrifying for being an attack on  ordinary people, including children, and were therefore terrorism,

The IDF's actions this week are terrifying for being retaliation against ordinary Gazans and their children, and are therefore ALSO terrorism."
It is.
"Oh that’s interesting. Political belief isn’t in the ONRC:

> Every person has a right to equal treatment with respect to [insert various protections], without discrimination because of race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, marital status, family status, disability or the receipt of public assistance."
"Everyone is entitled to their opinion but there's a lot of people who are talking about things they have no hand in and want to be the sole voice of reason.

I don't go around telling people what religion they're allowed to practice and who they are allowed to have relationships with. So why are those same people telling me how I need to live my life, and who I'm ""allowed"" to support?"
"Yep, anything that makes them feel that false sense of superiority"
">The left massively supports Hamas. 

Citation needed. Is Bibi Netanyahu on “the left” now?"
"This is such a bullshit statement.

It is not ""supporting Hamas"" to be appalled by the way Israel treats Gaza."
"Mmmm the left actually has a bad rap of supporting Hamas even directly this past decade and I say this as a lifelong lefty.

Up until a week ago I would argue with people that Hamas was an oppressive regime and they would claim I was racist and Palestinians had a right to choose since all the polls show for over a decade the majority are pro-Hamas and their terror attacks and genocidal imperatives.

Now it’s all switched and Hamas is definitely not Palestine despite all the support they still have to this day from the public."
"It's true that over the past few years the majority of ""the left"" has formed a very odd alliance with extremely right-wing conservative groups as long as they are perceived as being oppressed, and this is not a minority or only the ""far left"" doing it."
Supporting Neo-Nazis is an extreme fringe on the right. Supporting Hamas is mainstream.
Look at you acting like the left doesn’t do the same by calling everyone that doesn’t agree with them a bigot or Nazi lol
"Where do you think the logical conclusion of ""Land Back"" is?"
"I would guess in this instance they meant student unions, which have been posting some mildly batshit crazy insane statements on the conflict."
[deleted]
"Fire the staff involved. Administrative processes can be bypassed.

Worst case, CUPE files a grievance to get McMaster to rehire staff who promoted a terrorist attack. They probably won't, because then CUPE would have to spend months in the spotlight trying to get known terrorist sympathizers rehired. Wouldn't play well with public opinion or their membership."
"Hamas literally uses hospitals to launch rockets from, you fuck around and find out lmao"
The Palestinian population has been growing at some of the fastest rates in the world over the course of this supposed genocide.
"There is a large ground invasion and increased artillery, but these things by itself doesn’t mean genocide.  Their stated goals are to exterminate Hamas.  Which is not to say there won’t be a lot of Palestinian civilian deaths, because that will happen and it is unbelievably tragic.  But what would you have Israel do in response to Oct 7th?  Clearly the status-quo is not working. 

They drop leaflets, the give warnings, they drop roof knocks, they are doing more than any other armed force would be doing to avoid civilian deaths on the other side.

If the situation was flipped.  You and I both know that Israel would not exist, it wouldn’t even had seen the 21st century.  The Jews would have been systematically and intentionally executed en-masse.  

How do I know this?  It is literally in the Hamas charter!"
">No hamas militants in sight.

Hamas does not have a uniform they wear and there is unfortunately no way to actually identify if someone is Hamas or not, and this is done intentionally for this reason."
"Palestine population has skyrocketed since then.

Not an effective genocide.

>They also bombed hospitals and schools and there’s clear footage on the ground. No hamas militants in sight. 

Hamas uses these locations and has tunnels....

They bomb them because Hamas operates from them.

>Hell they bombed evacuation routes that THEY drew. The goal is clear and stated even by Israeli officials, killing the people of gaza.

No proof that was Israel and is looking like Hamas especially given Hamas is also blocking such routes.

I try not to watch Hamas propoganda."
The Palestinian population has grown 10x since Israel was founded. Not a very successful genocide.
"You didn't answer the question.

What do you propose Israel do?"
Israel does not conduct indiscriminate bombings.
But Hamas killed indiscriminately
Israel isn't doing that
IDF denies using white phosphorous incendiaries.
"A side point in this is that communications is limited, and a lot of what people in Gaza get to hear (and children educated with) is filtered through Hamas.  So it's not too surprising the level of support given.  Also difficult to pack and leave when, before you even have to deal with the border to Israel they have to deal with internal checkpoints which may not let them pass.  Saying the situation is a complete mess is a definite understatement."
[removed]
Yikes… this is make believe nonsense about palestinian views. Marking as misinformation. Please stop. History is clearly documented please go read some decent sources that explain the conflict to you.
The best way of killing Jews.
"The OP I responded to was saying ""All Muslims blame Jews for all their problems..."" and went on for several paragraphs about ""Islam hates"", ""all Muslims do/feel ____"" etc."
lol maybe go read another article about this conflict and see how Hamas is referred to. from literally any other global news source. go ahead. then come back and express your misplaced rage
"Here’s a few links for you to help with your media literacy:

Hamas referred to as terrorists 

Happy reading!"
Whose fault is it that there haven't been elections in Gaza?
Delusion is strong with the proHamas crowd.
"Lmfoa no it wasn’t.  It was supported in gaining support to shift away from the PLO but we cannot pretend they didn’t lie about their intentions. 

Hamas has been around since the late 70s."
"Israel is also to blame for Qatar funding of Hamas?

It must be that global Israeli conspiracy.

Do we really need to keep saying ""Israel"" here or can we drop the pretext?"
"They also maintain a pretty firm grip on available information and education in Gaza.  So higher support numbers aren't total unbelievable.  If, as you say, they were ""disarmed and defanged"" and there was a solid supply of external support that was managed and secured by outside nations that could be trusted to be there for humanitarian purposes, things would be much improved.  That's not going to happen voluntarily."
"And Hamas is supported by the majority of Palestinians, by a far greater margin than Netanyahu is in Israel actually. Or was before Palestine started the war up yet again last weekend at least.

Why do we make a distinction that Hamas is not Palestine and not all Palestinians are Hamas to the point of excusing atrocities as being totally divorced from Palestine but make no distinction or separation between Israel; israelis and their leader who has had far weaker support than Hamas does from Palestinians?

Why do we turn a blind eye while Palestinians around the globe in western nations gather en mass and chant to “gas the Jews” something their leadership literally took part in during the holocaust yet clutch our pearls if an angry Israeli even suggests Palestine’s actions might make them deserving of retribution.

There’s some interesting biases and double standards here for sure."
"Voicing stupid opinions is not equivalent to conducting a massive terror attack.

Gaza does not deserve to be bombed to hell. But so far it appears that Israel has been quite surgical in its bombing, considering the number of bombs dropped relative to loss of life, even by Hamas' count.

War brings much death and misery, it is very sad that this war is happening. 

Hopefully Israel does its best to minimize the number of lives lost while it eliminates Hamas."
"> You’re saying Hamas unilaterally represents Palestine no matter the fact that the election happened 17 years ago

Which is especially wild given the average age in Gaza is 18. Most Gazans alive today didn't vote in that election."
"What? I've never said that Hamas unilaterally represents Palestine.

That would be foolish.

I have said that most Palestinians support Hamas."
"It's not clear that he acted, other than airing his moronic opinion. But yes, Israel bears responsibility for his election."
Fortunately it looks like it didn't work and his popularity is in the gutter.
The whole Gandhi did it peacefully thing is one of the most moronic takes in the world.
[deleted]
"Dude, it’s war. And there’s no easy or possible way to target Hamas without hurting civilians. 

But still, even in the immediate aftermath of the attack, there was a video of Israel bombing a building in Gaza, where prior to bombing there was the “knock” - low yield explosive intended to warn of an imminent attack. This is, afaik, an IDF invention specifically designed to attempt to minimize loss of innocent lives. This isn’t the hallmark of an army deliberately aiming to kill civilians."
"Not a deliberate massacre? That would be Israel not warning everyone and intentionally targeting civilians (like Hamas did). I am not saying Israel’s response is moral, proportionate, or right (I am generally against it), but let’s be careful with our words, or we have nothing left."
"If it were a deliberate massacre don't you think they would have been slightly more successful? Keep in mind that we are talking about one of the most powerful militaries in the world, with a nuclear arsenal larger than France or Britain.

They are barely getting over two kills per bomb. That is incredible restraint."
"To be honest, I’m not up to speed on exactly what happened in Lebanon (I’m really trying to moderate my intake of news from there for my own mental health).

But, honestly, do you really believe that Israel just goes around shooting random Arabs when it feels like it? Generally, Hezbollah has a lot of control in south of Lebanon, and has historically been a conduit for Iran-supplied weapons to Hamas."
"No, that was Hezbollah. Reading past the headlines on reddit would tell you this."
"Seriously? Hamas basically redeclared war for yet another time. Israel has warned gaza citizens to leave the area. They are going to put Hamas down for good. Hamas likes to use women and kids for shields. 

If you go by the number of folks that voted hamas in. Approximately 40 percent support hamas. Thats almost a million people that wont flee based on Israel warning.

What else do you need. Pretty simple."
"Not really it comes from Palestine refusing and breaking all peace for nearly a century now and the Islamic conquest of the area attempting to erase the Jews before that. 
Like building a mosque over the Temple Mount, literally THE holiest Jewish site and never letting Jews near it again to this day?  If that’s not colonialism I don’t know what is. 

And murdering unarmed Jews when they try to see it long before Israel even existed?

Riots in Jerusalem against Jews based on myths and antisemitism, like claims Jews drink the blood of children for Passover, have a long pedigree going back to 1847, 1870, and more. A massacre much like the one Hamas committed was done in 1929 in Hebron, resulting in the expulsion and wiping out of the entire Jewish community there, which had been there for thousands of years consistently.

“The riots took the form, for the most part, of attacks by Arabs on Jews accompanied by destruction of Jewish property. During the week of riots, from 23 to 29 August, 133 Jews were killed by Arabs, and 339 Jews were injured, most of whom were unarmed”

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Palestine_riots

Palestines leader hal Amin al Huseyni wasn’t helping Hitler with his final solution and watching Jews suffer and die in concentration camps because of Israel.

And let’s not forget it was that same man who instead of accepting his own country which ironically would have been the first time a free Palestine would have EVER existed ( Palestinians were only granted autonomy over their land once Israel was formed.  The Ottoman, British, Jordanian and Egyptians never allowed a formal Palestine state.) decided to keep calling for the genocide he worked with Hitler on and attack Israel, over and over and over….

The problem is Palestine isn’t very good at it and Israel dares to have sanctions against them for the repeated and continual attacks and calls for genocide that continue to this day.

If the power dynamics were reversed Palestine would have killed every Jew a dozen times over by now.  

Israel winning has resulted in chances for peace, but Palestine will simply never accept it."
"they backtracked the beheading until they had more sources to confirm it, they do now."
What did I delete?
"Very likely given the indiscriminate nature of recent airstrikes however doesn't change the fact that she's dead because she was kidnapped by Hamas, even if died to Israeli fire."
"Nope. I didn’t say just trust Hamas. I said specifically that an Israeli confirmed this but given the extent of footage I watched I was not able to save all of it. However, it’s not far fetched that bombing Hamas is going to kill hostages. 

Also, no I’m fundamentally disagree with your word usage. Are you really saying that all war tactics and actions in war are justified because of the nature of the enemy? Why should they get a free pass. Not even the US was immune from criticism in their war in Iraq.

Not to mention, what’s their excuse for bombing the refugees at the border?"
slightly unhinged yea?
We did at least 7 9/11s after 9/11.
What did they do?
Wait till you hear what Japan did before.
"Americans will use anything but metric

But we're fond of this one"
Yep. Somehow Bush decided that 9/11 was a great excuse to invade Iraq.
We can simultaneously mourn and empathize with the Israelis who were murdered AND the Palestinians being punished for crimes they did not all commit.
"I lasted at least 5 seconds, pumpkinspicecum."
Why are they Israeli settlers when Jewish people have always lived there…
Is that *really* what every Palestinian wants?? Why are you so keen to tell them not to speak on behalf of others and then speak on behalf of others?
"It was a ""peace festival"" in the hippie new-agey meaning (you know, free love and all), it wasn't a political pro-peace festival. The area hosts music festivals quite regularly, a big indie music festival was scheduled for this weekend, I shudder to think about what would've happened were the two festivals reversed."
"Behind the shield of winning the geographical lottery by being born in North America, subjectively, anywhere I may suddenly be shelled by actual artillery batteries, instead of seashells, or shell pasta, I consider to be ""hell on earth"". 

Subjectively, not literally. Anywhere that is an active or semi-active warzone counts!"

"Shit's wild eh?

Had people say that our Charter doesn't apply to everyone, like what?"
"I initially thought she was 30 as well, and was surprised when I had seen 22 in articles which is why I remember it lol."
"She survived just FYI.

Edit: people are downvoting me but I read severalbarticles that did say she survived. [Like this for example](https://www.timesnownews.com/world/alive-and-critical-shani-louk-previously-believed-dead-survives-hamas-attack-says-mother-article-104343442)"
Every single article that I have seen when looking that up is stating that she is “believed” to be alive by her family after “receiving details” about her status. That is not solid evidence of her being alive.
"Because she's grasping at straws (again, understandably so) and somehow expects them to verify and locate her. That video was pretty grim, I very much doubt she was alive in it. If somehow she was, it's unlikely she still is."

"They literally fight over a reglious building all the time and hamas is a radical Islamic group

I think a lot of western realize Palestinians are not fighting for religious reasons, more they are fighting with for their freedom

But the problem is that radical Islamic groups are taking over most Persian and Arabic countries"
"If there was no Al-Aqsa and if Palestinians weren’t Muslims, 90-95%+ of global Muslims wouldn’t really care about this conflict"
That’s not what they asked for
that is very very generic. I responded to the comment saying people were celebrating this specific girls death so unless you find that source those are irrelevant friend!
"considering none of the “sources” were what I was asking for I do need more… but for your second statement, I absolutely despise terrorists! that’s why I condemn israel! as well as hamas! but let’s use your trick on you! The way you don’t question israel’s tactics suggests you are also terrorist supporter, but you tell me?"
"> unless they’re calling Israel the terrorists.

Please cite a CBC source in which they refer to Israel as terrorists."
"now do you think that might be because [the guy himself admitted it was terrorism](https://windsor.ctvnews.ca/i-admit-that-it-was-terrorism-crown-lays-out-case-against-man-accused-in-london-vehicle-attack-1.6556048)?

but I'm sure you did your due diligence and researched the case before linking it and didn't just search ""terrorist"" on CBC's website, right?"
"No need for conspiracy. They're right; you're not being gaslit. CBC hasn't used the word ""terror"" or ""terrorist"" for over 30 years now; the BBC for over 50 years. Part of the idea is to just present facts and let the reader decide what good/bad labels to use.

Of course, not every paper is like that. NYT uses ""terrorists"" from time to time."
You learn something new everyday 🤷‍♂️
"There are more dishonest brokers nowadays who want to pretend the CBC is being sneaky or nebulous, that’s why."
Which has been policy since the 90s. What is your point?
Please show me one article from CBC that used those terms.
"Did you find examples in which the CBC applied the label themselves, or are those references to quotes from other sources?  Like, if the Prime Minister calls a group terrorists, the headline might quote him, whereas the CBC might not use the term directly."
[removed]
"That was not the main point the OP went on about at all. It was the ""in the hamas-Israel conflict"". You may be focused on that but it's not what I responded to."
"I hope you’re not projecting your own lens onto mine. I think everyone understands what happened is horrific and very upsetting. It’s not about identity but that there’s a hypocrisy in the way the media and subsequently many ppl who have been covering the conflict where thousands to millions of Palestinians have been getting murdered similarly for over 70 years and there’s no compassion there. Barely media coverage there. And so there does appear to be a bias where Palestinian lives are not being valued. People who truly value and have compassion regardless of identity, would, I would argue have compassion for everyone"
They use the word terrorist once and it's to mention that the proud boys were just recently designated as a terrorist group in Canada. Your source isn't the slam dunk you think it is
"That article doesn't have them calling them terrorists. There's only one mention with that word and this is the sentence

""recently designated terrorist group the Proud Boys"" which links to an article talking about Canada designating them as terrorists.

Could CBC have linked to an article where Hamas has been designated terrorists? Yes."
Labelled by them specifically? No. It's officially discouraged by journalists. Maybe if you find a quote or stating that the terrorist label was given by someone else
I am implying that many western publications do not label any group as a terrorist group.
"And it’s not a new policy. Read CBC articles from Sept 11, 2001. You’ll see the words “hijackers” a lot. But you won’t see the word “terrorist” unless it’s a quote. For some reason, there wasn’t outrage about that at the time"
"You can find the word ""terrorist"" in CBC articles, but many journalistic organizations (the CBC, the BBC, Reuters, CNN, etc.) do not call groups ""terrorists"" because they view the word as a matter of opinion on the political goals of the group, and they aim to publish unbiased articles.

They will use the word ""terrorist"" when referring to a political designation, e.g. ""Hamas has been designated as a terrorist group by the Canadian government"" but they stick to words like ""militants"" when they are not quoting a source or stating an objective fact."
"This really shouldn't be too difficult to understand, but I'll try again: OP (i.e., the person I was responding to) implied in their comments that this article was shy about associating blame to Hamas for the killing of this person. I was merely providing evidence to the contrary."
So what do you want from OP?  An apology?
Hamas is literally blocking civilians from leaving. They want to get as many Palestinians killed as possible. https://twitter.com/manniefabian/status/1713240971691839489
"Wow. The defense of Hamas by CBC is actually fucked. They are parroting claims by Hamas regularly then use those claims to denounce IDF spokepeople on air. It's gross. It's amazing how biased the reporting is. It's like they completely ignore what prompted this whole thing and completely focus on the plights of Hamas.  

""I know your saying your not targeting civilians but ... "" like come on dude, your saying you're not biased, but it's blatantly clear by your own words there is.

The reporter labelled it as an attack while bullshiting about not taking sides and listing 100 reasons why he is indeed taking the side of Hamas. This guy is pathetic."
"Children are often just a by-product of having sex, they may not have good access too or education about birth control."
"By regional standards, the conditions in Gaza were actually quite good. There was a growing Gaza vacation resort industry."
Parents are 100% heartless bastards
They also detonated a car bomb along an evacuation route and are blaming it on Israel.
"It shouldn't be - because they should have a functional government to care for them safe in their own land.  They don't, because Israel doesn't allow that.  

So yes, Israel is responsible for their safety, and is failing to care for them."
How?
[Here’s a sample of public quotes from Israeli government officials in the past few decades.](https://www.palestineadvocacyproject.org/quotes/)
[deleted]
Are you even aware of how Israel came to exist? Prior to the 20th centuries Jewish people didnt live in Palestine. It’s a late 19th century colonial project.  Research the Nakba and the atrocities carried out by the settlers in 1948.
"in brief, it’s “one law for them, one for us”."
"creed might be interpreted as protected beliefs such as biological sex or political party? I'm not sure.

e. https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-preventing-discrimination-based-creed/4-creed

it looks like they haven't quite decided, they've left it open."
"If we want freedom, we have to afford people the freedom to be stupid and believe stupid things. If people try to tell you what to think or do, you have the freedom to tell them to fuck off."
"You nailed it, that need for moral superiority at the cost of their own physical destruction. It's scary if you think about it."
"York, CUPE, NDP etc etc etc"
"Israel hasn't occupied Gaza since 2005 and why would Israel treat Gaza any other way?

It's normal to have strict borders with a hostile region."
"I disagree with you and I’m not calling you a bigot or a nazi. Feel free to scroll through my comment history and point out anywhere I’ve done that.

So many straw men."
"Excellent use of whataboutism, kudos for saying nothing at all.

'The left' and 'the right' are practically useless terms with how many people they need to fit into a single definition. 

If idiots who do that bother you, don't perpetuate it. Simple as."
"And what do you propose they do? Expel students for exercising their right to free speech, and then get sued into the ground and have to pay out millions? So, what, take money from students that want nothing to do with this, and funnel it to students that are trying to comment on things they don't understand? I'd honestly rather not reward people for such opinions with a chance to soapbox the courts, and likely a giant payday at the end. It's great to say ""expel them"" and all, but you gotta think the actual idea through a bit. 

We're not Hamas, we live in a society of laws where we protect the right of people to speak, even when the things they say are genuinely disgusting. Like it or not, this is a feature of our system, and this is probably the thing that extremist nutjobs like them fear the most. To them the world is black and white; you're either with them, or you're a heathen to be destroyed. The idea that people of different viewpoints can coexist means that their entire world view is based on a false premise, and as such they try everything to prove that the world we live in is the same type of hell-hole they live in.

All those students should attach their names to these documents, so that they can live with the consequences of their actions. However, those consequences will be delivered by society at large, not some university that's trying to just not get sued as the needs of the students become ever more infantile."
"It's also a big part of extremiat Islam all over the world. When I was growing up in the middle east, a stamp on your passport from visiting Israel would be a very bad day at the airport."
"Ok so all Palestinians are hamas and all of them are targets. How is that not genocide? 

Suppose that some are wearing plainclothes. Are they holding weapons in the videos? Are there rockets nearby? Ammunition?  Where is all of it?

Suppose those are hamas fighters in plain clothes with NO weapons among civilians. How is killing them any different from killing adult aged Israelis who go through military service and can be drafted? Should they be massacred too?"
"Not to put too blunt a point to it, but how do people know adults (and really, in a lot of cases juveniles - see the well-known instances of child soldiers in Africa) are not Hamas?  They don't wear consistent uniforms.  They don't carry dog tags, not that they would be visible.  Another important point is that they don't have soldiers - they aren't registered with a central authority, they don't have a defined and structured command and control.  They are definitely not classified as soldiers, and it's also wrong to classify them as civilians because they are armed, hostile, and organized, if only loosely.  There's this ill-defined group of armed civilian combatant forces between the two normal categories which allows an uncomfortable level of propaganda that can refer to them as 'fighters' in popular victory and 'civilian casualties' in defeat."
"I imagine when the whole Gaza strip has been blockaded. The tunnels are probably being used by everyone for literally anything. 

Just my guess. But I'd like to see your sources of how they are ONLY used by Hamas. especially given the current circumstances.

Edit: if you support the complete isolation, bombardment, use of bunker busters(potentially even white phosphorus) on a strip of land with 2.5 million people in it as a reasonable retaliation to a terror strike. You are a terrible person. 

If you support the idea that many civilians will die in hospitals simply because they can't move before the ""warned razing"" or would die in transit, you are a terrible person.

If you beleive 1 million people should lose their homes, and even more land because of this, you are a terrible person.

If you can't see how both sides suck here. You are incredibly bias or ignorant.."
"Where has it grown? You do realize Jaffa (now tel Aviv), acre, Haifa, and effectively all of what we know as “non occupied” israel was almost entirely Palestinian at in 1900. Ask yourself, where did they go?"
"Best solution is one state, declare a single democratic secular state with equal rights and citizenship for all. Second best is to end it’s occupation of the West Bank, lift the siege of Gaza, and make peace with the Palestinians."
"oh fuck, youre right dude,

nvm guys lets pack it up, Isreal deserves a blank check to kill as many babies as they want. It's only fair. 

/s"
"Then you’re either delusional or severely misinformed. Entire neighbourhoods are being leveled including press, hospitals, mosques, and schools. Hell they’re even blowing up the route they told civilians to escape south from"
"Human Rights Watch indicates they have.

And if they had used it - why would they admit it? White phosphorous on civilians is a war crime."
Why are you only blaming Israel for the blockade?
And where is Egypt in this? Please stop your misinformation nonsense.
There it is. Must be awful to hate so much.
"Ohhhhhhhhh makes sense what you meant , I , for some reason, missed that. Sorry/thanks 😎"
Just be happy Trudeau referred to them as terrorists numerous times.
"It's Hamas' fault, obviously, and by proxy that makes it Israel's fault for supporting and funding Hamas."
"and Isreal has been engaging in ethnic cleansing since the 40s.

Your point?"
"When it was a deliberate policy decision of the Israeli government to allow funding to pass through the blockades directly to Hamas, yes. 

I think you're implying that I'm antisemitic for... criticizing a set of policies that Israeli journalists and politicians have also been criticizing for a decade now?

https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/

I can't help but feel you're on the younger side but there are a lot of factors to what has happened, similar to our funding the Mujahideen during the Cold War."
"Ohhh look, it's my first time seeing in the wild someone stating in an unironic way that because you criticize Israel you are an anti-Semite."
So I guess this is how someone justifies genocide.. it is sad how much Israel wants blood
[deleted]
"It is clear that he acted. And yes, Israel does bear responsibility for the actions of their chosen leader."
"I try not to make a habit of blaming citizens for not overthrowing the brutal, oppressive regimes they're being crushed by. Shits not easy, especially with unfriendly nations on all sides *also* crushing them.

And yeah of course a lot of them hate Israel more,  anyone who's lost someone to these retaliatory strikes will be an extremely ripe target for radicalization. That's why doing the same shit they've been doing isn't going to work.

How does Israel remove hamas without turning more Palestinians against them? Just go full genocide? What is asking for Canada's help going to accomplish?"
"I’m not in their heads so I don’t know if it’s on purpose, or they just carelessly attack areas but Israel (IDF) have a history prior to last week’s terror attack of targeting innocent people such as: 

Deeming a parcel of land on which Palestinians live as, of military or archeological importance, then a few weeks or months after the Palestinian residents have been evicted out, the land becomes home to an Israeli settlement. Palestinians put solar panels on their roofs to have electricity and they will come and remove their solar panels, they will also cut water lines going into houses, this is all stuff that has occurred before the events of the last week. While not violent, what if the local government took your property with no reimbursement because they decided your house was on a greenbelt, then gave your seized property to a developer to build on your old land. 

Last night’s attack of Reuters journalists isn’t the first time that IDF forces have shot at or bombed journalists of which there is very little condemnation and no apparent accountability. In 2018 IDF forces shot on protestors and were also aiming at medics treating said protestors, including a Canadian doctor who was shot in the leg while clearly marked as a medic, which is a war crime. There are other stories and video footage in previous years (2022?) of Israeli forces firing and throwing grenades at journalists. 

Since the attacks, there have been videos of Israeli civilians shooting Palestinians in the street, in front of Israeli forces who stand idly and do nothing to stop or apprehend the shooter. There has been Israeli propaganda videos where they claim to have killed Palestinians who attacked their forces, then when the video is analyzed it’s been deemed to be altered while also showing that said “combatants” were people waving their shirts in surrender, then were fired upon and had their bodies dragged to be positioned near guns to make it fit the story of them attacking Israeli forces first. 

Then there is all the weird people (not you) that give Israel full support for their actions by ignoring all the prior actions and saying things like “you support babies being beheaded” or calling people critical of the government as “antisemitics” which is akin to criticizing the attacks on 9/11, as Islamophobia. So if Israel are “shooting Arabs for no reason”, it’s very easy to handwave it away by saying “there must have been a reason” if people are constantly defending Israel for the war crimes they do commit without holding them accountable for the bad stuff they have done and continue to do. 

That said they do have justification for the terror attack that they suffered and bringing the group responsible to justice, just not at the expense of indiscriminately carpet bombing the region while targeting innocent people they offered to flee, much of which are not adults."
"Hopefully Israel dropped some of those helpful pamphlets to warn the journalists they would be dropping bombs on Hezbollah in 24 hours.

Then if your memory goes beyond 200 hours before the hamas terrorist attacks we will remember that Israeli forces were shooting at and throwing grenades at journalists in Palestine a few years ago. That is unless the news camera is pointed at them so they do a little Steph Curry pump fake with the grenade https://reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/ndprby/journalist_catches_israeli_solider_almost/

Or the time they shot at Canadian and other clearly marked medics in 2018, that damn meatshield cosplaying as a doctor."
"> Israel has warned gaza citizens to leave the area

And go where?"
Why would Palestine ever accept peace for land that was stolen from them the land the Jews reside on today is Palestines land which a small chunk was given for Jews to live and they took wrongful advantage of it and took over the rest of the land. Let me ask you if you invite me to your house and I come in with weapons and tell you your house is my house now and that you should just let me have your house in the name of peace would you accept it?
"I've looked up Lt. Col Jonathan Conricus as you suggested and cant find a single interview yet where he has explicitly stated that hostages were killed as a result of an Israeli airstrike. We both know that there is a chance that hostages will be killed though as Hamas has no compunction about using them, or the citizens of Gaza, as human shields. 

>Are you really saying that all war tactics and actions in war are justified because of the nature of the enemy?

Where did I state that? I said that the situation there is entirely the responsibility of Hamas and their choices to attack Israel, to divert money from civilians in Gaza to weapons, and to. prioritize their own violent aims over the welfare of the civilian population in Gaza. 

>Why should they get a free pass. 

Israel didn't start this, at least not this time, but they absolutely have a right to respond and to ensure that their population is safe which does mean destroying Hamas and their ability to wage war against the Israeli civilian population. 

>Not even the US was immune from criticism in their war in Iraq.

and Israel will be, does get, and has already got a lot of criticism over their tactics. 

I assume you have a better option for them to render their civilian population safe? to prevent Hamas from committing atrocities like this again in the future? Unless you have a better and realistic idea it's not really a fair criticism.

>Not to mention, what’s their excuse for bombing the refugees at the border?

I haven't seen evidence that can be directly attributed to Israel making a conscious decision to attack specifically refugees fleeing the conflict and where it is absolutely clear there was no Hamas targets present. Do you have such evidence?"

"I'm not sure why the response you got was about Ehtipian Jews.  [Thoguh there is a lot of racism and classism towards them.]

The reason Israel is called an Apartheid state is because of the way they treat Palestinians -pushing them off their lands, blockading them in small areas, preventing them from engaging in economic activity, controlling their movements, and denying them basic needs. 

Israel has de facto control of Palestinian daily life, but most Palestinians have no vote in Israel.  Yes, I am aware that there is an ""Arab"" minority in Israel who have full rights of citizenship, but that doesn't change the fact that most Palestinians are essentially second class citizens of a ""democracy"" that leaves them disenfranchised.  

This has strong parallels to the Apartheid gov't of South Africa - which Israel first condemned in the 60s, but eventually came to support, including by supplying arms and access to markets to evade sanctions though the 70s and 80s."

It's why we should always try and avoid war at all costs.

"I’m against the current Israeli government’s policy with respect to supporting settlements in the West Bank. The settlers themselves are Jewish religious fanatics, and it unfortunately only serves to complicate the situation. It’s also not directly relevant to the situation in Gaza where IDF dismantled those Jewish settlements in a unilateral withdrawal from Gaza in 2000s.

IDF takes precautions when bombing, such as the “knock”.  It’s also been true that Hamas militants and other terrorists were either shooting from behind or masquerading as medics. So, yes, in a fog of battle, innocent people get killed.

But I think most Israelis would find it revolting if there was some kind of secret government/IDF policy that specifically targeted journalists or medics. To claim that such policy exists without evidence is reprehensible.

That being said, it’s likely that there were instances of criminal acts by specific IDF soldiers - and IDF should be criticized if it didn’t prosecute them. Same goes for Israeli civilians (likely those settlers - and I already shared my opinion of them). 

I give Israel full support, but it doesn’t come with a license to commit brutalities or genocide. I support Israel’s right to defend itself and to do so while minimizing its own casualties. I wish there was a way to defeat Hamas without civilian casualties but I doubt it exists, and so I support Israel to find the right balance. When US, Canada and others say they support Israel, I assume they mean the same.

And lastly, there’s plenty of reason why people criticizing Israel are accused of being antisemitic. Of course it’s not everyone or even most, and criticism of Israel does not equate to antisemitism, but the reality is that they are often coincide, and those who stand awfully close and in silence are unfortunately yet unsurprisingly painted with the same brush."

To the South. Away from Hamas cells. Its pretty straightforward.
"Well all historical record, monuments, artifacts, carbon dating etc proves it is the Jewish homeland.  So your example is if anything an argument that justifies Israel’s side more so than Palestines.

What if you got your property back after it was stolen, then tried to share it, but then the guy who stole it tried to kill you and your family, so you beat him up, then he keeps making threats, shooting at your house, you want it to be done so you give them some more of your land (Gaza) then they just attack you again.

You’re saying you would sleep with your doors u locked or block the border?  You wouldn’t call the cops?  Pretty sure when people act like that we put them in prison. 

Yes there are consequences for waging war and calling for genocide over and over for nearly a century.  Why should Israel not only accept peace but reset the clock and pretend Palestine has not done all it has done?  Why are they responsible to give FREE water, electricity etc to Palestine who always attacks and calls for genocide?

Makes no sense.  

Frankly if the roles were reversed Palestine would have killed all the Jews a dozen times over by now.  Israel’s problem seems to be it has taken them so long to eventually match the brutality of their enemy when they could have saved a lot of trouble and likely lives and they just taken the land after Palestine attacked in the 6 day war."

If a university receiving public funds curtails a student's protected speech, that's not a university rules issue, it's a charter issue. That's not solved at the university board level. That's solved in the courts. 

At that point the university could try to argue whatever it wants about their rules, and how it's unfair that some students chose to criticise Israel instead of criticising the terrorists, but just like in a workplace, if someone tries to fire you for expressing protected views... Well, honestly it doesn't matter what you in particular think about it; you clearly are not very familiar with how much money you can get for wrongful termination, but it's a *lot*. Mind you, it probably wouldn't be a particularly difficult case either. We're not exploring new grounds here.

Also, certainly they've expelled students for offensive speech before, but the key element there is that usually not political. Courts are generally quite protective of political speech, given that this is literally what the promise of free speech is expressly about.

You can say nearly whatever you want; as long as political speech is protected, and the consequences of ignoring these protections are dire and very, very costly.

>	 It’s also been true that Hamas militants and other terrorists were either shooting from behind or masquerading as medics. So, yes, in a fog of battle, innocent people get killed.

Ok let’s examine the evidence, take this video from a few years ago. We have an IDF soldier priming a grenade to throw towards an area that contains medics and journalists. When he sees a camera is pointing right at him, he decided to not throw said grenade and walked away. 

Now was the “enemy” firing on them prior to the video starting? If he feels like he’s under threat enough to ready his grenade, I’m not sure what would cause him to change his mind if there was a legitimate threat. 

https://reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/ndprby/journalist_catches_israeli_solider_almost/

Also that video is one of many where there is seemingly nobody attacking Israeli forces before they end up turning weapons upon journalists and medics. 

>	I wish there was a way to defeat Hamas without civilian casualties but I doubt it exists. 

There is, it’s just a bit painful for them.  When US forces took out osama bin laden, they could have simply hit the compound with a drone strike, killing innocent people, but they decided to send a team in to execute him and any other militants who were there to attack the Americans infiltrating the compound. 

Now at this point I don’t have an answer of how to solve the issue because it puts the soldiers lives as risk going after hamas without bombing. But to say alternatives that prevent or minimize civilian casualties doesn’t exist isn’t correct. In my heart though,  as tragic as it is for military forces, I value civilian lives over theirs. Just like locally with police, I don’t want to see them get killed, but I’d much rather them take the more dangerous option for themselves than to take the easier option that protects them but will put innocent people at risk ie in a hostage situation."
"The full story that journalists magically got killed by Israel again when they were targeting someone else. 

Canada and the USA spent a good 20 years in the Middle East. How many reporters did we manage to kill in our skirmishes? Are we just going to go with IDF forces aren’t very good at aiming. Do reporters have magnets in their helmets that attract gunfire and bombs from Israel but the magnets repel bullets from North American troops?

The USA send a lot of money to Israel, maybe they can send some soldiers to teach the IDF what innocent people look like because maybe it’s a training issue."
"You claimed that it exists but couldn’t find the source and then claimed that it exists and can be found by looking up the name you provided… I did that and still can’t find it.

"They lived with Muslims for over a millennium. Israel’s “get-a-free-home” right to return policy attracted Jews from all over the world, though."
Tell that to the guy i responded first. Thinking that this terrorist attack is solely on Israel's shoulder is wrong
"Tattoos too, better not being her corpse back home to mom"
*If* she’s alive she’d be in hospital in Gaza which has no power or water. Things that are extremely helpful when treating someone critically wounded. Many many things have been “confirmed” only through “oh I spoke to this person” which is the journalist equivalent of “source: trust me bro”. Just par for the course during conflict.
"No, what you're doing is trying as hard as possible to lighten the crimes of the Palestinian leaders, and failing badly at it."
"IDF has not occupied Gaza since 2015.

Israel is not digging up water pipes to make rockets.

You know Gaza has a border with Egypt right?"
Well yeah. There are Canadians who want a Christo-fascist state here too.  Extremists are gonna extreme.  The way to actually prevent that it to ensure that ordinary people have power to shape their communities.  When a community is under siege - as Gaza has been - it's easier for extremists to take and cling to power.
"They were celebrating Hamas murdering innocent people, she was one of the innocent people that was murdered. Don’t know how it can be made any simpler for you to understand.

Just say what you mean and quit implying stuff.
"You do know isreal is to date the largest perpetrator of warcrimes to date right? A quick google will show you they have been impossibly cruel.  And what I say is a fact.

This is an unspeakable tragedy but it’s patently dishonest to act like isreal hasn’t stoked this flame. They did after all back Hamas in 2007 after a political assassination that catalyzed their seizure of power."
"Propaganda?? What propaganda??? These reports, like all others reports from Gaza, are released  by the **""Palestinian Ministry of Health""** located on Alwahda Street in Gaza, Palestine. It's run and staffed by the 2006 democratically elected government of Gaza. 

Medhat Abbas is the spokesperson for the organization and also Director of AL-Shifa hospital which houses Patients above the ground floor and Hamas on the ground and basement level, this can be verified by an Amnesty international report, and plenty of witness testimony... why  would  the **""Palestinian Ministry of Health""** say anything but the truth??

"Well they elected a government whose party charter is to war against Israel. They voted for the pro kill all Jews in Israel party. You dont think Israel has any reason to say lol nope. Blockade. It’d that or invade again against an army with no uniforms. Any country wound do the same. 

We are responsible for who we vote for. Like voting for trump, Americans are at fault for any messes from that. Palestinians in gaza are paying the price for electing Hamas."
Most Arabs in the region of Israel-Palestine do not possess Israeli citizenship and therefore have no representation nor the same legal rights under the state that has continued to occupy the entire region for decades. They live in segregated ethnic enclaves which exist for the purpose of ensuring Jewish majority dominance in Israel while their land is settled in a project of national extermination.
"The Palestinian population is one of the fastest growing in the world, so even by your chosen definition it has not been a genocide."
I don't think you are aware of the definition of genocide.

What have I said that is pro Hamas?  I'll wait.

Does you calling Gazan children ""meat shields"" suggest you're arguing in good faith and honesty?"
"We will agree that the UN and international community fucked up royally.

But how much land should Israel give back to Palestinians? I'm assuming that you mean more than Gaza and the West Bank?"
"Except the Palestinians and the surrounding states mostly want the Jews to die.

So do the Jews just give in and die? Or do they get moved somewhere else as refugees?"
A secular nation with Muslims potentially in power? What the hell are you smoking? Do you have any idea about what life is like in an Islamic country? Even a place like Dubai is severely regressive behind the glitz and runs on Sharia law.
"It is not possible to eliminate Hamas without collateral casualties. They operate from civilian areas.

And the white phosphorous claim is Hamas propaganda that you are spreading."
They have more than enough HE ordinance and don't need the negative PR.
"I do agree. I wish for that entire region that they could all find happiness, peace, and prosperity … but they are all about as far as you can get from that."
"This is the weird new propaganda line on reddit thats making the rounds, because it tries to remove the agency of Hamas from Palestinians' own political agency.

You said it yourself best when you tried to derail the blame game of 1300 dead civilians onto Israel, by spinning them as an Israeli puppet with no support whatsoever from palestinians themselves. Somehow you don't find the below statement you made utterly insane.

> It's Hamas' fault, obviously, and by proxy that makes it Israel's fault for supporting and funding Hamas.

Israel funding early Hamas needs context

back in the 70s, the PLO wasnt the pathetic 86 year old dictator Abbas that could barely hold his party together from collapse, it was a worldwide threat that killed jews in a dozen countries around the world. It was viewed back then the same way we saw ISIS today. It nearly overthrew the kingdom of jordan in an event we call [Black September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September), it was a major actor and nearly collapsed Lebanon into civil war. It performed a [terror attack/massacre at the Munich Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_massacre) and killed all of Israel's athletes. It committed attacks on American soil, including killing [Robert F. Kennedy's father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirhan_Sirhan).

Canada's own anti-terror units were developped to protect our jews against the PLO

Hamas started out as an offshoot of the muslim brotherhood, and was only a humanitarian islamic charity at first, not a terror organization. Israel saw it as a natural counterbalance to the secular PLO, and tried to help finance an alternative to it.  Hindsight is 20/20 yea, but back then it was deemed an obvious solution. You obviously try to finance and legitimize the least violent party in the conflict."
"All? No.

But why do you call it an apartheid state?"
What genocide?

"We’re talking in broader principles. As a principle, if there’s evidence that an IDF soldier had committed a crime they ought to be prosecuted. I’m neither a journalist nor a lawyer to be qualified to analyze specific instances.

“Tends” implies either explicit policy or turning a blind eye. Again - is there sufficient evidence?

Taking out Hamas isn’t the same as taking out Bin Laden. There’s also the issue of rescuing (hopefully) the hostages, and dismantling Hamas’s infrastructure. Unfortunately, Hamas is deeply embedded among Gazans.

And to your last point, military service is mandatory in Israel and so IDF soldiers on active duty are often teenagers themselves. They are sons and daughters who barely finished high school - and Israel takes great care to protect them. I understand the sentiment that you expressed, but I just wanted to share the reality of how the Israeli society views this."
"idk man, I think the fact that ""only"" 21 people of journalistic profession having died in 75 years of the Israel-Palestinian conflict shows a pretty standard non-genocidal attitude towards journalists in the conflict. And a few of thoses were killed by the palestinians themselves.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_journalists_killed_during_the_Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict

 Let me remind you that Israel has the most journalists per capita on the planet, because its very easy to set up shop there to report on a conflict without having to traverse the mountains of Afghanistan for a scoop, or getting hunted down by every single human being in Aleppo. 

Shireen Abu Akleh worked in Israel and Palestine for 30 years and got her credentials approved by the Israeli state each year as well. Even Al Jazeera, exceedingly hostile to the Israeli state, has a fully staffed regional office.


Have another line you want to throw yet or are we still at the Israel tries to slaughter as many journalists as it can?"
Well it was a European or British news outlet. Did you not find any information on the fact that they have admitted that hostages were killed ( and no mention that they were killed by Hamas)?
Well where were they suppose to go! Answer that
"Sure thing Qasim, you nailed it, 900,000 Jews left Arab and Muslim controlled countries, abandoning 100,000 square kilometers of land and hundreds of millions of dollars worth of property, and despite having shown little to no interest in Aliyah until that point, because they wanted a free home. Never mind the fact that less than two-thirds went to Israel.

Muslims committing hate crimes and government oppression had nothing to do with it."
"riiight. had nothing to do with those countries persecuting them and pushing them out.

must be nice to live in an alternate reality"
Nope.  Try again.
"I don't think that's what they did, but the Israeli state has controlled the resources in Gaza and treated the Palestinian people like garbage animals for almost a century so I understand. I just wish for no more blood, and the treatment of fellow humans as what they are, humans."
"Iran still struggles heavily with these groups and Iran is fully capable of being free from radical Islamic law but women are still scared over there

If palistians win they will just get taken over by hamas"
">They were celebrating Hamas murdering innocent people, she was one of the innocent people that was murdered. Don’t know how it can be made any simpler for you to understand.

You’re trying to make their original statement more vague to suit your needs. You’re slimy

>Also why the fuck would there be a video of a group of people celebrating a single individuals death?  

This is a far-fetched idea to you? That people would say something about recent news and share it online? Playing dumb, or still being slimy

>And then to think it’s irrelevant because they weren’t specifically celebrating her death is just… lol. Lmao even.

When they ask for specifically a source about this girl, and you provided something that simply isn’t about her, yeah it’s irrelevant 

>Save your ad hominem attacks and try to make a point that isn’t complete nonsense.

This isn’t debate class you dork"
That’s a fair point. Bye
"I phrased it in a way that was less clear than I intended. I intended to say exactly what I implied. 

Maybe quit reading comments in bad faith?"
"Lol thanks for the laugh, at least there is some humor in how ridiculous all of this propaganda is.

But at the same time, it seems to be working"
"Palestinians paid the price long before they elected Hamas.

And the West Bank didn't elect Hamas, but they're losing land to illegal settlements continuously, and 45 children were killed there just this year."
"Around 20% of the Israeli (as in citizenship) population consists of Arab muslims. They live throughout Israel with the same rights as anyone else, and they fight in the IDF.

Israel has never had a problem with all Arabs or Muslims. It only has a problem with Palestinians who want Israel destroyed.

What are you on about?"
"Hamas is the one who uses them as such.

Your defense of Hamas and trying to downplay their actions and reframe everything is clearly Pro Hamas.

Your arguments are clear. You not being explicit in your support isn't really necessary.

Do you make these same arguments against Ukraine in support of Russia?"
"How much of your land would you be willing to accept back after losing it unfairly ?

Why can any person who claims Jewish ancestry claim Palestinian homes despite having never been there in multiple generations?

Why are people indiscriminately being shot in the streets to cheers by idf? If any of this is okay to you. You're not a good person"
"lmao, Jews, Christians and Muslims had lived for hundres of years in peace in Jerusalem. It's only when the Crusaders and the Zionists came in power that the massacres happened. 

Heck, when the First Khalifah of Islam conquered Jerusalem from the Romans, he was horrified to learn that the Christians had massacred 20,000 Jews in the Jerusalem, and had ordered a Jewish Convert to Islam to bring new families into Jerusalem to establish their presence. 

Jerusalem had Christians,  Jews and muslims, before Europeans decided to annex it from it's inhabitants with no right, and to give it to European Jews. And they annexed it again and again over the years, displacing, killing, and mistreating the population, and were never happy."
"what Hamas propaganda? 

Are you seriously that delusional? why would Hamas rely on propaganda? they are alone in this world. More importantly, how would they even spread any information? the ENTIRE western media aparatus is on the side of Isreal."
"What bad PR? It's completely flown under the radar - most public, media and political attention is focused on Hamas' attacks on the music raid last week - and there's no sign of that abating. Netanyahu and the IDF have carte blanche to do whatever they want rn - and they know it."
"If you want to include the context of PLO committing violent and terrorist acts, you should at least mention that it wasn't a one sided affair. The very first thing the IDF ever did was integrate Zionist terrorist groups, and they have committed attacks that would be considered terrorist if done by the PLO, such as Operation Gift, Shelling Lebanon in 1970, the Yarmouk Complex bombing, etc.

It doesn't remove agency from Palestinians, but the fact that Palestinians have agency and chose to support Hamas doesn't remove culpability from Israel for also supporting Hamas.

> Hindsight is 20/20 yea, but back then it was deemed an obvious solution. You obviously try to finance and legitimize the least violent party in the conflict.

They could've supported any one of the dozens of organizations that did not have the murder of all Jews as their founding principal. There were many groups that were less violent than Hamas that also opposed Fatah. They knowingly supported a much worse, much more violent organization because it was politically expedient."
Because it is.
"Because he is one?   
The State of Israel and its various institutions 100% support and defend apartheid policies.

To name a few of these government policies we can start with Israel's theft of land on the basis of religion or ethnicity, [the famous ""settlements""](https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2017/50-years-illegal-settlements/index.html). Also the normalization of the killing of Palestinians and journalists to the point that the culprits are never punished  [(between 2008 and 2023 alone more than 6000 Palestinians have been killed while only 300 Israelis have been killed)](https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties). 

But above all, the institutionalization of a [""racial enclave policy""](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2022/02/israels-system-of-apartheid/) effectively transforming the various Palestinian territories into open-air prisons. 

[There is a complete list of reports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_and_apartheid#Opinions_on_applicability) from NGOs and different organizations that talk about it and how Israel has become over the time an Apartheid state if you want to read it. There are even [several studies conducted by South African NGOs](https://hsrc.ac.za/press-releases/dces/report-israel-practicing-apartheid-in-palestinian-territories/) experts like no other on the apartheid issue, that tell us about Israel and its apartheid policies.

But the facts and evidence are clear and easy to see, Israel crossed a threshold a long time ago and it\`s really an apartheid state.   
Now, there are people who want to call it a genocidal state, but that is another issue much more complex and difficult to establish."
I guess when you give up you just start repeating yourself.. lol..
"I don't know for sure why those countries don't want to take on large numbers of destitute refugees, but I would guess it's largely because of the destitution. Not known for their humanitarian efforts those countries are.

And again, objectively antisemitic demonstrations are not what I'm talking about. Im not arguing that they don't exist so I don't even know why you keep bringing them up.

The conditions in Gaza seem so horrendous that even if Hamas magically disappeared, a new group of radicals would likely form overnight, probably also blaming the idf since it'd be incredibly easy to do so. Because of that, condemning hamas without supporting palestinians seems pretty fucking useless."
">	Have another line you want to throw yet or are we still at the Israel tries to slaughter as many journalists as it can?

Sure, here’s a video of Israeli police threatening a reporter to tell the truth or else. The part at the end that didn’t get translated is the journalist saying that the person on camera, as well as others with him were holding their weapons.  https://reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/178e470/israeli_police_threatened_media_reported_and_says/

Threatening the press to “report the truth” seemed very en Vogue about 80 years ago. 

Also at least 11 journalist have been killed in the last week. https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2023/journalists-killed-israel-gaza/

"I e seen reports that Hamas claims some hostages were killed in an IDF airstrike. I can’t see any independent confirmation of the facts though. Terrorist groups like Hamas have a history of killing hostages and then blaming it on the nation they are fighting.

I am needless to say skeptical of the claims of groups like Hamas when they cannot otherwise be verified"

"One state solution won't work.  Two state could maybe be possible, but the Palestinians need to accept that Israel exists and is not going anywhere."
Unfortunately we’ve lost all ability to create new credible solutions. Calling for something that has been tried and failed for decades without coming up with any new ideas will lead to another 30 years of misery
As one as the one state is far far away from the other right?  Because one is not compatible with the other as long as Hamas is around.

What about a 3 state solution! One more for those don’t fit in either one!!
That boat has sailed bro.
"Defensive operations against terrorist states that just revealed through an act of mass murder of civilians that their will to mass murder of civilians is constrained only by their available means, which they are working tirelessly to augment

Hiding amidst the civilian population and exposing them to danger and death, which is a war crime, cannot be a magic bullet for impunity in the wake of acts of mass murder of civilians.
Those who join mass murderers in a call for a ceasefire the day after a mass murder of civilians seek to provide this impunity - and thus to enable further acts of mass murder of civilians

Hamas made its genocidal motives clear - that the scale of its mass murder of civilians is constrained only by the available means
 and that any state confronted by such a foe would wage war as is its right."
nobody there cares what Canada thinks
Now we just have to get the Palestinians on board for a two state solution. They still want a one state solution and genocide for the Jewish people.
2 state solution will never happen......delusional.
That could happen and hamas would still attack Jewish people
This is Canadian policy since 1947.
Too bad nobody cares about what Canada has to say
are we not seeing the end stage of a two state solution???
"Having two states I don’t think solves anything. 


Hamas is still going to fire rockets at Israel. Pales-Gaza is still going to be a humanitarian nightmare. 


All I see as being different is that there is a legal country border in addition to the de factor border including wall."

Right now, Iran and others use palestine as a breeding ground for terrorism. You'd need a strong country with a good economy and good leadership to resist that.

It's either Israel gets forced to promote cultural unity and acceptance and reform and integrates the people. Or some other nation like Egypt takes Gaza. Neither of those are the easy answers either."
"Does Canada boycott the illegal Israeli settlements, the thing that's stopping 2SS?

Canada and Trudeau need to realize that no one cares what they have to say. We are an embarrassing country right now.
"It wants me to setup an account to continue reading the article, which I’m not doing, but after reading the few paragraphs I was allowed to I will say I support that stance of a return to 1967 borders and a 2 state solution without any blockades. That doesn’t mean Israel needs to open their borders to Gaza and have an open border, but allowing trade and humanitarian aid to go into Gaza will suffice and it’s reasonable for Israel to still want to keep a strong border security presence. 

Overall this is what I consider to be the centrist and most reasonable take on the matter. It seems Trudeau is slightly shifting his rhetoric regarding Israel and Palestine which I’m happy to see. To me it felt like our government took too much of a pro Israel stance at the beginning."
"Israel has said they don't want to permenantly occupy Gaza, they're going to hunt down and destroy Hamas and then leave Gaza, this is what they've said, credibility is up to the reader I guess.

The challenge is Hamas controls Gaza, governs it in fact, so destroying Hamas will leave a power vacuum, and the Israelis have stated they have no intention of controlling Gaza at all, which means the region will be leaderless until someone else takes up the helm.... hopefully a pro-cooperation government for once."
Didn't Israel already offer Palestinians 95% of the territory they wanted?
One secular state.
So why would they be so quick to parrot the now-disproven theory that Israel destroyed that hospital?
Does he want a a two state solution with Hamas as leader? Are we calling for terrorists to form a state?
How about we firmly and steadfastly mind our own damn business
Problem is hamas does not want that.
"One party has blocked and made the two-state solution impossible.

"Trudeau please just stfu.

You have 0 credibility on geopolitics and foreign policy. Everyone, ideally, wants a two state solution (other than Israel and palestine) but the reality of it is far easier said than done.

No one respects you. Please just get to work and become a competent PM that actually does things to help the country instead of just divide us with unneeded and unwanted soundbites. I promise not a single party on the global stage involved in this matter feel your view carries an ounce of weight.

When things are better at home and Canada is leading by example instead of just virtue signalling and admonishing other world leaders, maybe we will have a bit more patience for you."
"..its either a two-state solution or palestine will just keep losing land to israeli settlements unti it has nothing left, no prizes for guessing what israel prefers."

"Ha, good luck. After this genocidal bloodbath, I'd be hardpressed to see Palestinians go into a 'forgive and forget' koombayah mode to find a peaceful solution. 

Mass murder on the scale they're experiencing right now is how you create terrorism forever. It's how you make a people hate another people with such vitriol (like, how Israelis hate Palestinians), that you will NEVER have a solution.

This is all just pissing in the wind. It's window dressing. Israel / Palestine is forever changed, and definitely not for the better. 

Mark my words, the only 'positive' from this is for the Israeli settlers who've just had their new Lebensraum cleared via bombs for their new developments in North Gaza."
Did anyone \[on the world stage\] ask for Canada's opinion on this?
Who cares. Lip service.
A one state solution with equal rights and without second class citizenship seems like the best solution.
Canada should shut the fuck up and better recognize that will never happen as long as Hammas exists. Most Israeli and Palestinians are just people that want to live life. Then you have Hammas which makes it impossible to exist peacefully. Wouldn’t need an open air prison situation if they weren’t around.
"Perfect, Jordan is already set up and ready to go"
Canada needs to be quiet and support the outcome agreed to by the Palestinians and Israelis.
"It will never happen because Israel is content with the current situation where it oppresses and kills Palestinians with very little international condemnation and receives a lot of money from the U.S. to continue doing so. Why would they want to let Palestine be a separate and potentially prosperous nation, threatening their control of the region? They will keep committing crimes against humanity as long as the other nations of the world call for a two-state solutions with words, but refuse to back it up with any action."
The states will balance themslves
"There is only 1 state in that space and thats Israel. And it won't give up anything to let a 2nd state form.

What this means... Palestinians are stuck as 2nd class disenfranchised citizens as in an apartheid."
Canada should stfu
too late
Or maybe dissolve israel and return the land back to the real owners. Yes thats the true solution
"A two-state situation in which one of them is a fascist settler project occupying stolen land will never work. 

The only solution is to dismantle the apartheid ethnostate and replace it with an actual democracy that has equal rights for all of its citizens."
No! One secular country where stolen lands return to Palestinians and they can move freely with equal rights to vote and participate in society

"Israel doesn't want that, they had 75 years to stop building settlements. They want to ethnically cleanse the entire region and they're not hiding it."
Israel would never agree to anything less than complete elimination of Palestinians and that's what they have been trying to do for decades.
He’s such a moron! Sure does have purdy face though…as my mom said! Glad she’s in the heavens witnessing this fukn crap! Maybe she’ll vote different next time! 😂😂

"I feel like saying that you support the two-state solution is your way of saying, I don't care.

The Oslo Accords and the two state solution has been dead for some time.  Part of the agreement was that Palestine holds an election and elects its first government.  They elected HAMAS who decided to tear up the agreement and yell Death to Israel Death to the Jew.  There was never anything improper about these elections.  They were held by a third party on behalf of Palestine.  But the result wasn't what people wanted so they just refused to accept HAMAS as the legitimate government of Palestine and pretended as if that never happened.

HAMAS and Israel have been at war for some time now.  But the relationship has kind of been like a mosquito and a person.... in which every now and then the mosquito bites the wrong place.

You support the two-state solution.  Sure.  But would you de-list the democratically elected government of Palestine from the terrorist list?  Probably not.  All this says is ""I don't care."""

"Two-state solution sounds fine. It won’t end the struggle around historically nuanced ideas of what justice looks like in the face of opposing claims of legitimacy to land.

It’s a cognitive dissonance challenge for many in western academia, which seeks to address “settler” wrongdoings, and assert retrograde legitimacy of people groups’ claim to lands, undone by imperial or territorial expansions, and the redressing of injustices that occur during the establishment of “sovereign” nations. No matter which way you go, it’s a very uncomfortable discussion full of implications.

Regardless, “It’s” always happened. And people were no less butthurt about it in history. It’s just the conquered and dispersed and assimilated peoples weren’t given voice or choice to the inexorable march of our past, even in the face of their own wars and resistances, and their stories and lived injustices are lost to history."

"Honestly two state solution is kinda been dead since the beginning of the century. the Camp Davis proposal in 2000 had the best chance, but that included equal land swap and long term land leasing for both side which either side could not agree on and that Israel would annex land across the east border. In the end it broke down, overall Palestinians where not onboard for the Israel to control the border and make the West Bank into a enclave and the Israel refused to move on this issue among other because national security has always been there top issues with any peace treaty with the Palestinians."
"What makes you think anyone gives a shit what Canada has to say?

Trudeau.. should really be quiet on matters he knows nothing about....which is pretty much all things pertaining to what's beneficial to Canadians.
China also supports a two state solution
"Well since it was founded in 1988 on land it did not own, it is a hard claim to make"
Ok I got an idea: What if we did 3 states?
Please read the Hamas charter. Two state will never work
"That was always the problem with the Two State Solution; when one of the would-be states unilaterally rejects peaceful coexistence and makes it their mandate to completely eradicate the other, it just doesn't leave much room for an actual solution."
"> but the Palestinians need to accept that Israel exists and is not going anywhere.

and Israel needs to accept West Bank's territory as West Bank's only and remove all those bullshit illegal settlements. 400,000 israelis live in illegal settlements in the West Bank."
Two state is dead after 30 years plus trying. That leaves one state as the only solution. It is a messy - messy - situation but a solution must be found that recognises the realities of two groups of people claiming the same land.
">Palestinians need to accept that Israel exists and is not going anywhere.

So what's the solution? That Palestinians should ""build their state"" in tiny enclaves with no ressources that can't possibly support their population?

This is exactly what Israel has always wanted. It is exactly what Gaza is and also that's what remains of the West Bank."
"West Bank has accepted a two state solution basically forever.  They have had chances to do it and it fell apart over things like right to return. 

Hamas even accepts palastine with 1967 borders.  This has been true for a long time.  While they won’t recognize the Israel itself they would accept palastine with 1967 borders.  Israel would have its borders and no interaction with Hamas.

That's rich when you realize Israel is the only state threatening the existence of the opposing side.
"The PA recognized Israel decades ago, this is an old talking point"
"I mean, the PLO agreed to talks if Israel would stop settlements during negotiations, which is beyond reasonable.

Hamas would probably need to be removed for Gaza to be involved in talks, which Israel hasn't wanted in the past since Palestine is weaker with two ruling parties."
"I dont even think a Two state system would work. I think a one state with cultural acceptance is more plausible.

Palestinians are a young (massive amounts U18) and relatively uneducated demographic. You can't form a country from that. It'd be at best, a poor welfare state relying on foreign aid, and at worst, a breeding ground for terrorist cells and full of oppression, basically how it is now."
"Fair point. Although I think most Palestinians can get behind this and I do truly believe it’s just the extremes from both sides that aren’t in support of that. 

Hamas has actually had leaders in the past who supported peace but Israel made an assassination attempt on the first in Jordan and the other was taken out by his own men.. 

I believe the chant “river to the sea Palestine shall be free” is more of a sensationalist and emotional chant more so than an actual expectation."
"Well, Israel also has to accept that Palestine exists and return land that was stolen from Palestinians."
I think it’s the other way around. Israel needs to accept the Palestinians exist. Two state solution is the best. No reason why people live in an open air prison like Gaza.
What in Israel's action suggest that they accept that Palestine exist?  Shutting off water? Demanding half the population relocate in an impossible fashion? Bombing the absolute hell out of Gaza while also killing people in the West Bank?

"Why does Israel get to exist, even though it's a direct result of expropriation of land?

"It has worked in US, Canada, Australia where colonial forces took over land but learned over time to respect the rights of the indigenous people."
And Israel needs to acknowledge that Palestine exists as well. (They currently do not)
Good luck with that.
Move Isreal to Florida.  Problem solved.
A Palestinian state would make Yemen look like Switzerland. It would be an impoverished authoritarian nightmare which would spend all its money on weapons.
"This will never happen.

This will go on forever or until one side gets wiped out."
Step 0) Palestine people need human rights.
"Then when the Palestinians have their own country, and they start a war against Israel, then Israel can trounce them again and go fully 1st Century on them."
"This right here.. There are 48 Muslim majority nations on the planet, there is only one Jewish state. It's really not asking a lot that Israel simply be allowed to exist as a Jewish homeland, unless of course, you don't really like Jews....."
But hamas are not interested in peace and wants to kill all the jews to create a completely Muslim state
One secular state would absolutely work. Two states will never work because it does not address the right of return.
"To be fair the Gaza government wants all of Israel dead, so they want a one state solution or as the German’s called it the final solution"
dont forget the hordes of useful idiots in the west propping them up too.
"two state solution is still river to sea
 west bank borders Jordan river， gaza borders sea"
"Because in Canada's opinion, there is currently one state, but there should be two states. Seems pretty straightforward to me."
It’s hard to recognize Palestine when they refuse to give state official borders that don’t include all of Israel. You need official borders to be a state. Maybe the plo should say screw it to gaza and only recognize the West Bank as Palestine because there’s no compromise with Hamas in gaza.

"You might also want to address the fact that Netanyahu has been doing his part to sabotage a two-state solution for practically his entire political life.

I mean what does [this](https://www.palestineportal.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Maps_1897-Present.jpg) look like to you? We've been witnessing the gradual ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from their land for the past eight decades into increasingly smaller and more precarious bantustans. We're seeing Israel follow the same playbook used in the Americas on the indigenous population
"I think two state could have worked if America and the west didn't overwhelmingly support one of the states.

Israel never had to negotiate, they could dictate terms, and could ignore international law. Why should they give Palestinians anything remotely fair when they are so much weaker than them?"
Where is this comment coming from? All the nations in the world basically agree that a two state solution is the only fix. Do you know something that they don’t? Or are you just parroting the right wing Israeli governments talking points?
They don’t even officially recognize Palestine.
"The WB settlements aren't stopping the peace process. Palestinians have been offered multiple times full control of Gaza, WB, land swaps to link Gaza and WB, and the Arab section of Jerusalem and it was turned down.

To be clear I don't support the WB settlements but there are far more issues than that. Right of return, what a 2 state solution is considered, and so many other details."

They didn't.
Standard war propaganda
"No, Hamas isn't the leader of Palestine, which has its own president (who is not Hamas). Hamas is a militant group that 'rules' the Gaza strip within Palestine, but what Trudeau is talking about is a two state solution between Israel and Palestine."
"Innocent people dying, etc."
"This is the solution and all it take is an Israeli patriot who recognizes how much they are losing in military spending and has the courage to bring down the walls of apartheid and welcome all Palestinians into a new democracy based on equal rights for all residents including right of return.

Imagine the potentials opening trades will all neighbors, tourism, technology hub, etc etc"

The only thing that the Israelis agree to is that Palestinians need to be removed from the West Bank
"Just so you know, Israel was always supposed to be a two party state. In 1948 the plans were designed to have Israel, Palestine, and then Jerusalem as an International Zone.

"Ohh please, stop using the apartheid language is not factual and you look childish"
Everybody else sucks about as hard though
They had the option in 1948. But instead they decided to start a war and lost.
"138 of 193 UN member states recognize Palestine. That’s 70% of the entire world. So yes. One of the few, as a vast majority do recognize it. Hate to have to give you a geography lesson on Reddit but NATO doesn’t cover most of the world."
Says more about what kind of alliance NATO is…
"The list is pretty much limited to just NATO, the rest of the world outside of that (which is most of the world) recognizes the Palestinian right to self-determination."
Why do these countries not recognize Palestine?
So basically the civilized world.
"> Why don't another country suggest that Canada should adopt a two state solution for themselves and see what the backlash to that is.

"That's the problem with terrorists.  Can't work with them, can't work with them."
The problem with that argument is that the PLO/Fatah actually accepts recognition of Israel and wants to negotiate.
"In which case, the Palestinians might want to get to work quickly on proposing a peace plan around precisely those lines."
"
Palestinians are a young (massive amounts U18) and relatively uneducated demographic. You can't form a country from that. It'd be at best, a poor welfare state relying on foreign aid, and at worst, a breeding ground for terrorist cells and full of oppression, basically how it is now.

The 1967 ship has sailed. Hamas needs to start negotiating in the real world.  50 years of terrorism isn't really working for them.
And by no interaction you mean hamas would continue to kill jewd
"""Hamas even accepts palastine with 1967"" that's wet bullshit and is even contradicted in the article you linked.  


\-- "" “Hamas advocates the liberation of all of Palestine but is ready to support the state on 1967 borders without recognising Israel or ceding any rights,""  
WTF does that mean ?  


""Hamas, which wrested control of the Gaza Strip in 2007 "" - lol they threw PA officials out of windows - wrested..."
"Wrong, all solitions require peace for Israel. The Palestinians cannot be a country building arms on the border of Israel. That is the crux of the problem. Palestinians need to dig deep here and choose, war or peace."
"Have they though?

Continued terrorist attacks don't really give the ""we accept that you're here and our neighbors"", and more ""kill all the Jews"".

Take the concrete portion of the wall in central Israel. Since it was installed in the 2010s (IIRC, I can't remember for sure), the number of terrorist attacks in those specific areas fell A LOT.

And I don't even *need* to mention Gaza. Hamas' charter literally says that they want to bring in an Islamic caliphate and to *literally* kill all the Jews.

None of these things conveys ""acceptance"".

Now, I also think that a two state solution is the best option, but it won't work unless all Palestinians and their ""leadership"" realizes that they need to get their shit together or it'll only get worse for them.

I remember seeing an article a few days ago from the EU where the EU Council made a public warning for the PA in the West Bank to ""distance themselves from terrorism"", or any future funding could be curtailed."
"No they didn't, they've rejected every 2-state deal offered, and Hamas, who runs Gaza, very explicitly refuses to agree to any solution that involves Israel still existing."
This is misinformation. Palestine has firmly rejected any two state solution.
"lol. The Palestinian leadership has rejected every two-state solution proposed to them by Israel, time and time again. They most certainly did not 'agree to that decades ago'."
[deleted]
Israel offered peace and a two state solution twice.  Palestine rejected it both times and refuses to accept the existence of Israel.
More like the other way around.
"Wait, is Hamas not in control of Gaza?  Or are they willing to hug it out with Jews and no longer wipe them off the planet?  Did I miss something?  Can you elaborate?  If you mean the Palestinian people, then I would counter that many Israelis also support Palestines right to exist."
Hamas wasn’t a thing back when the PLO made the deal. Israel went on to fund Hamas and prop them up.
Hamas governs the Gaza Strip. Have they agreed to the Oslo accords and a two-state solution?
[deleted]
Israel exists and it always will. That’s not Zionism.
Jewish people were in Israel long before Arabs colonized it.
"I think the more immediate things they want right now are water, medicine, to stop having bombs dropped on their children's beds while they sleep, to not have to dig mass graves to bury their dead in, to not have 60+ family bloodlines completely wiped from the registry, to not be forced out of their homes where they've lived for decades. Just trivial stuff like that. Good on you for thinking long term though."
That’s not the meaning of the phrase…
"Three states technically, Hamas isn't ruling the West Bank, and the west bank is recognised by most of the world."

"What two state solution? There have been plenty of negotiations for such a thing but Palestine has never agreed to one that I'm aware of. After the latest peace talks in 2014 the Palestinian people have the mandate (60% approval) to only accept new borders of Palestine of ""from the river to the sea"". This is of course the entirety of the area and means the destruction of the state of Israel. 

So I ask again, what two state agreement? The Palestinian proposal only allows for one state from the river to the sea."
And yet Palestine has rejected every negotiated settlement ever offered to them that would have prevented this. They've never agreed to a two state solution and thus have no laws protecting them. From the PLO to Hamas the only thing the Palestinian people have ever voted for is the destruction of the state of Israel but yet somehow Israel is supposed to abide by an agreement that the Palestine rejects. Tell me how that works?

On the Palestinian side, it was historically a place for multiple religious groups and most current day Palestinians [denounce Hamas](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/polls-show-majority-gazans-were-against-breaking-ceasefire-hamas-and-hezbollah).

People however start to lose a little bit of sympathy when the retaliation ratio is 1:1000.

From what I see, Israel's death toll has not really risen since day 1/2. Children are being bombed to death literally every hour in Gaza. One probably died between me starting this reply and now."

"So how else to describe the treatment of Palestinians in Israel?
There will be no Palestine state because thats what Israel is successful working towards and achieving it."

"San Marino has a population of ~30K. Canada has a population of ~40,000K. Many of the 138 are small nations. Notable exceptions being Indian and China.

">138 of 193 UN member states recognize Palestine. 

How many of them matter though?"
"It’s a bit misleading without the context that the vast majority of what would be considered Canada’s peer states do not. We do not often compare things like policies, economies, and so forth to Sao Tome and Principe or Burkina Faso, we compare to the G7, the G20, NATO members, etc."
"The majority of the UN countries are dictatorships with no human rights. So what they think is honestly irrelevant.

Only the opinion of democracies should count.

But hey, North Korea also firmly supports Palestine. So there’s that."
"It represents the most powerful countries in the world, by a long shot.

They’re not going anywhere in terms of their sway either. Chinese and Russian demographics will make any challenges to western influence relatively inconsequential in the coming decades."
"These countries also recognize the right to self determination, they just don't think you can recognize a state that doesn't have agreed borders with its neighbours, and that Palestine and Israel need to reach agreement on that and other matters before a state can exist."
"You can find each country's rationale in the table titled ""no diplomatic recognition, here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_the_State_of_Palestine

For many, the position is similar to Canada's, that recognition is premature until there is a negotiated agreement between Israel and Palestinian representatives."
"While all of us like to act like we're internationally significant, the truth is that we're all under the umbrella of the USA, we don't really make decisions for ourselves if the US is involved. They say jump, we ask how high."
Because most of these countries have thrived from settler colonialism and Israel is a settler-colonial state too.
And I remember there were things that happened in the 1970s in Quebec that I personally would consider a bit of a backlash.
"I remember that referendum and I remember it being very very close to going the other way, so I'm not sure painting it as you did is quite historically accurate."

"Well it currently is both a poor welfare state relying on foreign aid,  subsequently funding the terrorist cells. Doesn't help that the west keep victimized them and has removed all agency from Palestinians. If only the 2 billion yearly was used on education amd infrastructure...."
"I mean, that's what started the whole problem in the first place. Jewish/Zionist settlers have been displacing and the local population for 100 years, since before Israel was even a country. This is a fact. Look at % change in demographics and the expanding borders of Israel over time in that region. Not to mention that Israel is a theocratic nation guided by a religion in direct opposition to Islam which causes more tension. Just going about setting up a new country and giving it to non-locals while breaking promises you made to local inhabitants over land ownership in the region was probably a dumb idea (looking at you Britain)"
Wait aren’t they the most educated demographic per capita in the world ? I could have sworn I read that somewhere
But hamas does not want peace and wants to completely eradicate the jews.
"Well two state dead in many people’s mind and one state dead in many other people’s mind, where does that leave us?  

I’ll tell you - one state cantonisation is the only solution in my view. Two state proponents have an onus on them after all this time as to how that is still viable, when the West Bank is chopped up like spaghetti. 

Not a Hamas supporter, those terrorists have created a dangerous situation by their horrific actions but also understand the utter frustration that the Palestinian people feel."
"How would a Palestinian nation function? It's a widely uneducated and U18 demographic. You can't make a nation of mostly children and the uneducated. It'd be a continuation of this humanitarian disaster.

At best, they'd need foreign aid forever and basically a country to manage the region for them, and at worst, it'd continue being a terrorist breeding ground and full of opression."

Neither was non violence. Until 13 days ago the world had basically turned its back on Palestine and decided to let Israel do whatever it wanted.
Hamas is not in the West Bank
An impossible compromise is the only path forward for Palestinian statehood where anything but pre-1947 borders will result in a continued cycle of violence.
It means that it's not about the borders. It's about the right of Israel and jews to exist. It's in their original charter. This is why I'm sure I will be dead in 50~60 years before they have their conflict solved.
Just another lying Zionist.  The Palestinians have rejected Israel's ever shrinking offers and have only demanded that their state be the entire West Bank.
"""As of January 2023, there are 144 Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including 12 in East Jerusalem. There are over 100 Israeli illegal outposts in the West Bank.

"OK, so do you call for all religious states to be abolished or only Israel? And if only Israel, why the only Jewish state when there are hundreds of other religious states?"
"Looks like it was ""Jewish groups"" who jumped the gun on that one."
">Because it was misreported in the news. NATPO and The Toronto Star said Trudeau blamed the IDF on the hospital bombing, the Toronto Sun actually said Trudeau never said that and were right. Even a broken clock is right twice a day."
zionists are going around screaming that Palestinian protesters need to be arrested here. Of course they’re gonna whine about that
You realise that being Jewish doesn't give you some inherent ability to always be correct? Emotions are high and people are going to make stupid accusations against one another with no merit.
"There is a big difference on how both sides are conducting warfare, Israel is going as far as giving notice of what places they are bombing; Hamas? Specifically targeted civilians, raped women and killed children.

I don’t care what kind of moral gymnastics you want to make, what Hamas has done is inexcusable and monstrous."
I mean technically we are part of it. Canadians deployed as a UN peacekeeping mission to Golan Heights
"Israel has agreed to *their* version of a two-state solution, but it has never agreed to a complete withdrawal from the West Bank."

It's almost like the Western allies were the ones that got around a table and drafted the idea for Israel in the first place.

"The only countries that matter are the US, UK, India, China and Russia. NATO only covers two of those five. And NATO doesn’t even cover the two that have a quarter of the worlds population in them. Sorry, the facts don’t agree with your feelings."
"Lol what defending.

The west comes in, destabilizes a country and then leaves it worse off.

There's good reason American foreign policy is hated in many parts of the world."
"Right but then India and China alone would mean more people recognize Palestine than in all of nato combined lmao Just those two never mind all the others, which add up quickly even if they are small."
What the fuck was 1967 agreement then
As was firmly demonstrated in the second Iraq war?
"I think Canada handled that really admirably. People were given a choice and respectfully discussed all options until a decision, by the people, was made."
"The biggest thing was probably the banks and insurers leaving Montreal for Toronto, but that wasn't a backlash, they just didn't want the uncertainty of not knowing whether they'd still be in Canada or not in the next few years."
I don’t remember the 70s. Quebec had a free and fair election and chose to stay united. Not too mention the French president said long live free Quebec in front of all of Montreal.
We almost had a two state solution. I don't recall Quebec firing missiles into Ontario and kidnapping over a thousand people.
afaik the needle has shifted continuously to ‘stay in Canada’ as time has gone by.
Vivre le Québec Libre. Of course he also said Algeria would never be independent so his record on these things was not good.
"The vote was close. And yet, we have full peace with Quebec. I think you're misremembering things."

Do Muslims or Jews dislike Christians?

Hell yeah. Bring all the bible battle tank mobility scooter operators you can muster
"I’m a crazy, obese Canadian Evangelical.  May I come?  ;)"
"He means Cis-Jordan, but West Bank means the same thing. It's referring to which side of the Jordan River the state is"
Nah just flatten the whole place I guess. Nobody deserves it.
Radicalization is what happens when an apartheid state represses and kills people. Take away Hamas reason to exist and it will weaken to irrelevance over time.
"Probably the lines of the west bank.  If Palestinian leaders were just calling for israelis to remove all its citizens from the west bank, Israel could listen and respond with a counter offer.  Or even just agree if they had trust it wouldn't result in another intifadah.  In the past Israel has agreed to these types of terms, but Palestine has rejected them.

Instead we hear from Palestinian leadership ""From the river to the sea"", to which Israel's only response can be ""No, Israel will retain some land between between the Jordan and the Mediterranean."""
Mr. Arafat died a very rich man.
"Jews were from the middle east.  They are likely genetically almost identical except for small percentage of German or Russian.  It reminds me of that Star Trek where one group is white and black and the other is black and white.  It is literally where they originate.

Maybe we can try three states?
"What is Palestine here that you refer to? Because the leadership in Gaza is Hamas, whose charter is the destruction of Israel and killing all Jews."
Should you just kill people because you took their land and they want it back?
"neither would any other border system, they are failed group of people at this point."
"Because Egypt blocked the straits of Tiran which impacted Israeli shipping, as well as mobilized its military to the border. Israel may have attacked first but Egypt gave it every reason to do so. Did you stop reading that book after the first page?"
"If you think Gaza - and especially the West Bank - are at all comparable to concentration camps, you need to brush up on your history lessons."
"Israel already offered two peace deals.  You could take a look at those, although conditions may have changed since then. 

The population of Gaza is growing rapidly. They ain't starving or suffocating."
"You are not in a concentration camp because the people you promise to commit genocide on does not treat you nicely.

If your neighbour not only threatened to kill you constantly but tried multiple times, would you not lock your doors and build a fence? Or would you invite them in your house to let them kill you?"
">Neither was non violence.

Hamas hasn't tried that yet.  When they aren't terrorizing Israelis they're terrorizing their own people."
"Justifying the Hamas violence. 

You are too far gone. 

Killing innocent civilians is wrong. 

For both sides. 

Or do you believe in collective guilt?"
Didn't Israel capture the West Bank from Jordan?
"I am not the liar here. 

What does your comment have to do with Palestine rejecting a two state solution that has been offered to them for decades. 

The two state solutions Israel offered included ending all new settlements. Why does Palestine refuse?"
Nah you are the liar
[deleted]
"Palestine could have had peace with those deals, but they chose constant terrorism."
"I think if any part of this conflict was obvious and easy, it wouldn't have lasted for over 80 years.  

If your defense is ""trust me bro"" I'll give it as much stock as anything the orange haired man says."
"Oh that totally makes sense why Israel is bombing churches and residential buildings slaughtering kids in the process. 

Those kids are covering up for the rich Gaza leaders in Qatar"
You dropped your tin foil hat
"Off topic, but sure. Gaza shouldn't be recognised with terrorists at the helm.

Doesn't change that we're one of the few countries not to recognise the West Bank, and calling for a two state solution when we've actively acted against it is hypocrisy."
"Problem is there's no trust. Last time a large amount of people were displaced they weren't allowed to go back. Can't see them accepting to simoly be moved.

Then Israel claims it needs those checkpoints for security, which is partially true. Can't build off of a relationship with no trust, and most international powers having no interest in solving the issue."
Casually calling for mass expulsion. The sheer arrogance is disturbing.
[removed]
"I mean, I want Constantinople back but that's what happens when you lose a bunch of wars."
"Because it's also the Jewish ancestral homeland. They have as much claim to it as the Palestinian people. In fact they were there first and the Palestinian people colonized the area after most of the Jewish people were enslaved and forcibly removed and it was renamed Palestine.

All the people there have a claim to the land. Pretending that the Jewish people have no right to be there is asinine and no path to peace. The only path to peace is for the Palestinian people to accept the right of a Jewish state to exist and negotiate borders with them. But that is something they absolutely refuse to do."
"No it’s like going into your old house you rented, you were evicted by many different neighbours and after many years the new tenants are mad that you came back when you asked to share the house as a semi detached."
No point in mediation if there is no middle ground
"“Wasn’t good enough”

they literally expelled nearly 1million Palestinians in the Nakba in the 40s, why the hell would they accept it when the occupation of their population’s homes and land was happening in real time? If someone displaced a million Canadians out of their homes and gave them a smaller land with more concentrated population how well would that go over? Why dont you try it and see how much animosity and spite you would feel."
"That time, they understandably rejected the plan because they viewed it as a big land takeover.

All the ""peace offers"" later were a joke. You can check their details."
Did you hear me?
"> The current government is very right wing.

That's why up until Hamas attacked, there were regular mass protests against this government. 

Hamas gave the hawks a big ol' gift-wrapped all-eight-days-of-hanukkah present. Nobody protesting Bibi now. :("
">OK, so do you call for all religious states to be abolished

Yes. I don't understand why that's framed as a trick question?"
Guess if Russia gives notice before bombing Ukraine or bin Ladin throwing warning fireworks for people to evacuate towers before ramming planes makes it all good and dandy then? Gtfo.
"Peacekeepers aren't in place to take a side or advocate, they're there to keep/evacuate innocents out of combat zones"
"They've agreed to multiple proposed versions of a two-state solution. 

What do you think you gain by just outright lying to people?"
The West Bank belonged to Jordan the first time war was declared on Israel.
">Israel has never stopped expanding illegal settlements 

Misinformation. The West Bank didn't even originally belong to Israel."
They drafted up the state of Isreal 3000 years ago? I didn't realize the western allies have been together that long.
">Yes the room is very well aware that America and her colonies all fall in line when it comes to the promise of the Christian prophecy

Lol, the Christian countries of Japan, Korea and Thailand don't recognize Palestine either."
"What's your solution to peace in the middle east, then?"
Except NATO has both a larger economy and military than the rest of the world combined. So yes. NATO is quite important. Also Canada has a larger economy than Russia. Economic power is arguably the most valuable today.
Population doesn’t mean much. Power does. Mostly hard power but even some soft power. Population can help with hard power but isn’t a given
America is more powerful that the other 4 combined and it's not even close.
UK?
"Russia has a smaller economy than Canada. So no, they are irrelevant.

Neither China nor India have a single soldier that has seen active combat, nor do they have any military projection outside of their own borders.

Nobody cares about billions of people in the third world that are unproductive and have no money. They have no global power or influence.

NATO and the G7 run the world, that’s the reality. 

That’s why NATO countries have ships, soldiers and tanks stationed all over the Middle East, while China and India aren’t allowed."
Money is power. Canada has a larger economy than russia. How about do it by what percentage of global GDP recognizes Palestine
That was all fine and dandy until they tried a redo in 1973.
Becauae respectful is exactly what comes to mind when someone mentions the FLQ
"The FLQ kidnapped a British diplomat. They also kidnapped and killed Pierre Laporte, a Minister in the Quebec legislature. The War Measures Act was enacted and soldiers roamed the province during this time. I would call that an upheaval, and the election of the separatist Parti Quebecois was a backlash against the anglophone establishment. It was crazy to grow up there at that time."
"The user you are replying to is probably referring to the whole domestic terrorism and War Measures Act thing, not banks moving offices..."
Yes. That was be biggest issue during that time. Not the separatists putting bombs in mailboxes and being domestic terrorists.
I also don't remember Ontario bombing the shit out of Quebec or removing the French from their homes and putting Ontarian settlers in by force.
Regardless another country suggested Canada should adopt a two state solution for itself.
I meant that it's ironic for Canada to tell another country to adopt a two state solution given Canada's history and abject unwillingness to consider a two state solution for itself.
"I know in some places where Muslims are the majority, hatred of Christians is a thing. 

No idea how wide spread though."
"Authentic pious Muslims dont. The reason being that Jesus is featured in the Quran as a prophet. Hes just not the most important one. So the amount of criticism they can give to Christians for following Jesus is limited by the fact that they cant disparage Jesus or his teachings, as this would be blasphemy.   


Pious Jews, its prettymuch the same thing except its Abraham featured in the Bible that limits their criticism."
I'm just referencing Armageddon prophecies for /s. Abrahamic religions believe in a great war towards the end of time / during the apocalypse.
"Christians have a bad time in many Muslim nations.  See Egypt and Pakistan as examples.

Jews are fine with Christians.  Christians in Israel are fine.  Christians in Egypt and Iraq are f\*cked."
The Jews (in Israel anyway) seem to dislike both equally.
Yes
I prefer the gender queer-Jordan they party til 7 in the morning
Pretty sure most of the land is already flat - yr also talking about land that billions consider holy.
Ismail Haniyeh is estimated to be worth 4 billion.
"Incorrect. 

https://www.science.org/content/article/did-modern-jews-originate-italy

Anyway, racial heritage doesn't matter in this argument, it's more religious and cultural IMO.

But the point stands that most Jewish families in Israel immigrated there in about the past 100 years and weren't there before that. That's kind of how you create a country of transplanted individuals."
"The 1947 UN partition plan (Resolution 181) was actually 3 states. It included a Jewish state, an Arab state, and an independent state for Jerusalem."
I was thinking 0
Try United States ?
"Totally true. These posters acting like Palestinians ever really wanted any peace are out to lunch. They don't want peace, are told not to by Hezbollah, Hamas, Iran. They are the problem."
"The official position of Palestine is that of the leader of the PLO. Its based on a two state solution since early 90s, Hamas took power in a coup and only represents itself."
[deleted]
Don’t expect much from these people
Moving the goal post…glad you finally admitted Israel attacked first. I suggest you read some more about the history especially if you’re looking to engage in honest dialogue online.
"What would you prefer then... Open air prisons with no release date? Complete with barbed wire, concrete fences and armed guards.

They serve exactly the same purpose."
You mean the deal where an Israeli pm negotiated a peace deal which was withdrawal  because he was assassinated by a far right Israeli for it which netenyahu all but encouraged?
">The population of Gaza is growing rapidly. They ain't starving or suffocating.

Oh yeah I'm sure it's a paradise. Not at all dependent on external aid for virtually everything.

If it was Jewish people on the inside and Arabs on the outside I'm sure you'd be saying the exact same thing, right?"
The west bank has. How has that been working out?
">Hamas hasn't tried that yet.

The residents of Gaza did try that in 2018-2019 with what they called the ""Great March of Return"". It got them over 200 dead, over 9,000 injured and exactly zero progress otherwise."
">Killing innocent civilians is wrong. For both sides. 

I agree. 

>Or do you believe in collective guilt?

I don't"
"Does Palestinians celebrating what a terrorist group does, warrants their annihilation?

Can't wait for Iran to join the chat room. /S"
"The same way Ukraine could just accept Russia's peace offer and avoid war, right?"
"No, in fact, don't trust me bro. Do your own research. Find evidence to prove me wrong. Start thinking by yourslef instead of just sharing fucking propaganda, and we'll have a discussion."
That is where Hamas hides and launches rockets from.
"everything he stated is a known fact, not a conspiracy"
"I get it.

I'm just trying to put forward some outside the box thinking that could lead to a stable solution."
"Transfer, not expulsion.

May as well do it in an orderly manner rather what is about to happen in a week or so."
"The Jews were forced off their land (in Judah), pushed north (through what's thought to be the Kingdom of Israel, jury is still out on that one unfortunately) and enslaved by the Assyrians around \~730 BCE.

We know this because the Assyrians actually wrote it down. Sargon II recorded the mass deportation.

The Merneptah Stele in Egypt dated back to around \~1200 BCE even mentions an ""Israel"" from one of the Pharaoh's successful conquests during a campaign in Canaan.

Anyone denying that the Jews don't have a claim there or aren't indigenous to the area are completely cracked as far as I'm concerned. I've learned more history about the area then I've ever cared to thanks to all the disinfo flying around.

\*Edit: Mixed up my kings: Nebuchadnezzar II destroyed Jerusalem and Judah with it, not Sargon II. Sargon II did the mass deportation."
"You’re mixing the way things happened. Israel and Palestine was established, Palestinians and all neighboring countries attacked Israel, in a bloody war, many Palestinians fled, expecting to return when the war ends (regardless of the outcome), Israel pushed out villages that were deemed hostile and ones that attacked Israeli forces, that’s how you got 700,000 refugees. Not the other way around."
"Yes yes yes we all know.
You should understand no one is sympathetic to this. Many many people have been displaced. The 20th century was very traumatic for many. 
My grandparents lost their homes, loved ones, and fled war. Big deal get over it."
"I did. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel#Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict

Arabs wanting all Jews removed from the Middle East is not a joke."
Hamas is a proxy for Iran and Qatar. They don't act in Palestinian interests. I'm guessing the situation being perpetually violent benefits them somehow.
Show me in your post history where you called for a state other than Israel to be abolished.
"You gtfo, trying to justify mass murder and rape; no matter what Hamas is not in the right"
"I didn't say they were, they're there to keep the peace and protect civilians."
">They've agreed to multiple proposed versions of a two-state solution.

I: ""We'll agree to let you have 95% of your land""   
P: ""No.  100%""  

I: ""How about 80%?""   
P: ""No.  100%""   

I: ""How about 65%?""   
P: ""No.  100%""   

I: ""How about 0%?""   

> What do you think you gain by just outright lying to people?

Is a two-state option even on the table anymore, or has Israel made it wholly impossible?"
">The West Bank belonged to Jordan

So Israel shouldn't be there at all, should they?"
"So you're actually confirming my ""misinformation""?   
  
Typical propagandist"
[removed]
"Great question, my bet is no one has any answers, sure the U.S has issues like a lot, but who do you want Russia, China, or any major ME country?  Sadly this issue IMO will never come to an equal solution.  Too many bad faith actors on all sides, with skin in the game to jeep this going. Worse for me, is watching protests on both sides, with people in Canada, deflecting all wrong doing to the other side. This is going to get worse, and no one wins. Well maybe shareholders and military companies. Ugh"
"Well realistically the Western backed Israel needs to give up contested territories to Palestine.

An international zone needs to be established in the area between Gaza and Palestine, making sure to contain the shared religious sites of the two groups there.

Throw some UN peacekeeping forces into Jerusalem and you're probably good to go with peace in the east.

However this solution gives no one what they want and only brings about less civilian casualties so it probably won't be the solution used."
"Maybe start by redrawing borders and administrations around ethnic and religious borders, stop western meddling, corruption and instability promotion, and maybe provide Palestinians with self determination?

It’s funny because it was China that essentially brokered peace between Iran and Saudi Arabia this year. That only serves to show not only the west is in decline, but the solution was do-able meaning either instability was in NATOs interests, or they’re incompetent."
"The middle east doesn't even think there will be peace in the middle east, my friend"
You're talking to a bot just to let you know... Or the most efficient Reddit poster of all time.
"And again. The only countries that matter with those standards are the UK, US, Russia, China and India lmao Every other country is just a stooge of one of those five."
Israel attacked first in 1973
"The PQ was a backlash against the establishment, not the Anglo establishment. 

People forget the FLQ manifesto was directed against what it called the “Simard-Cotroni election riggers,” and the Demarais family run Power Corp. The FLQ almost never mentioned Anglos."
"That's not a backlash to the referendum though, which is what the original comment was talking about"
"If Quebec fired missiles at Ontario, committed terrorist attacks, abducted thousands of hostages, would the government of Canada have a right to respond? Ontarians can move freely into Quebec because it's the same country. Palestine hasn't agreed to borders, and is therefore part of Israel for now."
"And Canada did. Harper made Quebec, “a nation within a nation.” Two state (or multiple state) solutions have been used around the world. Czechia and Slovakia, Serbia, Croatia, Republic of Ireland and the UK, etc..

If Israel and Palestine were united as one state the separation movements would start immediately. 

The best chance at peace was the Camp David Summit. It’s really too bad Arafat rejected it."
"We let separatist have a referendum to leave and they can do so again at any time, they just don't want to.

In what universe is that ""abject unwillingness""?

Also, are you saying he should be instead suggesting a one state solution, because that's much worse for Israel than two states, or are you saying he should suggest nothing at all?"
"Except Canada has, peacefully, on many occasions. But you know this."
Don't fundamentalists everywhere hate all other religions?
"*checks geography* 

Majority Muslim population/ minor Christian population in Lebanon and Jordan. No issues."
"In many areas, Christians moved out as Muslims moved in. Those areas have totally changed."
"As an arab that comes from an Arabic country with a sizable Christian population, and lived there, even if there's tensions, it's political, we don't hate Christians."
"That’s a lie.. Christian Palestinians have a very hard time a second class citizens. In fact, the number of Christian’s in the West Bank decreases every year due to the lack of rights, opportunity and security. 
SOURCE: from a catholic palestinian"
"I doubt that Christians get too much of a rough time from the Jews. Many Muslims living in Gaza had jobs in Israel before the massacre. 

That is definitely over now."
I'm all for equality
Not true at all.
Could make it a polished granite slab like a certain place in Japan.
"There is a branch, if that is what it is called, that originated in Iran.  The link you sent is that branch.   They likely share common ancestors.  

My understanding is the borders in all of eastern europe and Russia changed after ww2.  At that time the Ukraine was part of Russia.  And Russia was in Iran.  Britain was in Iraq and elsewhere.  Lots of peoples were displaced and migrated to new places as they have through human history.

There is no time machine that will take the world back to 1947.  Or to ww1 for that matter."
"Ok that’s total misinformation, referencing a 10 year old article too really!?!?

[the truth](https://hms.harvard.edu/news/ancient-dna-provides-new-insights-ashkenazi-jewish-history)"
"That would have been, relatively speaking, awesome. 

Wouldn't have solved everything of course, but sure would have been better than 75 years of this crap."
And the Jews there accepted that plan. The Arabs didn’t and subsequently tried to annihilate the Jews.
Whos they? Stop generalizing fool Hamas doesn't represent Palestinians or Palestine. The official position of the PLO which is the sole and only representative of the Palestinian people is based on a two state solution based on supposed mutual respect
They were elected. Now we can debate the freedom of that election - but that also would support Israel’s concern with their safety vis-a-vis Gaza. Who would Israel be negotiating with?
"So you're not trying to ask a question, but rather push your agenda. 

Because humans were horrible in the past we should continue to be so?

So merciful is Israel letting civilians die by airstrike. 

So merciful is an apartheid state.

So merciful is cultural genocide and ethnic cleansing."
The guy above you is probably imagining Nazi camps rather than the hundreds of examples of decidedly less cruel concentration camps that rarely get coverage.
"Considering that Palestinians living in the West Bank have visa free access to Jordan, I don't think they really count at all."
Somehow nobody seems to remember that Egypt has the other border -- which is also closed. Of course it's only Israel's fault...
"Gaza should spend some of its aid money on things like education, healthcare, infrastructure, technology… instead of whatever the fuck Hamas wastes it on. Then maybe give the rockets a break for a year and see what can happen when neighbours get along. Hell, Palestinians in gaza could go shopping in Israel as late as 2022 until Hamas decided it would be fun throwing 1200 rockets into Israel over 2 days time."
[deleted]
When?
"it is so nice that antisemites like you come out of the woods.

these peaceful protests contained shit like: 

> In one incident, two Palestinian gunmen approached the fence, armed with AK-47 assault rifles and hand grenades, and exchanged fire with IDF soldiers

and this was the opening day... lovely!

stop stop! Let them support a genocide in peace you are hurting them with facts!

"You made a statement, I asked you to back it up, and you told me to do my own research.  What even is this....

Do my own research?  For my own question?  Sure.  Done.  Check out the Hamas Charter. Guess I just proved you wrong, especially since you won't even bother to back up anything your saying. 

But again I literally asked questions for you to elaborate, the burden of proof is 100% on you - you made the statement.  Failure to back it up is like me saying that you wear stinky socks, and demanding you to prove you don't.  

Man, this is painful having to explain the very basics."
"According to Israel…

I too take the words of criminals as the truth when crimes are committed. 

Is Hamas hiding and launching rockets inside the bodies of kids too? Is that why Israel needed to bomb them to oblivion?"
"These are human beings, not boxes to be moved."
"Your “solution” is called ethnic displacement, an international crime. 

Also, the Israeli government has made clear they have no desire to ever let go of the West Bank or actually give the Palestinians already living there rights. The Second class citizenship is by design."
"1- With the illegal terrorist settlements in the WB expanding, there isn’t room for 2.5 million Gazans
2- Calling expulsion a “transfer” is putting lipstick on a pig"
"OMG, guys. This guy has a Wikipedia link. Trust his intellect and knowledge of a war halfway across the world. /s"
"Yeah, I know. It's hard to fix crazy. :(

And now Gaza has had almost 20 years of being basically a terrorist training camp. :("
"I've never posted about any state being abolished on reddit, religious or otherwise."
"Stop deflecting when you can't respond .No one justifying anything here. But if you're so worried about mass murder and rape , better start looking at IDFs record. So yeah GTFOH"
"It wasn't Israel that made that impossible,it was the terrorist attack by Hamas"
"It's the same country, in the same place, with the same cities, temples, and populated largely by direct descendants."
"It sounds like you want to impose a peace settlement detrimental to the interests of the country that has won every war it has ever fought over its right to exist. I don't think that is going to work, somehow."
"Palestine has been offered a state, so I don't think self determination is really in question here.

China brokering a peace deal between two countries, one of which is an enemy of NATO and the other which is an ally of the US is hardly indicative of NATO's impotence."
"Totally agree. But if you are going to shoot down the solution our government and most of our allies support, you should probably offer a better one."
"So which countries are France and Germany ""stooges"" of?"
It’s much easier to think of NATO then all the individual western countries
LOL. USA and uk are the two closest aligned states on the planet. Expect maybe Canada and USA. Your comment literally means nothing.
"Except if you’re a member of NATO then you automatically have more power than China, India, or Russia because it’s a collective defence.

And sorry, nobody takes the word of China seriously at all. They have zero diplomatic respect. Canada (despite Trudeau) does."
They Yom Kippur War famously started with a surprise attack by Egypt. You must be thinking of some other war.
"But again, you're ignoring that there are two sides, or at least pretending that only one has ever been the aggressor here. 

You're right that Ontarians are free to come and go as they please in Quebec however they are not permitted to walk into your home, kick you out and claim the land is now theirs. 

This war didn't start yesterday and is most certainly not as simple as good vs evil. 

The head honchos of both sides need to get locked in a room somewhere until they can figure this shit out. Sick of watching innocents die because of some shit written thousands of years ago."
If it's a part of israel why don't the Palestinians in the west bank have citizenships?
"Ah you're picking a fight by engaging in mind reading and assuming I have hidden agendas behind my words.

I think you should lay off the Internet for a while until you calm down. Maybe go on a walk."
"I suppose you could call me a fundamentalist Christian, but I don’t hate other religions (unless they’re inherently exploitative like Scientology)."
"Christians where I live, even friends of mine, underneath it all, truly believe I'm going to burn in hell for all eternity for not being Christian."
"Bit of survivorship bias no?

Iraqi and Syrian Christians did no fare so well.

""Iraq was estimated to have nearly 1.5 million Christians before the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein. They date back to the first centuries of the religion and include Chaldean, Syriac, Assyrian and Armenian churches.

Now, church officials estimate only a few hundred thousand, or even less, remain within Iraq’s borders.""

"Oh yeah, Lebanon is doing great, Hezbollah is fantastic."
"There was a relatively recent civil war in Lebanon during which Christian and Muslim militias regularly attacked each other so this isn’t entirely true. It is part of the reason I was raised around a bunch of Maronite and Catholic Lebanese refugees. Nowadays, it has gotten better.

I have no frame of reference for Jordan."
"The West Bank isn't in Israel, and its residents are not (necessarily) citizens nor residents of Israel.

Muslim and Christian Palestinians have had at least three separate opportunities to have the their own state where they could rule themselves.  They rejected all such opportunities.  They would rather eradicate Israel."
Well before all this kicked off I saw a video of what appeared to be orthodox jews spitting on christians while just walking down the street.
"No, you can't go back and change what's happened.

You certainly can't resolve it by pretending one side doesn't exist, or by trying to exterminate them."
Palestine rejected the proposal and made it their mandate to eradicate Israel. Leading to where we've been for the last 75yrs
"Hamas definitely represents Palestinians, you realize that Hamas is the voted in government of Gaza?

Are you a liar?

The PA in the west bank still supports the pay to slay system so quit with the mutual respect thing, it isn't true."

"[https://www.britannica.com/topic/concentration-camp](https://www.britannica.com/topic/concentration-camp)

>Concentration camp, internment centre for political prisoners and members of national or minority groups who are confined for reasons of state security, exploitation, or punishment, usually by executive decree or military order. Persons are placed in such camps often on the basis of identification with a particular ethnic or political group rather than as individuals and without benefit either of indictment or fair trial. Concentration camps are to be distinguished from prisons interning persons lawfully convicted of civil crimes and from prisoner-of-war camps in which captured military personnel are held under the laws of war. They are also to be distinguished from refugee camps or detention and relocation centres for the temporary accommodation of large numbers of displaced persons.

Fits the definition perfectly."
"Yeah, sure all they have to do is cross a few dozen of the [140 Israeli checkpoints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:West_Bank_Access_Restrictions_June_2020.pdf) in the West Bank. Easy!"
It's closed because they can't/won't support millions of refugees. And I guarantee that they wouldn't be let back into Gaza by Israel so Egypt would have to take care of millions. They have their own problems.
The West Bank is a Soviet style eastern block surveillance state. You can’t go to the grocery store without going through 3 check points each way.
Better then an open air prison isn't a very high bar. Isreal has craved the west bank to shit with high walls and highways. So I'm not sure what you are talking about.
The last 20 yrs. Hamas isn't in the west bank and the PLO hasn't engaged in violence for decades. How has that been working out? Has Isreal put a hold on settlements? Worked towards peace?
">antisemites

Nice try. There’s a reason why that dog is hunting less and less. You should read your own link, btw.

>Most of the demonstrators demonstrated peacefully far from the border fence. Peter Cammack, a fellow with the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, argued that the march indicated a new trend in Palestinian society and Hamas, with a shift away from violence towards non-violent forms of protest."
">its funny you went from ""they don't want to destroy Israel""

What I think you're referencing to ->""Don't you think 99% of the population is just trying to live but is unable to because of apartheid-like conditions?""

> to ""even if they do it doesn't mean Israel can fight back"" 

Really lol ? ->""Does Palestinians celebrating what a terrorist group does, warrants their annihilation?""

The part about Iran is litteraly an escalation. If Israel bombs hospitals and civilians after 1200 deaths, I wonder what it will do if Iran finally gets its feet wet instead of sending small militias. Nukes? 

Anyhow, shalom petty redditor."
"Meh, hard pass. I honestly don't care enough to have that discussion again. You'll have to prove you understand the difference between the palestinian people and hamas first. It's futile if you don't."
"Exactly. They have legs and can walk to move themselves.

In any case, Gaza, as a settlement for Palestinians, is reaching its end."
Settlers in the West Bank can move out as well to make room.
"Support for terrorist organizations has no place in Canada, you are the one deflecting and the one in the wrong. Yes there are atrocities committed by both sides, but there is a difference between collateral damage and directly targeting civilians."

"And who are those direct descendants?

Palestinians.

Regardless, there's a massive difference between 3000 years and 55 years"
"War is a very big stretch for such a one sided engagement, they've realistically been given the area by the west they haven't won it in battle or anything. 

If all the money and weapon shipments to Israel stopped all of a sudden they would need to come to the peace table very quickly or make major alterations to their society. They are a propped up nation by Uncle Sam, they do not stand on their own two feet."
"Offering a state after large swaths of their territory was rightfully stolen is not an offer, it’s pittance. 

In response the Israelis do to the gazans what they were fleeing from in Germany.

Brokering a deal between two hostile nations is very telling of NATO. Simply because the US is NATO."
"Especially France, which is the only veto-wielding, nuclear armed country that didn't make their list."
"Haha who's picking a fight here? You're the one making what is a totally uncontroversial statement an issue

Why don't you just explain why there's anything wrong with suggesting a two state solution in Israel instead of expecting people to read your mind?

Just say it.

The only other two options is a one state solution, which is bad for Israel, and perpetual war until the Palestinians are wiped out.

Which of those two solutions is better than a two state solution in your mind?

Dodging this simple question is pretty bizarre. Why would it be a fight?"
Some Christian religions like the  United Church and the Anglicans don't take the Bible as literally as others.  And are tolerate of others.
"Iraq was estimated to have nearly 1.5M BEFORE US- led invasion…. 

Yeah so because of the US… 

lol are Muslims at fault for the US led invasion?"
Orthodox Jews don’t even like other Jews.
Not to mention a bunch of Arab states attacking Israel and losing 3 times.
"80% of the population rejecting 45% of the land, who in their right mind would have taken that deal?"
Does Ukraine except Russias proposals to take their land?
"> Any other culture would have exterminated them decades ago.

Israel has essentially been trying to drive them off the land and do just that. But let's not kid ourselves, the reality is Israel cannot, not without consequences- because the entire Arab and Muslim world is watching, and many other nations formerly colonized are watching too.

It's like how apartheid South Africa, Rhodesia, French Algeria, British settler-colonials in Kenya, etc. all couldn't simply go ""exterminate them all."" Turns out that people don't tend to like it when their ethnic and racial kin are being discriminated against in an apartheid state, and like it even less when they are being actively genocided; those who have experienced similar (such as the Irish and South Africans) also tend to stand against it, as well as anyone with a smidgen of human decency.

Imagine if the tables had been turned- if the Palestinians conquered and settled over the UK, and the English were subjected to the same suffering and brutality the Palestinians continue to face, while subjected to living in mere slivers of what land they once had, and facing constant encroachment.

Do you think that the rest of western Europe and the Anglosphere would simply sit by and deem it remotely acceptable, as this took place- or worse, if a ""extermination"" (read: total genocide) the likes of which you say Israel is apparently ""generous"" to ""spare"" the Palestinians, was underway?"
It can take up to 4 hours to cross one checkpoint during rush hour.
"When a population promised the genocide of you, would you not take measures against it?"
"Funnily enough, so does Israel.  

And no other states are willing to take them either. Not Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq...

And other than Jordan for awhile, no other states are willing to give descendants of past Palestinian refugees citizenship either. Just perpetual refugee-ship.

There aren't any realistically good solutions right now. I'll always welcome a miracle.... :("

and most demonstrators were not shot.
"Ok, I'll pretend you aren't putting up roadblocks out of bad faith, but seriously, truly believe what you are saying.  last chance.

Palestine - the people with a long history of living in that area.

Hamas - a terrorist organization that not everyone in Palestine supports.

Now, I've gone through every hoop you asked - answer the questions or stop wasting my time."
"I think you see this as a video game or movie where people are moved, with nowhere to go."
"Terrorist Settlers are in WB illegally, they should absolutely leave as the land isn’t theirs. Expelling Gazans from their land and homes is just wrong."
"Keep barking about supporting terrorist organizations. No one here is supporting Hamas but when pointing at the atrocities IDF commits you start throwing that card around. That IS deflection in its purest form. There is nothing different between Hamas and IDF, except one side is deluded enough to think they have the moral high ground"
Cool? I'm sure somehow that justifies terrorism to you.
"If a group of people called themselves Romans for 2000 years, were forced out of their land, maintained their same Roman identity, then returned to that same land and reclaimed it, then yes it would be the same country."
"As the UN was partitioning Palestine, Israel declared independence, which is a thing that nations are allowed to do, particularly when that declaration is backed by arms.

Groups of Arab states tried to undo that in 1947, 1967, and 1973. They lost decisively each time. 

I agree they get massive military and other support from the United States, but so does Ukraine, and no one serious is denying their right to exist as a country."
"No kidding, France has a shit ton more power than China, India, or Russia. 

France has numerous overseas territories in every ocean, and a global projection of force. 

They have naval bases in the Pacific within reach of China. France is also a global leader in military innovation and arms exports.

China, India, and Russia have none of that."
Christ you're triggered.
"Maybe read the article? Main reasons were they fled the Islamic extremists that were massacring them in the late 2000's and early 2010's; with another major outflow happening following ISIS. 

But of course the U.S. is at fault because as soon as the dictator keeping everyone in line is removed Iraqi Christian's Muslim neighbours start slaughtering them. America bad.

When the same thing happened in Syria was that also America's fault?"

"They played double or nothing and lost. They rejected land that was under the British mandate, not really theirs to begin with."
"The first proposal gave arabs 52% of the land. They would have had a majority of land. But instead they got greedy, attacked israel and lost. Making any land israel won in 1948, 1967 and 1973 legally Israeli."
Not at ALL similar

">Funnily enough, so does Israel.

And yet they were the ones who created the situation.

Who knew that displacing people from their homes and creating a new state excluding them would make them homeless and stateless.

Well... Israel knew. They just hoped some one would solve their problem."
I don’t know who is making that claim but it isn’t me
You can compare them and Gaza is significantly worse. Part of it is geography with the west bank have fertile land which is always going to make life easier. But it is not accurate to say that the West bank is truly open. They are still under apartheid.
"They're both fucked. Palestinians have to wait up to 4 hours in Israeli checkpoints to get to work every day.

They live under constant fear of settlers roaming in groups shooting at them. They can't defend themselves because they obviously dont have guns and the IDF just watches the settlers kill them."
I don't think that's accurate. Hamas has had periods where it hasn't used violence but it has never been non violent
[removed]
"My comment was:

>That's rich when you realize Israel is the only state threatening the existence of the opposing side.

Meaning, people of Palestine living under apartheid conditions, now unable to access water, food, medicine, will probably be decimated by bombing and humanitarian crisis, due to Israel's 'defense'.

>Wait, is Hamas not in control of Gaza?

Yes, in conctrol since its election in 2007. Median age in palestine being 19.5 yo, \[present time\] median person was 2 the last time there was an election. So basically almost nobody \[still living\] in Palestine voted for Hamas.

>Or are they willing to hug it out with Jews and no longer wipe them off the planet?

I mean, they probably won't. But trying to exterminate them won't work. It will only exacerbate their anger, and produce the next generation of terrorists.

E: added some \[ \] for context"
"No.

I just see the 300,000+ IDF troops and all the other firepower being built up around Gaza as a clear sign that Gazan people won't have a choice in the matter.

Something big is happening soon."
Tit for tat. I see it as a fair exchange. It rids Israel of a thorn in their side. Regroups most palestiniens in one territory and creates a potentially viable state.
"Maybe the group that just committed delivered mass murder, rape and specifically went after civilians doesn’t get to claim the moral high ground, and I do condemn any IDF soldiers committing war crimes.

That say the one deflecting here is you, pretending that all the protest that have occurred in Canada are not celebrating the atrocities that Hamas committed, so yeah fuck Hamas and any apologists like you"
The only people justifying terrorism here are the zionists and when it's done by Israel.
"“*It's now very common to hear people say, 'I'm rather offended by that.' As if that gives them certain rights. It's actually nothing more... than a whine. 'I find that offensive.' It has no meaning; it has no purpose; it has no reason to be respected as a phrase. 'I am offended by that.' Well, so fucking what.*""

Mind you by this point it would appear that those in power in Israel are liable to be offended by anyone merely existing and not promptly pledging 100% unconditional support regardless of circumstances.

"Imagine someone being pissed that you asked them to chill just a bit after killing over 5,000 children."

I see nothing wrong with what Trudeau said. If Israel is upset then maybe their far-right government needs to look at themselves in a mirror...
Aww so sorry we hurt his feelings.
Man they’ve really turned playing the victim into an art form
How about he go F himself
"Oh no! Anyway, …"
"Well I'm offended by mass civilian casualties, so..."
Using restraint when it comes to killing innocent civilians? That offends the Israeli PM? Well isn’t that very telling.
"As much as I can understand attacking Hamas for their transgression, bombing a refugee camp to kill one senior leader just ain’t it. So the worlds smallest violin."
Nothing as offensive as a bit of human decency.
Tough shit Israel. Or Israeli government to be more accurate. I have a huge amount of sympathy for the Israeli people but their government is absolutely monstrous.
Don't tell them Palestinians are human beings too. That'll REALLY get em mad.
Go kick sand
I'm surprised that Trudeau wasn't called out for being antisemitic.  Seems to be the norm if anyone challenges that side of the conflict.
Who the fuck cares

"take literally one minute of your time and listen to how Bibi talks about the us. The full clip was available until recently on YouTube and was quite popular when it came out, and Obama was in office. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7PyhTEQYtQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7PyhTEQYtQ)

"Too fucking bad. Israel didn't elect him. ""Maximum restraint"" understates the will of the majority of Canadians. The people he actually represents."
So what
"Israel is so much better at human rights, so much better at communication, and of course so much better at killing."
🙄🙄 how sensitive can you be
"A call for maximum restraint is the best advice anyone could possibly give Israel in this moment, and Bibi takes offense. He is so clearly not the right man for the job right now"
When a terrorist apartheid state engaging in genocide is offended then for once Trudeau did something right.
"Boo hoo.

We're offended by senseless killing of civilians."
"Hmmm, offended for what? The audacity of defying those who are supposed to control him and his party with donations and threats?

Or offended that he had the audacity to ask them to maximize restraint when the stated goal is annihilation and the total annexation of Gaza, to loot its trillion dollars worth of oil that they already contracted out the drilling services to earlier this year in a public tender?

Either way, he is not listening correctly, it's not enough to just obey orders and vote against a ceasefire declaration in the UN.

I am sure they can't weight for Pollievre's sweet lips to be wrapped around his little weiner... nothing like conservative sellouts.... liberal sellouts are temperamental...."
"Well, civillian casualties and levelled neighbourhoods offend me."
Oh boo hoo...
He can fuck off then. Having your own civilians killed doesn’t justify killing other civilians.
"*""You should try to keep civilian casualties to an absolute minimum.""*

*""Your opinion offends me!""*"
"Trudeau ""Stop the killing""

Israel ""that is offensive""

Says it all"
"Did they think our prime minister was that rootin tootin Texan from the Looney Toons cartoons, and he’d start firing pistols wildly into the air?"
Israel is taking a page from India and China I see.
I agree with JT!
I can't believe how many times I have agreed with Trudeau since this shit has started.
Supporting the Netenyahu government could only have gone one way.
"I fully support the right of Israel to not only defend itself, but to launch a counteroffensive against the terrorists who attacked them on October 7th.

I also fully support the use of reasonable language in diplomatic interactions like ""maximum restraint"" because that causes zero harm. How could it?

Then again, I've opposed Bibi since he first started campaigning for his first term. He's always been a warhawk with fluid morality. The 800,000 Israelis who gathered to protest against his policies earlier this year agree with me.

This is a total non-story."
"If we could insert gifs here, this is definitely where I'd insert that ""First time?"" gif from *The Ballad of Buster Scruggs*."
"Framing Hamas as an Empire of Evil is certainly something. Don't get me wrong, Hamas is a vile organization that the world would be much better off without. But they're terrorists making rockets out of water pipes in a blockaded ghetto. It's a Reed Richards type stretch to call them an Empire. Just Israel trying to reframe the conflict to make themselves the underdog despite the fact that they're the modern military with a budget in the tens of billions up against, again, terrorists with improvised weapons."
Too freaking bad.
Why should Canadians care if he offended Israel? Trudeau isn't beholden to Israel and neither are the Canadian people. If Israel wants our support then they should listen to our leaders.
Go pound stand. You are making Canadians like Trudeau again.
"look at these assholes... 

they are shameless and they know they shamelessly play the anti-semitic card too"
PM Bibi and his government will be toasted and tossed out soon enough.  Thousands of children have been killed and Israel is offended by our PM asking them to chill the fuck out. Who gives a shit what Israel says at this point. I don't like JT but he should say more.
"Well, when you have tanks, armoured troop carriers, guided missiles, jets, drones, flecettes, satellites, and 3 billion in usa subsidies a year....maybe?"
"I don't care.

If either group gets its way there will be a tsunami of genocides and state-endorsed mass murders across the planet. Probably corporations will slip their leash and just start doing it outright.

This is not a comprehensive list of the groups that will."
It really does feel like Israel is yet to unveil the true scale of atrocities they have planned for Palestinians
Hamas has infiltrated Trudeau clearly they built a tunnel to his house.
"I’m still trying to get this clip out of my head (no gore or violence, just talk):

"Canada has an ugly history of forcing people off their land. Don't go down that road, Israel."
They demand total support. Hamas is terrible but Israel has gone too far.
Good they have to know when they take it too far. If we and the world say nothing they will not stop and they will murder all of gaza

"It’s political posturing, Israel doesn’t care what Trudeau thinks at all. They will act how they believe they need to."
"Old news now, but I find it strange that many are just focusing on what he said about Israel & not that he equally spoke against HAMAS."
Oh no.
"It implies that Israel doesn't already use maximum restraint, which it clearly does. They gave people three weeks to clear out of northern Gaza, giving up all strategic advantage, roof knocks, leaflet drops, you name it, everything to save civilian lives."
"If someone committed a terrorist attack that killed 6,400 Canadians (Same proportional death toll as Oct 7), I can imagine that Canadians would be upset if they were getting outside commentary from other nations. Even if they are right.

My wife hates it when I tell her to ""calm down"" when she's mad (even when I'm right). I can imagine this has the same effect on a national scale too."
"Well Israel should show restraint.  Israelis are not barbarians, so their government should not act like one either."
At this point who doesn’t JT offend.
"Thankfully, Israel ignored Trudeau."
Of course he did. He’s a fucking idiot who panders to whatever he thinks signals the most virtue
Good
Is there any country that he hasn't pissed off yet?
"Trudeau can’t help but offend every country, he’s a piece of work!"
You don't have to listen to Canada if he's not your daddy.
I think the offense was in the presumption that Israel is not already applying maximum restraint (as much as possible without sacrificing any legitimate goals).
Trudeau is an idiot.  Netanyahu is a strong leader that cares about his own country and his people.  He should certainly not care to listen to what Trudeau says.
"The pro Hamas people labelled Pierre or Skippy as Trudeau supporters call him, as being pro Israel while Israel implied Trudeau is anti Israel"
"i wonder when/if people will ever have a honest conversation about this.  palestians are harboring and supporting hamas.  shit, they even let them live under their schools and hospitals to shield them - providing them electricity, food, water etc.

the palestians were like a bunch of drunk football fans cheering on hamas with glee on oct 7th.  these are not people scared for their lives.... shit, in mississauga we had people driving around honking horns and waving hamas and isis flags.... some 'refugee' female put on her best ak-47 earings at a protest.  you can not make this shit up.

trudeau is so incredibly long gone from reality.  i remember when people said that taking a chance on him was better than the alternative.... hahahahahahahaha.  what a joke of a country we have become.  a punchline."

">I'm certainly no fan of Trudeau

This line is now a running meme in here, right?"
He should go the next step and state that Palestinians deserve basic human rights. That would REALLY piss off Israel.
">  I can get on board with calling for the protection of civilian lives. If such calls piss off Bibi, I think that says more about Bibi than it does about Trudeau.

Here I fixed your post for you."
The implication is that Israel isn't using maximum restraint. Israel is going above and beyond to keep civilians out of harms way. They literally announce sometimes with days of warning to tell people to evacuate an area that has military infrastructure. Hamas is literally building bunkers below hospitals and using ambulances as taxi services for their military in hopes Israel attacks so they can claim war crimes.
Well said
"Unless it's the radical right wing subs, then anything anyone has to say that is a guy against Trudeau, they will really and join in the cries ""how dare Trudeau embarrass pour country Inn offending another country's biased opinion"""

"If the same had to happened to Canada, I’m pretty darn sure we would ask our military to do the exact same thing… 

Actually, we kinda did when we took care of ISIS in Iraq."
They're leveling the city?
That number was provided by Hamas.
Imagine someone wanting to chill after a thousand of your innocent citizens were murdered.
"Of course we can live with it, but the problem is that Israel already uses maximum restraint. They gave people three weeks to evacuate northern Gaza. They gave them roof knocks, leaflet drops, SMS messages, broadcast their intentions to the world and set up humanitarian corridors. Hamas literally stopped Gazans at gunpoint from evacuating, dropped car bombs, and murdered civilians who wanted to escape.

What else would Trudeau have Israel do?"
Introspection's not a valued trait in that community..
"They have,  and they look at their opposition with the same disdain they look upon Gazans. If they could manufacture a justification for jailing the equal rights crowd in Israel,  they would do it with glee."
"What innocent civilians?  When a Russian captive escaped from Hamas, Gazan civilians re-captured them and handed them back over to Hamas."
None of the rest of us are fully real humans the way we define it to either fundamentalist Jews or to the vast majority of Islamic leadership in that part of the world and here often too (the weaselly Sharia wording for this stuff is quite enlightening).
Which is super weird considering that Palestinians are also a Semitic people
"What did he say that was so egregious in that clip? I didn't bother watching the second one, but the first one had nothing particularly bad except maybe ""What's wrong with Jews and Arabs living side by side?"" which I know the Palestinians object to, but I don't personally take issue with."
"Now do the other way.

No?

Wonder why"
The young turks? Seriously?
"Is there an argument somewhere explaining why this is genocide? That's a big fucking claim, especially given the history of who it's being made about. Yet there's zero actual debate about it, it's just a way to signal you're anti-Israel.

Does anyone have evidence Israel is committing genocide, i.e. ""the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group""?"

They view Palestinians as ""human animals"" ([direct quote from Defense Minister](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/defense-minister-announces-complete-siege-of-gaza-no-power-food-or-fuel/)) so the quote from Trudeau is basically disavowing their framing of the issue. They view that as taking a side."
">The 800,000 Israelis who gathered to protest against his policies earlier this year agree with me.

They were protesting his plans for judicial reform, not anything to do with war or Gaza policy."
They have Napoleon syndrome.
RIP to Saleh al Qaraan. 🙏
Lol way too late
Great. Then no need to be offended.
They were bombing Gaza literally the same day as October 7th. What three weeks are you talking about. The death toll in the first week was already in the thousands.
"I love when people say how wonderful Israel is with its “roof knocks”. I can’t imagine the mental gymnastics it takes to praise a country for giving you a warning before creating 2 million homeless refugees and destroying homes, hospitals and infrastructure. But yeah. It’s nice they had an hour warning. 

Fucking disgraceful."
"wow 3 weeks for 1m+ people to move south that is also getting bombed? Stop commenting already lol. Is it ok to bomb a crowed of 30 people including kids and babies if there is 1 (maybe, not even 100% sure) hamas member in that crowed?"
Do you know what maximum means?
"If Canada started bombing civilians in response, I like to think Canadians would stand up and put an end to it. Those who didn't, or who were offended by calls to show restraint, would be just as wrong as Israel is."
"If Israel does not deal with this the people around them are going to kill all of them. And we have enough people here interested in doing it too. All those QAnon types are those types of people.

I get it. And so does everyone else."
"It was in poor taste when right after the terrorism people were waving Palestinian flags or pretend like the disgusting, inhuman crimes by Hamas were at all excused or justified. Every member of Hamas needs to be caught or exterminated. Anyone who justifies their actions (especially the clowns who utter ""colonization"" with every other breath) needs to be shamed into caves.

However with time of course every could and *should* talk about what is right. Israel is not immune to criticism or commentary, *especially* when we in the West are entirely complicit in the activity.

I mean...by now everyone realizes that Israel is attempting to make the Northern half of Gaza a no-go zone, right? The complete and utter destruction of everything is not fighting terrorists, it is purposeful destruction and will be justified as some buffer, which is completely untenable.

A two state solution is needed more than ever. The creepy far right Israelis who are trying to settle in identified Palestinian lands (e.g. the West bank) need to be forcefully evicted, whether by Israel joining the civilized world or an international force. Palestinians need to stop being stone age theocratic peoples who think some magical sky fairy justifes absolutely inhumane, grosteque civil behaviors."

"We kind of didn't do that. We sent 600 ground personnel(to four different countries. Not only iraq), 69 special forces advisors, and launched some airstrikes. There's an estimated(and debated) dozen or so civilian deaths caused by Canadian airstrikes. 

We got there in 2014 and, by 2016, launched a total of 251 airstrikes. We were mainly training Iraqi forces and only got in a handful of fire fights. Only one Canadian was killed, and it was friendly fire.

""Canada's role is primarily advisory, as Canadian special forces troops were sent to observe the progress of Iraqi forces.""

Our participation in Iraq is hardly comparable, and there was no reason for us to be there, we were just doing what we always do, and that's tagging along while others go and fight their wars."

"Do you even have a slight clue about this conflict or are you simply posting nonsense? Do you understand that Gaza has been under an illegal blockade for 17 years in which Gazans are not allowed to leave? Not allowed to have an airport, a sea port, not allowed building material, not allowed some medical permits. Israel left Gaza in 2005 but they still occupy and control every aspect of what goes in and what goes out of Gaza. Ask yourself this, if you had no hope for the future, no job prosperities, no nothing what would you do in the same position as them?

"Fun Fact Time!  ( Well not so fun )

During WW2, while bombing numerous cities to oblivion and 2 nuclear explosions over cities the [military-to-civilian death ratio was 1.5 : 3.8](https://dcas.dmdc.osd.mil/dcas/app/conflictCasualties/ww2).  Thats with dumb bombs and incendiary bombs.

Now we are still under the fog of war when it comes to what is happening in the Gaza strip, but, [over](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/israel-hamas-war-death-toll-1.7032004) and [over](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/12/world/middleeast/israel-death-toll-hamas-attack.html) and [over](https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties) again we can see that civilian casualties are incredibly high.   Final numbers will have to wait till it's over.  That's with smart bombs, GPS guided missiles, Drones Scouting, satellite pictures, and more!  We are talking about a tech level where they can fire a missile from the far side of the country and be accurate to 2m 99.9% of the time

The IDF is orders of magnitude more capable of mitigating civilian deaths than a military from WW2, one that completely leveled dozens of cities full of civilians on purpose.  So why, when they are more capable than ever, is the ratio SO bad?

"I'll try not to make this sound personal - but it irks me when people with little information on Israeli politics speak with authority about Israeli politics.

The judicial reform was a move to dismantle democratic principles and due process of law in favour of more authoritarian-style and theocratic governance. The Israeli people know that Netanyahu's government maintains its power through a coalition between right-wing and religious extremist groups in Israel, which are the groups pushing theocratic laws and inflammatory anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian policies like supporting settlers in the West Bank.

The fight for equality for secular (non-religious) Jews and Arabs were at the core of many of the protests, e.g:

>On 10 June, around 80,000 protesters participated in the main demonstration in Tel Aviv. They were joined by thousands of others in around 150 locations around the country. Many of the events started with a moment of silence in memory of the victims of a wave of killings in the Arab Israeli community.

(from https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Israeli_judicial_reform_protests).

As someone who cares deeply about Israeli politics and keeps track of it outside of North American headlines, I can tell you that the protests were, broadly, a fight against the Israeli right-wing's proclivity for war and religion-based policy.

I know many protesters who were involved and the groups they belong to. It was a coalition of left-wing and centrist groups, some quite generalized and some special-interest (like pro-LGBT and pro-interfaith marriage), but there was an extremely strong anti-war and anti-settler current throughout, as evidenced by the advocacy against anti-Arab violence.

Israeli politics are more complex than most people realize. Israeli Millennials and Gen Z in particular are *very* anti-settler and pro-Arab Israeli. They're just not pro-Hamas or pro-Fatah, but they largely want to make moves to deescalate like prosecuting West Bank settlers for the violent crimes that the right wing turns a blind eye to.

These are the Israelis we need to support as Canadians, because they're the internal advocates for peace and Western democratic values. It's one thing to denounce Netanyahu. The even more constructive thing is to support the Israelis who are demanding and offering alternatives."
"So if you agree Israel did everything it could to prevent civilian casualties, despite Hamas trying to keep them from leaving, you wouldn't be offended if an ass clown like Trudeau virtue signaled with no clue or suggestion as to how it could have been differently?"
"Not only was it same day, Israel’s air strikes started only 4 hours after the Oct 7 attack even started (6:30am vs 10:30am). At that point Israel didn’t even know the full extent of the attack or that there were hostages."
"The three weeks was before the major military operation that was carried out in the north of Gaza that led to the vast, vast, majority of casualties."
"If Hamas didn't hide installations in those places, there would be no need to do so. Would you prefer that they not warn civilians and let them get killed? Hamas sure would."
Name a war that didn't displace people.

To simply dismiss wholesale the idea of being offended is ridiculous and disingenuous. The above quote and those defending it are being deliberately obtuse."

Like it or not, it's self imposed. There's no version of events where Israel allows construction material to flow as long as they're getting shelled regularly. And every other country, for that matter."
"Do you have the slightest clue that Gaza was under no blockade before their very own people elected a jihadist terrorist organization to power and let it execute and expel the moderate government that they had prior?

Do you understand that Hamas has been importing weapons, misappropriating building materials to build terror infrastructure like tunnels, rocket launch pads and bombs under the very civilians you assume they protect?

Are you aware that even Egypt had to close its border to keep these lunatics contained from spreading further hate and radicalism in their own country?

Has it ever even once crossed your mind that had Palestinians reneged on their fundaments calls for violence and searched ways to make peace, this conflict would have been over long ago and their future would have been long secured?

Have you ever had the tiniest brain cell to ask yourself what happened to those Palestinians who did? They became known as Israeli Arabs, serve in the very same army and got attacked and executed by the same people you are so vehement trying to protect.

And the evacuation corridors
"Welcome to war, civilians casualties are a result.
They are not targeting civilians specifically, but when terrorists set up shop in civilian locations and fire rockets what do you want them to do? At least then try to door knock before bombing.
In a perfect world a two state peace solution would exist. Is there a way to remove hamas without collateral damage? Does Israel just not do anything?"
"That number was provided by Hamas, you’re spreading terrorist disinformation."
"> The IDF is orders of magnitude more capable of mitigating civilian deaths than a military from WW2, one that completely leveled dozens of cities full of civilians on purpose. So why, when they are more capable than ever, is the ratio SO bad?

Because Gaza can't evacuate, and most of the people on the frontline of WW2 were soldiers, since everyone left by the end of the first war.

Hamas has deeply embedded itself within Gazan civilian infrastructure, and wears plain clothes rather than a clear uniform.

This means that this particular war expects a heavy amount of civilian casualties, moreso than most, due to its nature. However, with that said, 3-5k dead Hamas members, the lowest and highest estimates reported, are still quite good."
">So why, when they are more capable than ever, is the ratio SO bad?

Combination of Hamas not reporting military deaths and Hamas using human shield both increasing the civilian number along with a lack of direct military on military engagements to increase the number on the military side of the equation."

Somewhere between carpet bombing and nuking all of Gaza after cutting off all water, food and electricity into the strip.

Thankfully Israel is the one with that capability and not Hamas, so we haven't had to see that happen."
"Yes.  Between Gazans returning escapees to Hamas, and, as per the Qatari government, 40 of the prisoners captured on 10/7 being held captive by Gazan ""innocent civilians"" and Hamas passing around captives to other terrorist groups like they were Pokémon cards, there are no innocent actors to be found in Gaza. 

Everyone has to be treated as an enemy combatant, making everywhere with a Gazan a legitimate, and justifiable, military target."
"My understanding is you can find deranged quotes throughout the years and recently; there's the far-right religious nutjobs in Israel, and just ""fuck it, blow them all up"" rhetoric you can hear out of fed-up people or assholes.

But a nation's ""intent"" can't be determined by cherry-picking the worst quotes. Instead, look at their actions: They consistently take steps to minimize civilian casualties and attack military targets. Eg, the al-Shifa hospital used as a Hamas military HQ had 50k residents on Oct 7, they gave a month to evacuate it down to 3k, and took the hospital with probably a few dozen deaths at most (from wikipedia). 

Their acceptance of collateral damage absolutely can be criticized, I fucking hate kids being killed as much as anyone, I promise that. But to just ignore how fucked the human shield use makes this whole conflict is dishonest. And this is arguably the most scrutinized army of all time, with half the world ready to blast every IDF overreach to the ears of billions as more proof of how evil they are...  


Idk, I just think the way people distort this conflict is absurd, and redefining genocide to be used against Israel is particularly perverse."
"Calling it ethnic cleansing to allow the north to evacuate while they hunt down Hamas is pretty silly imo, they're getting defamed for doing the responsible thing, can't win.

Saying that their ultimate goal is to find someone to take the Palestinians as refugees, is more reasonable. That surely counts as ethnic cleansing, and there was a leaked document from some (powerless) Israeli defense ministry outlining a plan for this.

I don't support that, I get that's beyond the pale of it was pushed by Israel. But goddamn, I've ready some pretty convincing articles on why emigration is actually the best thing for Palestinian civilians. You've got a population run by terrorists, with ambiguous but real support of the populace for its suicidal lost cause, it's just such a fucked situation. Any Palestinian who can get out should, and we should NOT let Arabic and Western countries off the hook for not accepting Palestinians refugees under the guise of preventing ethnic cleansing."
"They do it slowly and by stealth because they don’t have the courage to do it openly as they clearly want to. The world’s eyes are upon them and Israel cannot survive without the charity of the US and Europe, so their atrocities and genocide are covert and slow so as not to upset their benefactors."

You are telling me every family's home, every shop, school, church, mosque, and street in large parts of Gaza city had terrorists operating in them? Surely you have to see through the farce and how this narrative of human shields is applied retrospectively to absolve them of destruction and civilian death

The widely accepted death count is 16k civilians, over 5000 of them kids dead, the one story I found with the number of dead Hamas operatives was like 60. This is a horrendous ratio"

"I like the 9/11 comparison because we should absolutely not look at what the US did in Afghanistan and the rest of the middle east as a model for how to react to an attack. Also, they reacted before they even had their own facts sorted. They recently changed their death toll from 1400 to close to 1200. Now we are even seeing reports of friendly fire in Haaretz. Bibi was close to getting kicked out and jumped at the opportunity this situation provided and played with the emotions of the Israelis.

Now let's get back to your argument. Hamas won a free and open election that was sponsored and supervised by Jimmy Carter who he calls the occupied territory as an apartheid state which has been the case since 1967. Maybe math is not your forte but that is 56 years of a brutal military occupation in which btw had no hamas until 1988. Yes hamas builds tunnels and guess who else built tunnels to protect themselves? Jews in the Warsaw ghetto who were called terrorists by the Nazis.Egypt doesn't control the Rafha crossing Israel does but you are simply misinformed. 

""Has it ever even once crossed your mind that had Palestinians reneged on their fundaments calls for violence and searched ways to make peace, this conflict would have been over long ago and their future would have been long secured?""

Ah yes call for peace when every year thousands of Palestinians homes are demolished for new settlers in the West Bank, olive trees destroyed year after year, children being sent to prison without trial. Did you know that the first intifadah started non violently? Guess what that achieved? Nothing they got killed, beaten and brutalized.

This is so callous it's ridiculous. You can't defeat Hamas by murdering scores of civilians genius.
"Except they are targeting civilians. Hospitals are supposed to be off limits. But hospitals and schools are targets. They had a list of all journalists homes and bombed them also along with their families. Those were not Hamas. It makes no sense to ever bomb a hospital when you could just control those entering and existing easily enough. On top of the fact that all the water plants in Gaza were destroyed before 2006 and not allowed to be rebuilt so the Netanyahu government is denying everyone the necessary water to live.

(Hashtag) Not in our name"
"To be clear, because Hamas is a terrorist organization, automatically anything they say is a lie? Or only if it makes Israel look bad?

If Hamas is trustworthy enough to negotiate a hostage exchange with, then you can’t conclude that they are lying just because they are talking.

Refusing to believe anything Hamas says is just a cowards cover allowing you to justify Israel’s murdering of civilians."

Hamas will have to hide over half their casualties to even reach parity with WW2 numbers.  So sounds kinda sus to me.

The fact is, the IDF should have a BETTER ratio to WW2 if they really are showing ""maximum restraint"".  With the tech they have I have a hard time seeing anything but intentional targeting if Palestinians.

Keep in mind we are talking about WW2.  A time when armies were killing civilians on purpose.  Literally going out of their way to kill people because fuck you that's why.  Yet the IDF is killing even more..."

>The vehicle is travelling north on Salah al-Din road

And if you were an informed person, you'd realize that was the safe evacuation corridor.

Also, if you could read you may have clicked the link I conveniently provided to the source of the claim, which has a comment from the IDF

>“**The IDF distinguishes between combatants and civilians, and uses lethal force only against combatants or a person posing an immediate threat,”** said the IDF Press Office, in a statement to Bellingcat. **“The IDF does not operate under the assumption that anyone who approaches is a combatant and have clear orders to verify, by all means available in the field, that a potential threat or combatant is not a civilian prior to opening fire.”**

So

>Who was in that car?? 

The IDF **didn't bother to attempt to identify** who would be in the vehicle **in the safe evacuation route**.

Try reading next time before you post your JAQing off BS."
Call for more fucking restraint. Israel is not using all their restraint.
"A ceasefire is always a solid idea. Y'know, stop killing women and kids for a beat?"
Show restraint? Stop killing civilians?
Don’t know if you’re doing such a good job winning people over here bud.
"I'm not going to be so crass as to compare your comment to a nazi, but I do have to wonder if there were denialists in the US defending Germany during the 40's. ""Surely those stories aren't true, the German army took over all of France in a few days, if they wanted to I'm sure they could..."""
You're weird bro.
"I mean if Israel did a complete genocide like you seem to want, they would lose all support from the western world and I doubt they would do great economically if they get the Russia treatment."
Maximum restraint would mean using special forces to take out Hamas instead of bombing any civilian building with a Hamas member inside.
You do write stories…
">Thankfully Israel is the one with that capability

Why is that thankful?"

">there's the far-right religious nutjobs in Israel

You mean Nethanyahu's cabinet ministers?

Is it cherry-picking when the quotes are from Nethanyahu and his cabinet? 

From this article alone: [https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-war-rhetoric.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-war-rhetoric.html) 

* “You must remember what Amalek has done to you, says our Holy Bible — we do remember,” said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, referring to the ancient enemy of the Israelites, in scripture interpreted by scholars as a call to exterminate their “men and women, children and infants.”
* “We are fighting human animals, and we are acting accordingly,” said Yoav Gallant, the defense minister
* The agriculture minister is saying ""We are now rolling out the Gaza nakba,” “Gaza nakba 2023.”
* The heritage minister called for nuking Gaza, saying everyone there is a combattant
* National Security Minister is Itamar Ben Gvir, openly wants to erase Palestine

The leadership of the country is literally saying ""we are doing this"" and you're like ""nooooo! it's not happening you're cherry picking quotes""."
You gotta be kidding me.  Are you really that naive?
They write stories name checks out.
"Thousands of Israelis dead and being held hostage, raped, and tortured and promises from Hamas that there will be an October 7, October 8, and October Infinity.

Should Israel just let October Infinity keep happening or does it have a responsibility to defend itself?"
Is it OK for military to hide among kids and babies putting their lives at risk?
If that crowd is surrounding a missile site that is firing rockets with the intent of massacring Israelis it absolutely is right to destroy it.
"Okay, maybe its my ignorance but I always believed It was a religion, Judaism, practiced by Jewish people. I mean I guess I was raised Catholic but because I don’t believe in Catholicism, I don’t say I am Catholic. Do non-practicing Jews still consider themselves Jews?"
">Your missing the point though, how do you define what should and shouldn't be offensive? By debating it with examples and reason, justifying the outrage.

Being offended is a reaction to an *offense*. A tangible action or behaviour that causes some form of harm. Just because you don't think a particular action is offensive, doesn't mean it isn't. It depends entirely on context (who you're around, where you are, etc.) what is offensive and what is not.

>Simply being offended doesn't give you the right to determine what abusive behaviours are.

This is you turning the argument around to suit your preferred position, which appears to be that being offended by something is an arbitrary occurrence that exists in a vacuum. This is completely false. Again, being offended is a *reaction* to an *offense*.

The thing to be debated is whether something is an offense or not, *not* whether someone should be offended or not. And an offense is a quantifiable event that can be decided by consensus, and this is something that can and does change over time. Whether the offense is real or impacting determines the justification of being offended.

You are most definitely being obtuse, and I can't explain this in any clearer terms. I'll thus end things here."
Israel and Egypt. Neither wanted an open border.
"Literally, every ten years since the inception of Israel:

1947 United Nations Partition Plan - Two state solution proposed. The UN General Assembly endorsed the proposal, which Jewish leaders accepted, but the Arabs rejected. After Israel declared independence on May 14, 1948, five Arab armies invaded the nascent state to eliminate it. Israel successfully repelled the invasions and eventually signed armistice agreements with Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt.

Oslo Accords (1993 and 1995) - transitional agreements signed by Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) that were designed to establish a partnership for negotiating border disputes, create Palestinian self-governance through the creation of the Palestinian Authority, and over time, pave the path to peace. The Palestinian terror group Hamas, which  opposed Oslo and supported the destruction of the Jewish state, rejected the agreements.

Camp David Summit (2000) - Israel offered significant territorial concessions to the Palestinians, including the establishment of a Palestinian state in most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip with East Jerusalem as its capital. The talks failed to produce a final agreement with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat rejecting the offer.

Annapolis Conference (2007): Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, with the support of the U.S., launched the Annapolis Conference. The goal was to reach a peace agreement that would lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Hamas called for all parties to boycott the conference.

Peace to Prosperity Plan (2020): The plan presented a vision for a two-state solution but with certain parameters, including Israeli sovereignty over some settlements in the West Bank and land swaps. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas had boycotted the Trump administration following its decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017 and therefore rejected the plan.

The Arabs currently in the territory called Palestine don't want a country, they want the destruction of the Jewish people."
"Yes actually they control power and water to Gaza. They've been controlling water supply for Gaza since 1967. That was 56 years ago.

https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/11/the-occupation-of-water/"
"When you occupy a place, destroy the water desalinisation plants and then prevent them from importing concrete to fix the plant, saying you will provide them water instead, then yes Israel is responsible for providing that water."
"Such bad faith comments only serve to turn public support away from Israel. Yall told us to learn the context. We did. Israel is doing a lot of warcrimes, including using siege warfare against civilian targets for a time.

If you want people to support Israel then you should condemn the modern Israeli government and their current actions -- the Israeli people deserve better than Netanyahu, as it is CLEAR that he has single-handedly wiped out decades of international support from major powers."
Thanks. Hated having to scroll so far to see some debunking of this Israeli propaganda.

👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 call out their bullshit! Love to see it
"I don’t get your point in trying to refer back to some of Israel’s old and now defunct organizations like the Irgun. 

The Irgun was one of several Jewish defence forces set up to counter what was then Arab aggression towards Jews during the mass exodus of Jews from Europe after WWII.

The Irgun used methods that the state of Israel today condemns, including acts of terror. 

It’s why it was disbanded when the state of Israel was formed and a code of conduct and moral values was instored.

Perhaps you are trying to compare Hamas’ struggle of violence to that of Israel’s violent beginnings. That’s fair, with the main difference that Israel realized a long time ago that acts of terror were not the path forwards towards achieving peace.

The massacres you mentioned were each in response to similar [Arab massacres towards Jews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killings_and_massacres_during_the_1948_Palestine_war) around the same period. 

Although Israel shift to the right and expansion of settlements in the West Bank is not helpful to achieve long lasting peace with Palestinians in the West Bank, keep in mind Israel unilaterally withdrew all these settlements from Gaza way back in 2005. 

Gaza was not occupied since, nor was it blockaded prior to the election of the Hamas terror group to lead the strip. 

Israel’s actions today are a direct consequence of Palestinian neglect in the countless offers Israel made to achieve peace with them, including deals that offered major land swaps and autonomy like the Oslo accords or the peace initiative under Olmert. 

The rise of the settlements can be attributed to a general sense in Israel that there is no more partner left for peace among Palestinians. 
Far right parties get elected as a result.

This doesn’t change the fact that violence will always breed more violence until one side completely vanquishes the other in an “us or them” mentality. 

All that is left is a status quo of tit for tat attacks.
Hamas’ attack on what is mostly secular and politically left leaning regions of Israel and its society will now guarantee an even greater turn to the right and the extinction of any chance for Palestinians to have a state to call their own. 

Israel will use as much force as necessary to ensure its security and subdue the acts of terror (or indiscriminate resistance if you prefer that term) that  they face."

I’ll die on it with you. Is the answer to stop bombing and allow hamas to fire rockets and kill Israeli children?
Worked with the Nazis and the Japanese.
"Terrorists don’t follow military and wartime laws.
Hamas uses the civilian deaths to their advantage to recruit.
Both sides are fucked."
It’s not murder if they’re in or near legitimate military targets
">Hamas will have to hide over half their casualties to even reach parity with WW2 numbers. So sounds kinda sus to me

They hid [two thirds of them in the 2008-9 conflict](https://www.google.com/amp/s/time.com/3035937/gaza-israel-hamas-palestinian-casualties/%3famp=true), so I'm not sure why you'd suggest hiding a smaller proportion now is ""sus"".

These expectations don't come out of nowhere. It's widely suspected they're significantly under-reporting combatant casualties because they've done exactly that in the past."
"> the emphasis is on damage and not on accuracy

Damage does not equal casualties."
"Here's a video of a Red Crescent medic wearing identification, taking a gun from a wounded man, not helping him, and handing it to a militant to shoot at Israelis. https://old.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/17rg1tj/red_crescent_red_cross_palestinian_medic_taking/"
There was a ceasefire on October 6.
"A ceasefire would be great. It can start as soon as Hamas surrenders unconditionally, and not a minute sooner."
Or Journalists.
"Are you just gonna ignore everything he said. 

Israel already is showing restraint. They tried to get civilians out and Hamas resisted it.

Civilians die in war that’s why we normally avoid it but we don’t usually sneak across borders to kill civilians in order to get ourselves invaded like Hamas"
That guy's fucking delusional.

Because civilians being carpet bombed and nuked would be bad? Which is what Hamas would do about 5 seconds after being given that ability.
"I still value Gazan lives more than Hamas does, funny that."
"Are any of you capable of typing more than 2 sentence replies? What am I being naive about, what do you disagree with? This is important, someone should put some effort in!"
I'm still dubious about Hamas making it over the most watched boarder walls without raising any alarm in an area of the world that has the highest concentration of intelligence assets.
"Where do you draw the line of too much collatoral damage?

Do you even draw one?"
Probably would've been more effective if they sent in ground forces to pinpoint target Hamas instead of creating thousands more terrorists by slaughtering so many children. I find it astounding to believe anyone is actually naive enough to believe the goal was to stop terrorism against Israel considering their actions... I mean this is like America post 9/11 stupidity except even more barbaric and misguided.
you didn't answer my question. Yes or no.
"It's wrong for Hamas to hide among kids and babies.
It's wrong for Israel, knowing Hamas is hiding among civilians, to launch missiles at them."
"except that Israel bombed literally streets, forget firing rockets lol. Populated public spaces. There are no rockets coming from there. Do you people even look at the disturbing footage coming from gaza before dropping the same old human shield argument? There was literally a dead horse in one, people were using it as transport. They do indiscriminate bombing. Look at amnesty international's reports. Bunch of european countries are also pissed off now including spain."

Sorry meant to be praise for linking the sources.
Would they use the same tactic if Hamas was hiding out inside Israel? Why not? There’s your answer
"Be it traffic infrastructure or war operations, most people are not qualified to devise or even understand the right strategy. But most any human everywhere has it in them to see something completely fucked up, almost beyond belief, and say that it is wrong. Traffic light timing or bombing innocent civilians. Not everyone knows the fix but almost everyone can spot the problem. 

No, I do not have the proper strategy for Israel up my sleeve but I can say with full confidence in every way possible that this is wrong. Any politician that’s offended by being told to kill fewer children absolutely needs to fuck off."
"Fascist war machines are totally comparable to what is essentially an insurgency. Didn't work against the viet Kong, Didn't work against the taliban."
I agree the IDF are terrorists and they have 0 respect for international law
The IDF gives Hamas what they want. The IDF have also been bombing UN staff killing hundreds.
"Under that argument, and with most adult Israelis having military training, it can be argued that Hamas didn’t commit murder on Oct 7 as they attacked, from their perspective, legitimate military targets.

Obviously that is bullshit and Hamas committed murder. But if Israel gets to use that logic to justify and legitimize their murders, so does Hamas."
Pathetic
"Next time maybe refer to the [actual report](https://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/a-hrc-12-48.pdf) instead of a media opinion piece.  

If you actually read what you linked and the report itself, it's only stated that Hamas was one of the sources, they included Israel, Human Rights Watch, and the UN ground experts as well.  While I'm at it, may I refer you to pages 149-191, where it is noted that Israel has deliberately attacked civilians before.  Take a second and refer to pages 218-229 too where they also used Palestinians as human shields.

Israel has a long history of NOT showing any regard to civilians even though they are 100% capable of doing so.  At what point will people start taking them at their words and actions, rather than their PR people, that they want all the Palestinians gone."
"> Damage does not equal casualties. 

That's what you're going with?

Your argument was that Israel is using maximum restraint, is that still your opinion after watching them murder that guy in the safe corridor and after reading the quote from the IDF saying they're focusing on damage?

You can admit you're wrong, no ones forcing you to defend murder."
"5000+ children would say otherwise, but the IDF killed them…"
Imaging linking to the Israel subreddit unironically….
Great! That doesn't prevent Trudeau from asking for another one.
"Well, there's already a ceasefire in place. Israel is getting its hostages back. 

I was not expecting Israel to have an absolute shitload of Palestinian kids imprisoned to be able to trade. 

So it was about hostages. But now it's wanting an unconditional surrender by Hamas. While continuing to inflict collective punishment on all Palestinians. 

How many more Palestinians does Israel already have locked up?"
">Israel already is showing restraint. They tried to get civilians out and Hamas resisted it.

They tried to get civilians out? No, they told them which direction to evacuate towards and then bombed them en route. 

>Civilians die in war 

Kids. It's mostly kids being killed. Why? Because the average age there is something like 18. That's the collateral damage you're ok with in trying to eradicate Hamas. 

How many Hamas fighters are in Gaza? It's a genuine question, I have no idea the answer. Is it 10,000? 100,000? 100? Don't you think that's kind of an important one though?"
"Yeah, I'm going to ignore everything he said."
But it isn't bad when Israel does it?
Do you? You said they're all justifiable targets.
"Dude, you made it clear that you support apartheid and crimes against humanity committed by Israel.  
You need to understand that Palestinians are human beings too."
Also it takes a 3 hour drive from the northern tip of Israel to Gaza yet their response time for reinforcements from closer bases than that was 6 hours? And now we're seeing reports of friendly fire. People are talking about not being able to trust the casualty numbers from the Gaza health ministry which all major aid orgs as well as the UN has deemed credible in past conflicts yet Israel officials changing their stories on the fly are somehow believable lol
Tin foil hat might be a little too tight in that case.
"Don’t forget that Egypt warned Israel 3 days before the attack. But according to Netanyahu, that is “totally fake news”."
I draw the line when a military is not acting in a humane and reasonable way.
"If military are using people as human shields, if you've made every effort to notify people to leave the area and given them weeks of notice, roof knocks, SMS messages, and broadcast to the world that you will be operating there and they still don't leave, it's extremely unfortunate, but it's the reality of war.

Now you answer my question. Is it OK for military to hide among children and use them as human shields?"
So what should Israel do? Let Hamas continue? That's bad for Israelis and bad for Palestinians.
It's fire back or be hit by rockets. They need to defend themselves.
"“Oh my god there is a Hamas hiding in Jerusalem! Time to level the whole city!”

It’s such a stupid justification."
"Hamas is the government in Gaza.  

Look at a map and compare Gaza to Vietnam or Afghanistan.  The terrorist scum is running out of places to hide."
Maybe the most in shouldn’t be collaborating with terrorists.
"So the children they murdered were soldiers?

Israel is using precision munitions to minimize innocent casualties, Hamas fires unguided rockets at Israel indiscriminately. 

The two sides aren’t comparable."
" Nobody has been murdered. There have been casualties of war. If Israel wasn't using maximum restraint, Gaza would be glass right now and nobody would be alive. Instead they've dropped thousands of bombs and in comparison killed very few people. That's because they warn people to get out before they strike. Did the US warn the Japanese before they bombed them? Did they warn the Germans?"
Imagine discounting video evidence because of the subreddit it's in.
He won't.
What should be the consequence of Hamas violating this next ceasefire with another October 7th in your view?
"Hamas used car bombs on the convoys lmao 

Hamas has indoctrinated the youth of gaza so we really have no ideas how many members Hamas might have."
I don't know what news you've been watching but Israel isn't carpet bombing and no one has been nuked since 1945...
"Exactly.  Unlike Hamas, I don't view their lives as mere political commodity to score points with naive fools in the West."
"*We* see the Palestinians as human beings. The fanatics running Gaza do not. Even in the ""15,000 civilians"" figure Westerners cite, the original sources use the Arabic term for ""15,000 martyrs"", justified sacrifices in their hopeless crusade to destroy Israel, watching over us from paradise.

Here's a Moroccan ex-Muslim's take on the conflict, it makes all the concessions to the Arabic perspective on this you could ask for. His bio:  


>Born and raised in Morocco, I was corrupted into abandoning Islam after moving to the United States. I was instead indoctrinated by the economics faculty at George Mason into hating the government. After graduating from a T14 law school (the specific rank is NOT relevant), I compounded my apostasy serving as an abortion rights attorney for the ACLU. The path to Allah's forgiveness was eventually permanently foreclosed when I also chose to DJ gay pride parades.

I like guns, yelling at cops, and bicycles. I dislike hierarchy, authority, and coffee. I also host the podcast The Bailey.


Read it or not, but this is who I think about when I see someone accuse anyone who leans towards Israel on this of not understanding Palestinians are human beings."
"So, no lines. You understand what it means right?

Do you have the courage to say it out loud?"
Hamas is hiding in a hospital? Go in and clear the hospital with their military. Obviously no one is saying let Hamas continue why try to say I am?
Within limits.
It's the government but the area is occupied according to international law. You can't defeat a nationalist group using guerrilla tactics by giving them major propaganda coups and doing the exact opposite of what it would take to deradicalize people.
"Were the children Israel has killed soldiers?

And the two sides aren’t comparable. Israel gets billions of military aid, which is partly what has allowed them to subjugate Palestinians so easily. Whereas Hamas gets what they get.

The difference is that Hamas launches those rockets knowing that even if they aren’t shot down by the iron dome, which is the most likely scenario, they aren’t likely to do much as they are unguided. Whereas Israel fires precision ammunition they know will hit their targets and that those targets will cause significant civilian deaths.

What’s crazy is that there is actually room to compare an organization considered to be terrorists to the legitimate government of a country."
"> Nobody has been murdered.

Wow.

Did you see the tank blow up the vehicle in the safe corridor? The IDF is supposed to distinguish combatants, which they clearly didn't, which means they murdered whoever was in that vehicle.

>“The IDF distinguishes between combatants and civilians, and uses lethal force only against combatants or a person posing an immediate threat,” said the IDF Press Office, in a statement to Bellingcat. “The IDF does not operate under the assumption that anyone who approaches is a combatant and have clear orders to verify, by all means available in the field, that a potential threat or combatant is not a civilian prior to opening fire.”

Just admit they aren't using maximum restraint.

And what's with the whatabouts? Is that all you can say? Whatabout something else?"
"So, what you're saying is that Israel should just kill everyone in Gaza.  That way, they get all of Hamas, and since they're at war, apparently it's not murder too!!  

Sounds like you're content indiscriminately killing Palestinians.   Hamas represents Palestininas like the Taliban represents Afghans.  Hamas attacked Israel.  And the Palestinians pay for ut with their lives.  What Hamas did was wrong.  No question.  But to say what Israel is doing is justified because they're at war is ridiculous.  Hamas is a terrorist organization.  Does using the same tactics not make Israel one  too?"
"> If Israel wasn't using maximum restraint, Gaza would be glass right now and nobody would be alive.

So it's either carpet bombing and shooting *casualties* or nuclear annihilation."
"You know you don’t have to defend everything Israel does. Just like any country, they do some pretty messed up shit. No country is perfect, including Canada. 

There is well documented long list of journalists from well reputed international press agencies that Israel has killed and probably will continue to kill…"
What should be the consequences of Israel violating it?
[removed]
What would you describe the air strikes as then?
Yeah you just view their lives as forfeit because they were born in gaza. Let's not ignore how Hamas would never be successful without Netanyahu shutting down the peace process and literally supporting them materially.
That's not what I said.
Yes. Hamas hides in hospitals. Is this news to you?
Sure you can. You think the Japanese weren’t going to fight just as fiercely if we invaded the mainland?  Last I checked they were put in their place.
How should Israel respond when Hamas fires these magical harmless missiles at them?
"I didn't defend ""everything Israel does"". I pointed out that there was a video of a Palestinian medic breaking the law and ignoring a wounded man.

How you got there from here is for you to decide."
"Thats not what I asked but Israel hasn't violated 95% of ceasefires in this conflict.

I'm asking you how Israel should respond to a ceasefire violation. Is it then allowed to destroy Hamas if its promised eternal war?"
Precision bombing on Hamas targets which is also unfortunately hitting the civilians Hamas is using as human shields.
"This guy's a moron, but FYI its not carpet bombing.  Carpet bombing would hit Israel, and cause damage to israeli infrastructure.  Carpet bombing is when you delete a whole city, Israel is hitting blocks at a time."
"The best outcome for the people of Gaza is everyone in Hamas, Islamic Jihad, PFLP to drink a polonium milkshake and die.

Israel is more than happy to pretend Gaza doesn't exist.  Those groups are solely responsible for everything happening in Gaza.

No other nation would accept terrorist groups committed to their destruction, and the extermination of their people, openly operating just across the border.  Yet for some reason so many people have that unrealistic expectation of Israel.  It's hard to argue it's a result of anything other than anti-semitism."
"How is it not? 

You draw the line of how many civilians it's ok to kill at how cruel is a gang of terrorists.

Since there's no line they won't cross. Therefore there's no line you wouldn't either."
No? Did you finish reading after that part?
Lol well you certainly have the talking points down.
They did clear the hospital with their military. Is this news to you? Took babies to Egypt and the whole bit.
"I hardly follow Israel's talking points lol, their settlements in the West Bank are a bastardization of the Oslo accords. I'm just also able to recognize that Hamas are terrorists that have brainwashed the majority of the Palestinian population to hate jews even more than they already did when they elected Hamas (who then threw their political opponents off of buildings...)."
The median age of Palestinians is 18. Hamas was elected in 2006. More than half the current population was nowhere near the voting age and many weren't even born yet.
"I'm aware, sadly extensive polling has shown that both Hamas and the Oct 7th attacks have the popular support of the Palestinian people. Even after Hamas took over, killed their opposition and stopped any future elections (which is why there hasn't been one since 2006)."
"So you agree Hamas is bad, then? And that they are a terrorist organization that is bringing about the downfall of Palestinians and ruining any hope for peace? This is why you're taking the blame away from those younger Palestinians you speak of? Just making sure I'm following."
"It's a little like saying Putin or North Korea have the popular support of their people. 

But definitely the way to win Palestinian hearts and minds is for Israel to keep bombing them and keep moving ""settlers"" into the vacated homes."
"Hamas is bad, the world is finding out that Israel is worse."
"> It's a little like saying Putin or North Korea have the popular support of their people.

I really wish it was (it would give me more hope for a peaceful end to this conflict) but none of the polls I've seen in Gaza really show evidence of coersion or fabrication and certainly not to the levels shown in Russia or North Korea. Fatah routinely polls near or above Hamas depending on the year. Their support goes up and down in response to events in the region as would be expected."
"Hamas is a terrorist organization that needs to be defeated. Israel is working on it. Not easy when they hide in long tunnels, hide munitions in hospitals and schools and use human shields. All we can do is hope Hamas is defeated soon."
"I understand the pro Palestinian stuff. They are treated horribly. If that's what it was, then sure, protest. But some of these gatherings are just people happy that some random Israeli civilians who didn't do anything got murdered. That's so fucked up. In New York, there are people with Swastikas. In Australia, people are shouting, ""Gas the jews.""

It's not just the Palestinian side either. Some hard-core pro Israel people are advocating for everyone in Gaza to be starved and bombed to oblivion. 

This whole situation really shows you everyone's true colors. And it's very sad how long this BS has been going on for."
"For many Palestinians, Hamas is all they've ever known. Last elections were held in 2006. 


There isn't a single Arab nation that wants anything to do with Palestinians. Those young Palestinians are routinely punished for the sins of their fathers and grandfathers.

The PLO and it's supporters were settled in Jordan in 1970. Long story short, they got mad at the King, tried to assassinate him on two separate occasions. Civil war erupted. The Jordanian Army won.

The PLO and it's supporters were expelled to Lebanon. There, the PLO began allying with other pan-Arabist groups and fought another civil war against the Maronite-Christians. The PLO lost. They were then expelled from Lebanon.

Egypt keeps their own border closed because they don't want this sort of thing to happen on their territory, with Hamas.

But all those children and young adults in Gaza had nothing to do with any of this. Sad."
The only thing anyone should be supporting right now is the red cross and moments of silence for innocent victims.
Canada has become a cesspool for these activities!
You cant let every immigrant in from every random country and then be surprised when they act like the country they came from
"My heart feels for the innocent , the injured, those who have even killed, the families and children suffering as a result of these actions, those are my concern."
"These are not “pro-palestine” rallies. These are celebrations of terrorism. To do this during an attack is mind-boggling evil.

Imagine have a pro-Germany rally in 1939. 

Hamas’ stated goal is the killing of every single Jew in the world, including those in Canada."
"If they want to protest, go back to your country and fight for them. Leave your crap out of Canada"
"Dont delude yourself, the timing of these ""rallies/protests"" whatever you want to call them says all you need to know.

They are nothing to do with Palestinian freedom, they are 100% celebrations of the the horrific crimes against humanity committed by Hamas this weekend."
"If you’re going to immigrate to Canada, you must be required to leave your cultural baggage behind"
Fuck do I ever hate religion
Any pro peace rallies?
Losers....run away then protest?
"If you took every weapon Israel had and gave it to the middle east, Israel would be gone in a week. If you took every weapon in the middle east and gave them to Israel, nothing would change."
"If it's hot on the heels of what Hamas did and continues to do to Israel, it is a defacto rally supporting Hamas. If you are really pro-Palestine, you might consider not just protesting Israel, but protesting Hamas, who hides behind civilians in Palestine, as well."

There is nothing good going to come of this. Nobody wins.
"Can I be against both? It helps no one.  If Israel hadn’t just cut off food, medicine and water to the area I would feel different but a fair number of civilians will die because of that.  Hospitals should be exempt from this kind of thing."
"Lets see them all go back and support their Palestine brothers and take their cowardly views back with them. Canada doesn't need this bullshit, we have enough to deal with the incompetent Liberals."
Yeah maybe don’t allow immigration for the sake of increasing your vote bank. Allow immigration to give people a better life as long as they agree to leave most of their cultural baggage behind.
This is disgusting Canada.
"I don't understand how anyone can support either. They've both committed war crimes, crimes against humanity, and human rights violations. Let them kill each other. We'll pick diplomacy up with the survivors. The only people you should be supporting here are the civilian victims, on both sides."
War doesn't decide who's right but it does decide who's left.
"Its a real shame there was pro Hamas rallies where people were cheering on innocent people getting killed, because its clear as day that Israel is gonna start indiscriminately killing thousands of innocent people too, and when people go to protest that, they will be conflated with the earlier Hamas idiots."
"Critical thinking is crucial now more than ever. It is horrifying to see so many Canadians labeling entire populations of people, on either sides, as deserving of violence. This is not the time for polarized thinking that diminishes the complexities and nuances of this 70+ year conflict. 

Stop picking sides like it’s the Super Bowl and call on our government to support a ceasefire and peace talks. Civilians are paying the price for the actions of their corrupt governments (whether that’s Israel’s current alt-right government or Palestine’s Hamas).

Israelis have died. Palestinians have died. The violence will continue for as long as apartheid does - history tells us that much. Resisting occupation is inherit to the human condition all across the world. Our country should be standing for peace and trying to broker a solution."
"Anyone who wants to understand this conflict can listen to this podcast series.

Fear and Loathing in New Jerusalem by Daryl Cooper. It goes from the 1890s to 1947, outlining the origins. Contrary to popular belief, this is not a 1000-year conflict. It's 6 episodes, and the narrative is very compelling."
PSA: It's possible and fair to support Palestine while not supporting Hamas.
"See this is why I love multiculturalism, I get to experience the diverse beauty of a desert conflict right here at home."
"If we can support Ukrainian right to freedom, why can’t we give Palestine that right as well. Of course war criminal on both side should be punished."
"Hmmm support the side that commits the lesser number human rights violations. 

Can't really support either."
Can’t we just relax and let them sort it out amongst themselves?
Mossad chief just said recently that israel is an apartheid regime. Shame on everybody that support apartheid !!!
"At this point after 70 years, world should just intervene and force a resolution on this issue on both parties. Just lock down the whole region until settlement is reached. Enough of terrorist attacks and continuous systematic aggression as well."
"Pro Palestine, anti Israel and Hamas is the only right answer here. I encourage everyone to research this thoroughly I used to be a strong supporter of Israel but that was just my default position until I looked into it. There have been awful things done by both sides but Israel is the primary reason any of these has even happened. That being said it’s incredibly sad hearing about all of the lives ruined and lost I hope there’s an end to this, but it’s gone on for decades at this point."
Imagine of Gaza and West Bank weren't under strict Islamic control. Israel could just let the fentanyl flow in and that would be the end. Like what's happening to our cities.
"Take the easy path and side with the strong, Israel, or take the courageous path and side with the weak, Palestine.   


If you think Israel has the moral high ground because of the recent deaths, wait a week or two, wait until the end. Israel will rank up over ten thousand civilians deaths I bet."
I don’t understand how people can’t see that Hamas and the government of Israel both thirst for the books of the other….
Both sides are terrible.
"No country wants violent Palestinians clearly Arabs don't, importing violent savages doesn't help a country, they bring the same violent rhetoric with them,"
So we just have foreign ideology rallies in Canada now? Is this normal?
"Sorry I know off topic but I had to post share this in an active thread related to Palestine-Israel.

German woman may be alive.

https://x.com/gerashchenko_en/status/1711742288756359375?s=46

If this report is true, and she makes it out alive and well at the end of all this, holy fuck that’s incredible."
People who cant afford housing “where are our rallies?!”
"Did Hamas start in Palestine and now controls their government, Lebanon governments.  That would give them access to the country’s money. 
These countries voting these people in to lead them, control everything from schools to political issues. What can their citizens be like. 
Many are immigrants to North America. That needs to be stopped. These Hamas and their supporters are Terrorists."
"""It's not a question of whether we support the attacks. It's a question of what do we stand against""

emptier words were never spoken."
"In another example of the absurdity of religion, each side will ask everyone else to pray for either the Palestinians or the Israelis. It's a pray-off. No matter to whose benefit those prayers are intended, every prayer that has ever been uttered in the history of humankind has been a total waste of time. There is no god, on allah, no deity of any kind. Think about it. The whole belief that a prayer can be answered and effect an outcome of any kind is total nonsense."
"In addition to 900 civilians, palestinian terrorists murdered 40 babies including beheadings, says the report. Israeli soldiers discovered a horrific scene at Kfar Aza kibbutz near the Gaza border today. - that's who they support here in Canada."
"The Australian rally was somethin else
https://www.reuters.com/world/police-investigate-pro-palestinian-protest-sydney-opera-house-over-alleged-anti-2023-10-10/"
Imagine Russian-Canadians having a rally to celebrate the Bucha Massacre
"Cheering of innocent deaths should never be accepted, hopefully the initial aggressors get justice served. Although time may have already taken some long ago, leaving instability leading to more tragedy"
"Knee jerk reactions are common I guess.  It's especially hard to control in this age where everyone has immediate access to a megaphone and can post their raw emotions before taking even a moment to contemplate.  

Yes Palestine is in a shitty place, but what happened over the weekend was disgusting and anyone out celebrating or even insinuating that Israel ""deserved it"" should be ashamed. Could you imagine if the Israeli army did a sneak attack into Gaza and filmed themselves murdering civilians, raping, and pillaging all to raucous applause?  The entire world would be against them."
Why does any death or conflict need to be celebrated? I’ll never understand this mindset.
">I understand the pro Palestinian stuff.

I don't. No body protesting right now is protesting for free Palestine, they are ALL protesting for the eradication of Israel. 

This war isn't new, if people REALLY were protesting for a free Palestine, they would have been out before. Not just now after Palestine massacred and desecrated hundreds of women and children."
"Pro-Palestinian protests in the wake of the attacks on Israel are pro-Hamas/pro-terrorism. 

They have no place in Canadian and other democracies. They do nothing to endear people to the actual movement and only embolden others to tell them to get the fuck out."
"\> It's not just the Palestinian side either. Some hard-core pro Israel people are advocating for everyone in Gaza to be starved and bombed to oblivion.

Those ""hard-core pro Israel people advocating for everyone in Gaza to be starved and bombed to oblivion"" includes basically the entirety of the Israeli government.

Let's not forget that 6 months ago the Israeli government voted to repeal statutes of the 2005 Gaza withdrawl in a move that many far-right Israeli government ministers celebrated as the first step to the eventual bloody re-conquest of Gaza (bloody being *their* term, not mine). Now suddenly, half a year later, by pure and total coincidence they are **about to do just that**. 

Israel's ultranationalists couldn't have been handed a better final solution to the Palestinian problem if they had planned and orchestrated it (or allowed it to happen) themselves."
"Folks who invest themselves in this shit tend to take a ""my side, right or wrong"" approach to the conflict, since in a lot of ways side here is a political identity rather than a position. In previous decades this wasn't as bad, because you could expect as much right as wrong, give or take. However, the shifting political climates in both Israel and Palestine has meant the balance has shifted towards wrong.

For what it's worth, the conflict is gonna be the end of bibi and a lot of the guys associated with him. While it might not be an end to Hamas, obviously their resources are going to be significantly depleted, and by depleted I mean blown up. There's gonna space for new or old players to get back on the board and shift things in a different direction. It probably won't happen, but's a chance as opposed to the none before."
"I'm glad to see the great and enlightened Canada boldly protect a plucky resistance movement from an evil authoritarian government. As citizens who were never directly involved in the violence they deserve to say whatever they want.   
As a third world savage I was privileged to be educated by Canadians on the value of freedom of speech over the last few months, and I'm so glad to see the depths of their commitment to that noble principle. Everyone should be allowed to scream anti Semitic death threats, just as everyone should be allowed to celebrate an Indian terrorist movement.  
Go Canada!!!!"
"> Some hard-core pro Israel people are advocating for everyone in Gaza to be starved and bombed to oblivion.

Seems to be the consensus on r/canada"
"Finally a top comment wit a modecum of common sense. 

People advocating for the IDF to level gaza as if 2 million people dont live there."
"Thank you good Redditor. Finally a person who has a true balanced view. Palestinians and Israelis HATE each other and the solution starts at complying with UN resolutions for a just and long lasting peace for both sides. Bonus all Arab countries will normalize ties. 

I want to add one thing that you may have missed. It's not the hardcore pro-israel. It's the official Israeli army position to starve Palestinians out and they are currently bombing them to oblivion as we speak.

Ignorant Canadian's will now realize why Modi is right to do what he does in India. It's the same story almost everywhere where the 'peaceful' religion pretends it's the victim whereas it's exactly the opposite.
"The way I see it, these people don't have true colours. They're transparent. Whatever ideologies are shined on them shine right on through."
"I think you need to re-evluate how you see the Israel/Palestine conflict.  People who shout ""Gas the Jews"" are pretty emblematic of the pro-Palestine anti-Zionist side."

"That actually happened 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_Nazi_rally_at_Madison_Square_Garden"
"There were pro-Nazi rallies all over North America in the lead up to WWII because there was at least tepid support for Hitler and a lot of antisemitism. It’s only after the fact that we’ve tried to erase that stain on the country.

But totally agree that this type of ""protesting"" is disgusting and should not be tolerated in Canada nor any other democracy."
"I don’t belong to either faith, I don’t understand how your faith can require you to kill someone of a different faith. I just can’t understand the mindset."
There were pro-nazi rallies in 1939
"You are aware that they can't even leave Gaza, right?

How are they going to get here? Paragliders?"
"You are completely wrong and I'm pretty sure this is intentional fear mongering.  Hamas' stated objectives are territorial and not based on religious ideology.  They have no intention of coming to Canada or killing all the Jews around the world.  Nor is there evidence of mass celebrations of terror here either.

EDIT:  What's interesting here is how outraged people are when Israeli civilians get killed, which is horrible.  But the same people are pro killing Palestinian civilians.  You can be against Hamas (which btw most Palestinians are...I know someone is going to post ""oh did you see such and such video of some rando celebrating! They all need to die!"") and also against Israel's ethnic cleansing policies. This year alone the IDF and settlers have killed at least 1 person every single day that year (1 at minimum but typically more).
However appears most here are perfectly fine with Palestinians being murdered.  Says alot about people and their the underlying racism!"
There are some Palestinians in attendance who are pro Hamas and there were some Israelis in attendance who are pro-Bibi's fascistic actions. Calling either group a monolith is reductive and lacks critical thinking skills. The world is not black and white.
"You're disgusting. Hamas is not Palestine not does it control all palestinian territories. And while they did is atrocious, it's not even a drop in the bucket of what Israel does let alone what the Nazis did. 

You should be ashamed of yourself."
"Sort of used to be that way, these days Liberal Democracies have allowed too much unpleasant baggage in and have no longer any way to control it. Canada is not the Canada of 15 years ago."
It's not religion.  It's much older than that.  It's tribalism.  Humans can other-ize people for all kinds of reasons of which religion is but one.
"If it’s not religion, it’s race. If not race, it’s political ideology. Humans are fucked and there’s no cure for this madness since we’re biologically wired to tribe up and hate the other."
It’s a cancer to humanity.
Assigning people to live in gaza is how this all started. Not sure how that could be the cure…
Unfortunately can't most are university students / student groups
"They have been killing each other for far too long, no sign it's going to end soon.  Arms dealers are happy."
Maybe it's time to audit what is being taught in school. Maybe higher education
">ceasefire and peace talks

How on *earth* do you have ceasefire & peace talks with an organization that has proven it has both the capability and willingness to enter Israeli territory and indiscriminately kill, rape, and torture *anyone* they encounter? Who take hostages to subject them to further violence, humiliation, and death, record these heinous acts and then broadcast & celebrate them for all the world to see? 

There is no coming back from that. You don't hold fire when confronted with that kind of barbarism. You eradicate it, by any means necessary, and you tell anyone who objects to that to go pound sand."
because diplomacy has done so much for Palestine up to this point

"It is, but when the timing of protests coincides with an attack on Israel, it’s not pro-Palestinian, it’s pro-terror."
What if I told you that Palestine supports Hamas?
It's either genocide or continue to have Hamas. It's a pretty fucked up ultimatum.
Actually you are incorrect. No one is coming to save Palestinians but themselves and Hamas is the only group that is actually getting any results. If you don't support Hamas you don't support Palestinians.
So let Israel try to genocide Palestine again?)
"Suppose Israel starts to do nothing, no response to any aggression. What exactly do you think the lovely people of Hamas do next? The answer is they kill every Jew. 

But even suppose all the Jews were to flee at this point - so nothing left to fight. Does Hamas go from indiscriminately raping and killing unarmed civilians, including children, to being peaceful, law-abiding citizens who will make sure all Palestinians are safe? Do you think they just drop all that aggression and hate, and they just stop being murderers and rapists?"

"Facts! Hamas bad/Israel bad. Hamas ≠ Palestine. Israel has committed absolute atrocities against Palestine, but as they are 1000% backed by the United States, western society only ever sees their side of the story. Israel is absolutely the oppressive force in this situation. History is always written by the victors."
"The correct answer is being anti-everbody. There is no good guy or right side in this conflict, so stop trying to look for one. Everyone has been a dick at some point."
">but that was just my default position until I looked into it.

This is basically the natural state for people born in Canada. It's just how our media and politics talk about it. I'm sure the fact that Canada is the second biggest arms dealer to Israel behind the US has nothing to do with it...

Regardless, Canadians tend to have a very dehumanizing perspective on Palestine, and a completely lack of understanding of Israel's crimes, which every human rights watch group in the world is united in condemning. Kinda wild."
The Taliban manage to drag their asses around to do PoS stuff all the time and they are mostly on hard opiates.
Just because one side is weaker doesn't mean they're any better.
Hamas wanted a war and they got one. Israel is launching targeted attacks right now but the truth is it could turn Gaza into a parking lot in less than 1 hour without the need of risking ground troops lives.  I hope it ends with the fewest deaths possible.
Score is irrelevant. Power and wealth is more a sign of ability to cooperate and enfranchise other humans than being oppressive.
"More. We will see plenty of beatings, rapes , torture. Just watch. The ground invasion is coming. They are already bombing ambulances and dropping cluster and phosphorus bombs en masse which is a war crime"
"Canadians have no spine, and these people have no brains so that explains why everything is the way it is"
"The ""initial aggressors"" are debatable."
Neither should staying silent while people are massacred for decades.
"israel has never listened to peaceful protests nor given consessions for the past 50yrs. yes the attack was horrible but its what happens when u push a group of vulnerable ppl too far, and not listen to peace."
"They do that regularly in the West Bank. They arrest 200-300 children a year with no charges. Hell settlers burnt a family on the same day.  No charges or investigation. They do the equivalent raid routinely as part of the occupation. 

Nothing excuses it, but we should be consistent in also condemning Israeli colonial violence, not just Palestinian responses to said violence"
"Hate of ""the other"""
i also don't understand the celebration of death but the US did celebrate death of multiple people so i guess its a weird norm? ill never understand it myself.
Uhh you know there have been bare free Palestine protests BEFORE today right?
People have been protesting for decades…. What the hell are you on about
"They *have* been out before, what are you talking about? These people have been out protesting the crimes and violence done towards Palestine for decades, and that is what most of them are doing now. 

I can't tell if you're an Israeli bot farmer or just really dense. Either way, congratulations. You've now done your part to delegitimize anyone who speaks out against the starvation and annihilation of two million people in the Gaza strip."
"Israel has declared war and is about to royally fuck up Gaza.

How is that not worth protesting?"
"Watch this short documentary to understand the true desperation of The Palestinians:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aEdGcej-6D0"
"Uh, no."
People aren't calling for the eradication of Israel but we are seeing the eradication of Palestinians.
"The reality is if all Hamas members were killed right now, in 6 months some other group would come up and do the exact same thing.

When you cage ppl, starve them, bomb them they will eventually realize they’re going to die anyways and will fight  to the end, leading exactly back to Hamas.

Israel is unwilling to fix the root issue and it will always lead back to dead civilians on both sides"
Or they might be protesting at the many international laws Israel keeps committing against Palestine ? Or the many deaths that are happening on a weekly basis.
"https://casebook.icrc.org/case-study/water-and-armed-conflicts

Blocking water, food and humanitarian aide is a war crime. 

Just in case you’re confused about whether or not you’re cheering for war criminals."
You're wrong
"The people funding Hamas are states that want to see the dismantling of an ultranationalist Jewish state. It helps the causes of both ultranationalists like Netanyahu have more legitimacy in exterminating a people/bulldozing a foreign nation like Palestine, and it stokes the fires in Palestine aligned nations such as Jordan, Iran, etc - which is something those nations want to legitimatize their (likely pending) conflicts against Israel.  


The reality is that Israel will exist in 20 years, Palestine probably won't. Horribleness all around really."
"I don't buy the zero intelligence thing at all, they say they knew nothing but Israeli intelligence has assets within hamas and all inside gaza so for them to claim to have known absolutely nothing really really stinks"
"Funny enough, it’s the the same people always pointing out that the Ukraine war is none of our business."
"And the official Israeli army position too. They cut food and water bombed the Egypt crossing and threatened to bomb any aid that tries to pass through. 

It starts with our no good fucked up fake news. That's where all the ignorance comes from ."
"Exactly the people on this sub Reddit are disgusting, I don’t know how they call themselves Canadians."

The Charter right to freedom of expression does not protect the promotion of hatred, and Hamas is a [formally recognized terrorist group under Canadian law](https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/ntnl-scrt/cntr-trrrsm/lstd-ntts/crrnt-lstd-ntts-en.aspx#25) because of their policy calling for the extermination of Israel.

It makes me nervous too. I don’t think Canada has been nearly judicious enough.
"Unfortunately we are past that now, the amount of hidden hatred in Canada will come to boil at some point. Liberal democracies have opened the doors far to wide and let in some underlying issues. How can any Canadian cheer for the rape and killing of Elderly, Women and Children is beyond my understanding. Take away religion and culture, just the basic horror of killing innocents should never be cheered on."
"That is wild, I hadn't seen this bit of history before."
Varied (in my option misguided) interpretations.
">You are aware that they can't even leave Gaza, right?

No other country wants them.

Every time a country took in a large portion of Palestinians refugees...  they caused the exact same problems there..."
They can go to Egypt lol.
"I didn't say it was logical or that they have the ability. I'm saying that that is their goal.

That being said, judging by how many supporters they have here, there is a good chance that there will be attacks in Canada against Canadian Jews."
"Have you seen the videos of what hamas did?

 all the ""allahu akbar""s as they killed and mutilated civilians, or when they paraded a naked dead girl through the streets."
"Sorry friend, Hamas definitely maintains an religious ideology, was created by a Muslim brotherhood member to counter the secular government at the time in the 80s.   You need to do some research bud."
"to quote a senior hamas official....

Mahmoud al-Zahar: ""The entire planet will be under our law, there will be no more Jews or Christian traitors."""
Not based on religious ideology... Then why do they want to replace Israel by a Islamic state? Why are they doing jihad? Pretty sure they have issued fatwa before also...
Hamas stated objectives. The literal truth!
Palestine is Hamas and vice versa. Plenty of warning has been offered. Anyone who has not fled is Hamas or a Hamas supporter.
"Don't pretend the world didn't just see Palestinians celebrating en masse the murder and rape of hundreds of young people and children.

They were having a big ol party"
"Outside of one's own spirituality and the scriptures themselves, religion is tribalism."
Yes but religion is the vehicle with which this hate is delivered.
Absolutely
"As someone who has had cancer, at least cancer can be cured."
"The women and children being bombed by Israel indeed did not murder and rape anyone. You are condemning an entire ethnic group over the acts of a terrorist organization. You are talking about ERADICATING 2 million+ human beings because some were violent. Peace is always possible, a ceasefire is the first step to ending human suffering"
"I have a distinct memory of the [Peaceful Palestinian Protests in 2018](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%932019_Gaza_border_protests). You’re right, no one on the International stage cared except for maybe Ireland."
Especially when the protests seem a lot like a celebration
"The timing also coincides with Israel declaring war on the people of Gaza, let’s remember."
What if I told you most Palestinians voted for someone other than Hamas?
"The last election was 2006. Hamas didn't even win a majority of votes. Their largest support was in Gaza. The rest of Palestine leaned more towards Fatah.

Gaza Palestinians may support Hamas, but there is a whole other part of the country that isn't launching terror attacks against Israel.

It's wild how little people know about this conflict yet have such strong feelings about it.

Edit:

Since apparently the other poster blocked me I guess ill reply here instead.

The numbers I've seen is something like 58% of Gaza residents support Hamas. So, not all do. Even then Hamas has been all these people have ever known. They've grown up with them ruling over them, using violence to keep their position. 

The Palestinian situation isn't so simple. These are people who have had definite wrongs committed against them. People who are desperate. Desperate people do desperate things. 

Hamas needs to be stopped. They are monsters, but they are monsters preying on the Palestinian people plight."
What if I told you Israeli citizens elected a fascist and racist POS
"Let me start by saying Hamas is evil and I condemn their actions and policies.

That being said, Hamas is currently their only option between total genocide and annihilation by the oppressive and abusive regime in Israel. Look at the strip their people have already been forced into on a map. There is evil on both sides.

Of course, they will support anyone who may help them, regardless of how evil they may be, if that means the choice between being forced from their lands or killed entirely."
"Or we can free palestine, but that's not going to happen. So Hamas or some other organization will continue to exist and pick off a few thousand Israelis every few years."
"Yep, it's so incredibly sad. I hope the innocents on both sides remain okay through the upcoming violence."
What kind of results has Hamas achieved besides retaliatory bombings from the IDF?
Why does the west need to be the world police? Also do we step in in every single situation? Why are you so arrogant where you think only your way of thinking is correct?
"When did I say they should do nothing to Jewish aggression? All rebuttals from those who don’t support Palestine devolve into hypotheticals in order to justify the crimes which are happening. This is a one sided conflict. Israel gets billions of dollars, has the ability to shut off their food, water, and electricity. There have been 6000 deaths on the Palestine side since 2008 and in the same time 300 Israeli deaths. How do you see that and not think Israel needs to stop what it’s doing? Israel isn’t going to collapse by giving rights to Palestine you’re making the same case slave owners did. “We cant give them rights they’ll start to do the stuff we did to them back to us”. That is justifying oppression, one state solution with equal rights is the only way out of this, there will need to be massive reparations and such as well. Anyone saying that the status quo is fine or that Israel is in the right is not looking at it clearly it’s as simple as that. 

You’re also assuming every Palestinian would want to “kill every Jew” so not only do you assume an entire race to be bloodthirsty animals it seems that you’re also saying that they’d want revenge? Why would they possibly want revenge as well could you answer this? 

Wow rape and killing civilians as well? You saying this means you have a complete blind eye towards Israel it’s actually painfully obvious you only take the perspective from one side. Israel has done for more rape and pillaging than Palestine don’t take it from me go look it up. This isn’t me justifying rape or anything either, you see I actually want everyone to stop doing this. Are you calling for this situation to be resolved peacefully? That’s what I thought. You can’t on one hand say they “would rape” people when there’s one side that’s been doing it for decades…

[Death toll and injuries on both sides](https://abcnews.go.com/amp/International/palestinian-civilians-suffer-israel-hamas-crossfire-death-toll/story?id=103828889)

The average age of a Palestinian is 18. Why do you think that is? Given the fact that the death toll on the Palestinian side is far greater why do you think it is that you only hear about it when they do something bad? It’s almost as if the people who are being oppressed don’t have much of a voice and that you’re being fed propaganda. I can’t speak for all supporters of Israel as there’s probably a lot which clearly understand what’s happening and support it but I’d like to hope that you would change your opinion if you looked at both perspectives and removed any previously held biases."

"So since the Palestinians would supposedly “wipe out” Israel then what’s happening now is okay? You’re quite literally saying that the oppression needs to continue or they will do it to them. That is not a viewpoint which should be taken seriously at all. In regards to the two state solution I think that’s a complete joke and won’t work. The only way out in my opinion is a one state solution with equal rights for everyone and democracy of some shape or form. 

Also I’m not sure if you’re doing it on purpose but it seems like you’re framing Israel as the victims which doesn’t make sense at all. A simple google search will tell you the death toll on both sides not to mention that the average AGE in Palestine IS 18.

I'm sure they eat or drink opium, because it's basically a folk/herbal medicine for that part of the world, but that is far from 'hard opiate'."
Americans have had a couple centuries of being brainwashed into believing that the underdogs are always right. It's due to them mythologizing their founding fathers and the revolution they fought for big business.

"It wont. Israel always makes sure Palestine gets more civilian deaths than they do, otherwise, Hamas would consider it a victory and be motivated into doing it again. With a 1 000 Jew death toll, I bet Israel wont stop until there's at least 10 000 dead Palestinian civils"

Yep, hamas is very predictable."

dafuq is with this anti-israel downvoting? get the fuck out of my country. vile."
"Yeah but they don't film it so it's easy to ignore it happening all the time and few foreign nationals are not caught in it so ""it's okay""."
Unfortunately true.  Both sides suck here.
"I think a lot of people have had absolutely no idea about the conflict before these last couple of days. 

It's very disturbing that governments are now preying on the ignorance of their citizens."
"Well, ya. 

Specifically going out the day after an invasion/massacre, they aren't protesting a free Palestine, they are celebrating murders. 

Why else were people chanting shit like ""800"" and ripping on jews?"
"Ya, the day after a massacre? Timing is important, these dirtbags knew what they were doing. Don't be an idiot with blinders."
"These people were given homes in Jordan, only to attempt a coup against their Jordanian benefactors. They were moved into Lebanon and did the same thing, which started a war and destabilized Lebanon so bad it is what it is today.    
       
Nobody sane wants these people anywhere near them. If anything, Egypt is even more hardcore about keeping Gaza Palestinians away from normal society."
"Lmao people were protesting before Israel even did anything!

You are claiming they are protesting, preemptively, because they assume Israel will retaliate.

Pray tell, what happened recently that is forcing Israel to retaliate?

Every country with fucked up values is supporting hamas. That should tell you something lmfao"
"I'm certain that we will see more protests of that in the coming weeks as the shock of the initial incident dies down. 

I don't know how we're going to square that because people are not naive after 9/11."

so supporting the PA/Hamas is supporting the destruction of Israel."
"Bro, the fucking schools in Palestine teach it. The government runs their fucking policies based on it.

How dumb are you?"
"Numerous peaceful resolutions were proposed - and rejected by the Palestinian side.

Israel is the stronger force and were put with the blessing of the UN.  If Palestine wants peace they need to stop attacking and finally accept a resolution rather than reject them all as they've done in the past."
"And the sheer stupidity of Hamas is going to make the situation for all Palestinians exponentially worse.   

The sheer stupidity of idiots celebrating it in Canada practically guarantees a Conservative majority in the next election."
Don't be fucking obtuse. Protesting in the wake of this is tacit approval for terrorists.
Whatever bud. You keep believing whatever bullshit you want to believe. The rest of us in the real world understand exactly what these protest/celebrations represented.

I don’t understand what you’re trying to say?
"Yea, your so called allies had called it a ""Terrorist Attack"" including your government.
So if it comes under Charter protected activities which are supporting terrorism, then you are going good mate. Enjoy and happy cesspool!"
Very few women have jobs.  There's not much else to do.
"The median age in Gaza is between 18-19 depending on the source, Israel on the other hand is 29. Given the Israeli blockade, these often young people don't have the same prospects Western or even other nations have. So it shouldn't come as a shock when an Israeli sniper shoots a child or young teenage Palestinian, because they have a lot of young Palestinian's in their population who are engaged in more conflict than say, a Westerner or their counterpart in Israel.

Moreover, the unemployment is in the 46% region and that doesn't help either."
They have lots of children.
[deleted]
"Also in many ways the poorest region on earth per capita, because of being the largest open air prison in the world. Look up the Gaza border wall. It's a full wall with watch towers and a 300m no man's land where if a Palestinian enters it they get shot."
Average ago of Palestinians in gaza is 18 years old. 40% are under the age of 16.
Do you have a link to any credible source for any rape incident or of any protestors celebrating rape explicitly? Genuinely looking for evidence for this stuff.
I just wish the killing would stop. Do they think their god (or whatever they believe in) actually *wants* them to kill non-believers?
They cannot leave Gaza even if they wanted to because they're trapped there by Israel.
Why should Egypt be forced to take 2.3 million refugees?
"I don't think so.  

We barely have any issues with Nazism here, let alone jihadists."
"Ya?  So you think that's their plan to come to Canada and start killing all the jewish people that live here and then move from country to country until all jews are gone?  Ya, you sure did some solid research there bud!"
They want to replace Israel with Palestine.  I'm sure this stuff is easy to Google so I dunno why make things up to push a narrative.  I don't like Hamas either but it just sounds absurd making stuff up.
"Sure, Must be since you say so."
"I did not say to eradicate two million people. I said that the barbarism that is Hamas must be eradicated, by any means necessary, and I stand by that. Women and children were bombed in Nazi Germany. Women and children were bombed in Imperial Japan. Because it was **total war**, and that's what happens in total war. Total war is a fight to either total destruction or complete surrender. There's no middle ground, no peace treaty, no ceasefire. 

We, sitting over here in our peaceful land, untouched by this kind of war, can't conceive that such a thing may actually be required. Not since WWII. Yet that is exactly what is required of Israel now. They **cannot** make peace with Hamas. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever. This war only ends with Hamas's unconditional surrender or its complete destruction and by complete destruction that means turning Gaza into rubble if that's what it takes, and it most likely will. Any other outcome invites Hamas to reform, rearm, and do what they did all over again, whether it be in a week, a month, a year, or a decade. 

We think ""Never again"" is a slogan. Israel was **founded upon it**. They enforce it now, in the face of this barbaric evil, or they prove those words hollow forevermore, and then there'll be no coming back from that, for them."
Did you read what I wrote
Bingo. These are anti-Israel celebrations/protests nd have the likelihood of devolving pretty quickly into antiSemitic protests (as they already have in Australia).
Its not for no reason
"No, it doesn't. The majority of these rallies were planned explicitly after 1000 jews were murdered in cold blood, with thousands more injured."
I would explain to you how elections work very slowly
"Young men growing up under oppression and apartheid, watching their people be constantly bombed, murdered, discriminated against, become radicalized and lash out against the oppressor. What a surprise."
Aye he’s a son of a bitch alright.
"Regular Palestinians throw gays off of buildings. 

Israel holds the largest pride parade in all of Asia.

There is no both sides"
"Well Hamas is about to be annihilated with how they just randomly killed a bunch of nationalities from other countries including Americans. Canada isn't going to do shit, but the United States doesn't give a fuck. They're lucky Biden is President."
Because this entire situation started because of the UN? Because the US has been sponsoring Israel for decades?
Thinking that maybe we should do something about genocide is arrogant?
"I’m talking about you saying Hamas is the only answer. My replies are about the animals seen raping, killing, and kidnapping unarmed civilians in videos this weekend. That does not equal Palestinians, it is Hamas.

Palestinians are not properly cared for by Israel, nor are they properly cared for by any countries in the Middle East. Why did Egypt not allow Palestinians to pass through there. You hear of Palestinians who just want to leave - why would Egypt not let people through? 

The murderers and rapists that I refer to are the one we saw on videos. I don’t think with that level of barbaric behaviour they can just start being nice people.  The people who were doing those atrocities were proud of what they did and they called themselves Hamas. If Hamas is good, then they would disavow this behaviour and the people who did those things. If they don’t, guess they accept those rapists and murderers as their own.

If you’re okay with Hamas doing this in response to anything Israel has done, how can you have any complaint about how Israel reacts? Is body count the only determining factor? Must only the underdog win?

And from what I can tell, the average age in Palestine is 18, but the average life expectancy is 74. This doesn’t point to people being killed off, so much as people starting to have babies very young, and having lots of kids. 

Hamas has no moral high ground after their despicable behaviour this past weekend. For anyone who would state as you did that Hamas is the only answer, my question is, does that include a Hamas who continues to round up unarmed teenage civilians just living their lives, and raping and killing them, only for the reason of being born Jewish, or of being in Israel?"
"Where do you get that from? Palestine was never a recognized state, that piece of land was owned by every major empire in the area and Jews and arabs lived there for thousands of years. This whole idea that their land was stolen is untrue, it was never theirs to begin with. 

There are almost a million Palestinians living in Israel right now, without fear of repressions. How many Israelis live in, say, Gaza?

So to you, killing 10 million people is a perfectly acceptable resolution? Just curious."
[removed]
"What you mean “supposedly”??? This is literally their position. Shit, if you did look into it (as you claim), you did a poor job, might want to try that again.

Palestine was offered a state of their own. They repeatedly rejected that. Then the poor Palestinians refugees ended up in Jordan and then in Lebanon, where they engaged in ethnic cleansings (look up Damour Massacre, etc.). There’s a reason why Egypt has a massive wall on their end - nobody wants a terrorist state nearby.

Do you not understand that Hamas is not interested in peace and equal rights for all? Their entire existence is built around fighting evil Israel, if there’s no war, there is no Hamas. It’s like if North Korea stopped threatening its neighbors, its leadership would crumple instantly.

Like I said, there are a lot of arabs in Israel, enjoying the democracy and equal rights. Not treated as second class citizens. So what’s the issue then?"
"Cool, and one atrocity excuses another? 

Palestine declared war on Isreal in 1948 along with its allies, not Isreal. Isreal didn't seek to occupy Palestine by conquest, in-fact the Palestian was hoping it would be the otherway round. They subsequently lost that war, and here we are, throwing stones back and forth forever, claiming the other was first to throw. It doesn't matter at this point, they've both been throwing stones long enough to share enough culpability for the current situation. No one is the good guy here!

In saying that, the way the Palestines have conducted themselves shouting, ""god is great"" as they mow down innocent people, and then parading their bodies around like trophies has been absolutely atrocious. If you feel that killing your ""enemies"" is a necessary evil, at least do so with respect and understand the full gravity of your actions. To take another's life, especially an innocent one, is nothing to celebrate. This in my eyes, has caused me to lose all respect for the Palestinian cause. They seem to take pride and joy in the death and destruction they bring, not view it with dispear or a necessary evil for a cause. At least the Isreali's don't hold a parade every time they kill a Palestinian."
"SOURCE?!

Are you SERIOUS? Afghanistan has one of the worst opioid epidemics on the planet. It's one of the primary things they blame on the western action. 

I am not spoon feeding you the Afghan opioid addiction epidemic. ONE google search if you cared for a SECOND. You need to learn how differentiate good sources and do research too. Do you think WHEN you google it you will find I am wrong? Or that the Afghans will be saying its a problem that is everyone elses fault?

You think they grow most of the worlds heroin and don't have an addiction problem? You think there aren't coke heads in LATAM?"

I don’t believe that to be true.
"No, the goal for Israel is not to kill civilians.  If it could, it would kill zero.

But Hamas will cease to exist after this conflict.  Right now this is 100% about regime change.  Anything short of that is failure."
Dude if it was America they would have carpet bombed and borderline nuked the place decades ago. Israel is going above and beyond given the circumstances. One need only look to iraq and Syria and how many civilians the US killed in indiscriminate bombing.
What are ya gonna do? Turn off my electricity and water and withhold food?
"They do, look at the post history in /r/Palestine there’s been videos on there for decades"
"And making people feel that Israel is an innocent victim in all this. Which, of course, they aren't."
What what are the governments doing? They are just condemning the actions of Hamas...
">Nobody sane wants these people anywhere near them.

Historically there has been so many groups talked about like that.  It actually is disturbing."
.... before they did anything? Let's not act as if NOTHING was going on before this and Israel is innocent of what incited this in the first place.
Unfortunately the media is out in full force dehumanizing Palestinians and manufacturing consent for genocide
…As does Iran.
People aren't supporting Hamas unless they are extremists.
That’s interesting because top Israeli government [officials openly call for entire Palestinian villages to be wiped out and eradicated](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/03/01/middleeast/west-bank-smotrich-ned-price-intl/index.html). No one had an issue with this though right
"You do understand that one can be pro-Palestinian people without being pro-Hamas, right?"
"No, they don't.

But even if they did, the only one carrying out a genocide right now is Netanyahu."
Take a look at those “resolutions” and you’ll understand why they’re rejected
"I’d be happy to see the liberal government go, very happy indeed, and anyone celebrating Crimea against humanity should be held to account. But I will not ignore Israel’s violations and murders, that would be a dishonour to the victims."
">all Palestinians exponentially worse

No, things can't really get ""exponentially"" worse for Palestinians in Gaza. Things there are already incredibly bad."
"\> And the sheer stupidity of Hamas is going to make the situation for all Palestinians exponentially worse.

No, actually. Israel shutting down all food, gas, electricity and water and bombing every square inch of the Gaza strip is what is going to make the situation exponentially worse. 

Please stop acting like all of the crimes and violence committed against Palestine is suddenly meaningless."
">The sheer stupidity of idiots celebrating it in Canada practically guarantees a Conservative majority in the next election.

Bingo."
"No it’s not! People protest regularly at the crimes against the Palestinian people. In fact half of Palestine didn’t even vote them. Your outrage is laughable!! Where your outrage at the human rights violations ? Where’s it at with the consistent killing of civilians ? Including children throwing rocks. But no you’re outraged now lol yes Hamas is bad we all know this, yes terrorism is an unforgivable crime, but to ignore the state sponsored terror, the oppression is plain ducking stupid. How on earth will the cycle of violence stop if you don’t go to the root cause."

"Do you know they bombed the Egypt crossing twice and threatened to bomb any trucks attempting to cross.

You’re pretty much asking why a fascist military dictatorship will tacitly approve a genocide committed by a fascist apartheid regime.
"What does this mean, why should the NATIVE Palestinians be driven out further - and why should Egypt take them just because they're the same religion?

Where should the Palestinian Christians and atheists go?"

"perhaps take a step back and explain why there is a blockade by Israel and Egypt on Gaza? 

Israel left gaza in 2006, and there wasn't always a blockade. What changed? What happened to make Israel impose a blockade?"
Ah. That explains it.
Yeah after what happened they’re not lifting the blockade. If anything it’ll reinforce why they had it in the first place - I haven’t bothered to follow the politics of it previously but Hamas just painted themselves on equal footing as ISIS and Al Qaeda in the world’s eyes.
Well yeah. Look what happened when they weren't stopped from crossing the border.
"Any reason why Egypt, a fellow Arab nation also keeps them locked up in this “prison”? You make it sound like Gaza is surrounded by only Israel and the sea. 

Maybe it’s because Egypt doesn’t want murdering rapists in their country.

It’s almost like murderers and rapists belong in a prison."
"no country is required to let someone across the border.

same with Gaza and Israel. 

Israel can decide who can/can't enter its country."
Umm where did I say anything of the sort?  I’m just correcting your misguided belief that their ideology is not based in religion. It’s quite “easy to google” 😂
"The stuff i have said, can be easily googled also. Don't know why you equate being horrified by the killing of Israelis with being pro killing Palestinians... Hamas keeps using Palestinians as human shields for collateral damage in order to push there propaganda. Like installing there rocket launchers, on top of schools, hospitals and densely populated areas."
"Your argument pre-supposed that bombing Gaza into annihilation will successfully defeat Hamas. History shows that indiscriminate bombing almost always does not achieve strategic outcomes, and usually only serves to kill and maim civilians. History of this conflict shows that bombing and besieging Gaza, has not defeated Hamas, and radicalises civilians in further support of Hamas. Your position is informed by bloodlust and collective vengeance in a conflict you have no personal stakes in, not any strategic coherence. 

Have you ever considered that the Israeli government should take steps to stop segregating, evicting, occupying and settling Arab communities? 

Have you ever considered that ethnostates, which Israel is, are unethical? 

Have you ever considered that a one-state, secular and ethnically-neutral solution is possible? And, the Israeli gov't, by maintaining an ethnostate, is blocking said solution? 

Have you considered that the Israel government had a role in creating Hamas, in order to undermine moderate Palestinians?

"Treating gay people well doesn’t change how many Palestinian children they’ve murdered. There is absolutely “both sides” here, and they’re both monstrous."
Agreed. I wish we had a leader with the balls to stand up for his people instead of giving the people with the power to do something about it Thanksgiving off.
"So you think the e solution is…? What? To abandon Israel? I mean I’d agree, why should the west be cow-towing to Israel or any other country, for that matter?"
Holy shit please tell me where I said anything positive about Hamas I think they’re fucking awful. You’re the one excusing the actions of Israel blatantly. I’m saying they’re both bad and that Israel has the power to stop this. Hamas “stopping Israel” isn’t part of their plans they are extremely fundamentalist.
You’re defeating your own argument. You’re exactly right no Israeli would want to live in Gaza since they’re bombing it lmao
"Answer the question please, what percentage?"
Did you just assume my ethnicity?
"Hamas isn’t Palestine. 

They were being given awful outcomes on any land partitioning that was done even when they were the majority.

You keep acting like I’m a supporter of Hamas when I have said anything but that. IN MY ORIGINAL COMMENT I SAID IM ANTI HAMAS. So why do you keep throwing that in there incredibly disingenuous.

Then being equal is blatantly false. I wonder why there’s things such as Jewish roads and different license plates.  🤔"
"Please point to where I said one atrocity excuses another. 

Hamas and Israel are the bad guys and those who want freedom and peace are the good guys Israeli or Palestinian. You’re simultaneously saying there’s no good guys and then arguing on behalf of one of the “bad guys” do you not realize this?

The same thing once again. Every single time supporters of Israel will conflate Hamas and Palestine. They’ve been oppressed for decades and their last line of “defence” is a bunch of fundamentalist terrorist barbarians. What did you think was going to happen? Look at what happened in Afghanistan with the Taliban, they used to be far more progressive before all of the war. 

To this last point about the parades I just find this hilarious. You’re saying that a parade determines how bad it is and not the actual death toll? Go search up the death toll on both sides please. If you’re not going to then we don’t have anything more to say. NO ONE SHOULD BE KILLING IN THE FIRST PLACE. You’re taking the “killing” as a given which needs to happen. Actually insane take."
"They grow opium, not heroine.

"Go on wikipedia, look at every war Israel was in before, look at the death count on each sides, soldiers, civilian deaths. Look it up."
True otherwise it would turn Gaza into a parking lot in less than an hour.  They are targeting to avoid killing civilians as much as possible.
"Ok so here's the thing. Once israel gets rid of Hamas which they might do. What next? Are they going to lift the illegal blockade and occupation? Will they stop the illegal settlements? Because if they don't, there will always be another hamas like party ready to jump in. So what happens when all this is over is  what I'm curious about"
"Basically none? It always made the news when they did. Virtually all the killing in Iraq was Iraqi's murdering other Iraqi's. Which you could argue only happened because if Arabs don't have oppressive dictators they just slaughter one another...

America wasn't in Syria in any significant way, are you sure you don't mean Assad / Russia?"
Everyone's nice compared to America. Moot point.
They’ll build an even bigger and better concentration camp!
"what are you gonna do, cheer on hamas while they do this despicable shit?"
"Most of the citizens are innocent.

"Which is good!

But they are not also condemning the retaliation.  Which is bad."
"Very true!   
     
Now.     
     
Do YOU think it's a good idea to let people whose population includes terrorists who gleefully participated in mass rapes, kidnappings, and murders become your neighbours?"
Is it the media or the fact Hamas took videos of themselves gleefully brutalizing civilians and desecrating their bodies while Palestinians celebrated?
"The Palestinians voted Hamas in and the majority continue to support them.

As for the protestors here in Canada:

>More than a thousand people congregated at Toronto's Nathan Phillips Square Monday afternoon... many a refused to condemn those attacks

____________________
Reminder on what the Palestinians voted for and support:

The Islamic Resistance Movement, also known as the HAMAS, is an extremist fundamentalist Islamic organization operating in the territories under Israeli control. Its Covenant is a comprehensive manifesto comprised of 36 separate articles, all of which promote the basic HAMAS **goal of destroying the State of Israel.**

Article 13:

>**Rejection of a negotiated peace settlement:**

""[Peace] initiatives, and so-called peaceful solutions and international conferences are in contradiction to the principles of the Islamic Resistance Movement... Those conferences are no more than a means to appoint the infidels as arbitrators in the lands of Islam... **There is no solution for the Palestinian problem except by Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are but a waste of time, an exercise in futility.""**"
man some of you are so entrenched in your ideology that you're willing to enforce whataboutism on two genocidal governments just because one side is politically fashionable.
"most Palestinians support Hamas though:

https://coopwb.in/info/how-many-palestinians-support-hamas/"
">Take a look at those “resolutions” and you’ll understand why they’re rejected

I don't understand - they were reasonable and preferable to the prevailing status quo.  

What's *your* understanding on why they were rejected?

>[the Peel Committee, assembled by the UN, offered a partition plan that offered to give Palestinians 80% of the land and 20% to the Jews. The Jews agreed and Palestinians refused. Numerous other peace offers were made since the 80’s, most famous ones were the Oslo Accords in 1993, Camp David in 2000, and the Ehud Olmert offer in 2003. All of them included giving the Palestinians the occupied lands from 1967, East Jerusalem as a capital, normalization and mutual recognition: The Palestinians refused every one of these offers.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_peace_process)"
If the Palestinians want lasting peace and stability they need to rid themselves of Hamas and actually agree to a peaceful resolution.
They're raping and murdering people. What do you want the Israelis and Egyptians to do? Give them participation ribbons?

"Any idiot with 1/4 the brainpower of a mushroom would know that Israel would escalate violence to new levels after the attacks.

So yep.   Sheer stupidity of Hamas."

"Left Gaza = emptied 20 + illegal settlements with around 9000 illegal settlers (even in the eyes of Israel) that was impossible to defend. Also the Gaza pop density makes it impossible to build and expand settlements. 

Perhaps you should go back a tad to tell others that most of the Gaza residents are refugees from other cities and towns that got ethnically cleansed by Israel. 

Then Israel proceeds to blockade them in the world's biggest prison. 

What about the west bank? No rockets there but the same apartheid stealing land and building illegal settlements. Changing the status of Jerusalem. Annexing occupied land. 

It's time Israel is held accountable and forced to respect UN resolutions and withdraw from occupied territories. There is no other path for peace."
"Damn, it really did not take very long for you to get him to unmask and justify the terrorism as ""resistance"". Some people refuse to believe that others have agency and choose to continue to bomb and murder innocents, and get the consequences of those actions."
"The more I've considered this, I think the rave was what turned this into the absolute PR disaster that it has been for the Palestinians.  That's where the vast bulk of the international tourists were.  Kids from all over the world at a rave in the desert just having fun. 

It is horrific to say, but if the Palestinians had just driven on by or done this on a different day, then the world would have just seen this as more Palestinian on Jew violence, tut-tutted, and moved on.  The senseless massacre of so many attractive German, American, French, Canadian, Russian, Chinese, etc young men and women turned this into something that even Iran was ""Nope, we had nothing to do with it.""  Their televised slaughter, rape, and parading of the bodies was what turned the world that had spent most of the recent past incredibly being pissed off and sending hard messages to Israel to reform -- ex. [Biden](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/president-biden-pledges-to-address-hard-issues-related-to-democracy-as-he-meets-with-israel-pm-netanyahu) and [Trudeau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBdKwVuKftY) earlier this year -- into instant allies willing to give them a blank cheque.."
"The violence  commited by the Hamas Guerillas is diplorable, but you have to ask yourself why do so many want/ need to commit such violent acts. In my opinion it's because their entire existence has been locked up in Gaza experiencing nothing but suffering under the boot of apartheid Israel. If you look people up in a cage and take away their humanity by nature they are going to lash out."

"I'm sure the answer is nuanced and complicated, but it not likely because a small majority of the 2.2million people in Gaza are acting out in violent ways. [Egypt advocates for restraint ](https://www.reuters.com/world/egypt-pushing-israel-hamas-prevent-escalation-egyptian-sources-2023-10-09/)

Some immediate thoughts is they are protecting themselves from the spill over of Gaza refugees. 

Another is that with Israel being the de facto presence of the US they prefer to keep their distance... 

Again why are their people in Gaza that feel the need for violent retribution against Israelis? The apartheid state of Israel and their ongoing oppression of Palestinians since 1948... Just might be a factor."
"They identify as muslims but their mandate is not to go on some holy rampage and randomly kill jews but to fight an armed resistance against Israel.  Unfortunately your reading comprehension is not great so Google won't help you.  Read below, I know the word ""Islamic"" is in there but try hard.  Their main cause is political and not religious, to fight an armed resistance against Israeli occupation.  BTW, there are more words that come after this but thought this should be enough for now.

"" In 1988, Hamas published its charter, calling for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic society in historic Palestine. In what observers called an attempt to moderate its image, Hamas presented a new document \[PDF\] in 2017 that accepted an interim Palestinian state along the “Green Line” border established before the Six-Day War but that still refused to recognize Israel."""
Out of curiosity... Do you know what a fatwa is?  What fatwa did they issue?

Hamas shoots rockets and then hides behind children. The collateral damage is on their hands.
"It should be up the UN to do something about this, send in peacekeepers, call out Israel for its war crimes, help set up a legitimate government for Palestine, return the colonized land, etc., but that won’t happen cuz the US would block all such measures."
"Looks like I misunderstood you then. I read that you were pro Palestine, that you were anti Israel, and that Hamas was the only right answer here. Now I realize you stating 2 items with a comma rather than a conjunction, but the second item is compound with a conjunction joining the 2 things you’re ‘anti.’ I read it as the conjunction joining the final in a list of 3 ideas. The lack of Oxford comma could have clued me in. I’m just not accustomed to people listing things without the word ‘and.’

So we agree Hamas are terrible. We seem to disagree in that I also think the  government in Israel is not doing the right thing in terms if Palestinian people, but neither is any government in the area. If they are being kept there (I’ve read about people saying they have want to leave but aren’t allowed), then Egypt is doing that too. I also think doesn’t seem to be a way for Jews to exist right now without some degree of violence, simply because they are constantly targeted just for being there, and they strongly defend themselves, sometimes proactively. 

I do reiterate though that the average age of 18 or 19 can’t be attributed simply to being killed off, when the average life expectancy is 74. To me this means that people are doing well enough to survive to a relatively advanced age, and also are doing well enough to reproduce prolifically.

The concept of the “open air prison,” which gets tossed around without any mention of the fact that Egypt built and maintains one of the walls of said “prison,” means the complete story isn’t being told there either. 

The history also is longer and more complex than the past however many years people mention, and it is not just about Israel and Palestine. 

The measure of suffering of any individual isn’t minimized by the fact that more have suffered on the other side of the issue. The victims in Israel aren’t the first, and their pain is real.

When you talked about Israel, Palestine, and Hamas as distinct entities, but no differentiating of the Israeli government from its people, does that mean that they are one and the same, whereas Palestinians aren’t considered same as Hamas? I personally think they are both separate, but it’s not really said the same as everyone is very careful to separate Hamas and Palestine."
"How come there are no Jews in Jordan then? Or in Lebanon? Maybe because they don’t survive there?

I like how you ignored the rest of my comment. Nothing to contribute? With all that research you’ve done, surely you can elaborate beyond general statements?"
"I don’t engage in pointless polemics with people who don’t understand the issue and support terrorists who kill women and behead children, sorry. You’re the type who would’ve been justifying holocaust."
">Every single time supporters of Israel will conflate Hamas and Palestine

Well considering im yet to see a single Palestian on any news network who is interviewed condemn Hamas for their actions, instead of immediately go to blaming Isreal when questioned about it. The lines seem to be rather blurred. You can condemn both Isreal and Hamas, yet that's not what they seem to be doing, only one.

>They’ve been oppressed for decades and their last line of “defence” is a bunch of fundamentalist terrorist barbarians

""Defence"" doesn't involve going out of your way to attack unarmed civilians. They are also far worse off antagonizing these attacks form Isreal because of it. The attacks achieve absolutely nothing but death for Isreali civilians, that are then met with retaliation on Gaza with 10x the force. Leading to the deaths of innocent civilians there.

>Look at what happened in Afghanistan with the Taliban, they used to be far more progressive before all of the war. 

Taliban and progressive don't go in the same sentence.

>You’re saying that a parade determines how bad it is and not the actual death toll?

No, it shows that people aren't taking open joy in the death of their ""enemy"". That's what my point is, if you much kill your ""enemy"", the least you can do is take no joy in it."
Ok I’ll check it out
"Your missing the point. I’m showing you that if Israel wanted they could obliterate the city of Gaza but they aren’t, and doing so would not be unprecedented in the Middle East. So your point is wrong"
I'm not cheering either side. Both are guilty.
You can disagree with actions but also fully understand why they happen.
Ok but most counties would do the exact same thing in this situation. 9/11 etc.
"What would Canada do if, for example, an indigenous Reserve started launching thousands of rockets into nearby towns, and armed fighters marched into those towns gunning down anybody they could find?"
I do not. And after seeing these celebrations held in major Canadian cities (among others around the world) I believe we have.
"If you can point me out the individuals that participated in those things, I'll agree I want nothing to do with them and it's abhorrent. 

If you're talking about a blanket statement regarding an entire people, I'm sorry but I can't agree there."
"The media is ignoring the immediate response of leveling 4 towers and killing many more children. The media is ignoring how 300 children are arrested yearly by Israeli occupation forces. The media is ignoring how settlers go around lynching people. 

It only covers the Israeli side because it does not see Palestinians or arabs generally as humans."
"Except one side is an actual government that receives billions of dollars in funding from all countries across the west, has an advanced military, and is above international law; the other is a group of pretty unorganized resistance fighters that have lived in an open air prison with limited water, food and electricity their entire lives. They don’t even have the power to be a genocidal government if they tried"
I think the important thing here is that you've decided you're better than everyone else as rockets rain down on innocent children in the largest open-air prison on the planet. Congratulations!
"First of all, Ur linking to literally nothing. Im guessing you just wrote that and added a hyper link.

And palestine DID NOT reject all of them. Palestine literally signed the Oslo accord and thats not hard to fact check. 

AFTER they signed that one israel didn’t return any of the occupied land and continued to expand into it"
">If the Palestinians want lasting peace and stability they need to rid themselves of Hamas and actually agree to a peaceful resolution.

Hamas doesn't have control of the West Bank. Has that brought ""peace and stability"" to the lives of Palestinians there?"
"The first question you should ask is why Gaza is reliant on Israel for these resources in the first place. Israel has forced Gaza to become reliant on it for all basic necessities because they've blockaded its borders. That now puts them in a position to starve everyone because of the actions of Hamas.

As with everything in this situation, it's very complex and there is a lot of history leading to this point. There is never a justification for terrorist acts of any kind, let alone the atrocities committed by Hamas. But that doesn't mean the Israeli policies didn't play a key role in creating an environment in Gaza that is highly conducive to radicalization and extremism. I don't know what the path to peace is, but it certainly doesn't start with starving out 2 million Palestinians in Gaza."
"Because invading a country, conquering the native people, and then subjecting those people to living conditions intended to bring about their destruction (depriving them of food and water; filling in their wells with cement, etc) is what the UN describes as genocide."
"Because collective punishment is a war crime. Israel is committing war crimes. But look back in history, war crimes, and Israel go hand in hand."
"Israel, bombed it twice and issued a warning they will bomb any crossing trucks.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-said-to-bomb-rafah-crossing-to-egypt-after-telling-gazans-to-flee-through-it/

https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20231010-israel-threatens-to-bomb-egypt-aid-trucks-heading-to-gaza/

Also to address your original question. Palestinians in Arab countries are trouble because they will call for Israeli resistance which undermines the positions of the weak and illigetimate Arab governments. Additionally in some countries they can create an imbalance of power like Lebanon or Jordan. 

Lastly and more importantly, Palestinians belong in Palestine. The refugees in Gaza should go back to their Palestinian homes rather than be forced to flee to become refugees elsewhere."
"Ok. Reiterate for me how l support nazi. That was an ambiguous response. More funny, the total jump to nazi supporter.

"And Nazis =/= Germany right?

I hope you realize how poor that argument is. People can be complicit to the actions of evil without being being a card carrying member.

It’s a sad reflection on Palestine that the people allow Hamas to exist in their country. But I guess it’s either that or they would also be killed. Rock and a hard place right? So I ask, who do the Palestinians really need liberation from?

Who are the true oppressors in Palestine?"
[deleted]
It's literally the same comments that this sub always says whenever it's anyone but right wing white people protesting...  I wonder why that is?
i am still waiting for you to explain why israel and egypt have a blockade on gaza.
"Yeah exactly, if they attacked military targets thats one thing, killing civilians and broadcasting it on video lost them any sympathy they might’ve had. I feel like most people didn’t know enough about this conflict (myself included) to pick a side since both sides are always protesting and complaining about the other, but they just swayed global public opinion towards Israel."
They do it because they hate Jews and get paid to fight them; killing Jews is one of the few jobs available to them due to their craptacular government
You haven’t answered my question. Why doesn’t Egypt let them through?
"Palestinians rejected the offer for their own state 3+ times. They chose blood shed and lost every war they themselves started.

May the people of Gaza rot in the desert so humanities progress may resume."
"Your making this more complicated So is Hamas founded on religious principles, yes or no? Simple question."
"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatwa)

Only thing i could find quickly is just some countries issuing some against Hamas. But i wouldn't be surprised if Hamas had one for killing all jews."
"So completely surrender and allow Palestine to murder literally everyone? Yeah man that’s not a solution either. Parts of what you said are good but I dunno. It’s all too complicated and there’s too much history for anyone here, (you included) to know what to do for the best outcome."
"Yeah none of the governments in the area are good. The people in Gaza have one way out and that’s death. Netanyahu recently told them to “leave” I believe but that isn’t possible since Egypt is keeping them in as well.

Also I meant to say median age not average. But it is important, in Israel it’s 29 and for reference Canada it’s 40. The point of it being that these people are most likely to be very young and have known nothing but horror their entire lives. The death toll is extremely high on the Palestinian side compared to Israel as well.

My perspective on the history of the region is a simple one. I don’t give a fuck who lived where and when just let whoever wants to live there live there. A one state solution with equal rights is the only peaceful way out of this. Two state solution will inevitably lead to more conflict over land disputes and such again.

Israel also has a right to defend itself and if we were funding their defence like Ukraine that’s one thing but we’re funding them treating Palestinians like animals.

In regards to your point about the distinction I’m making I’ll explain myself. The same way I refer to “Israel” is the same way I do about any other country. Russia for example I will call Russia evil but I don’t hold hatred towards the average Russian citizen right? But when people refer to Hamas they act as if all Palestinians are aligned with them not to mention they have no other options. Hamas isn’t even a “government” they don’t even control the food, water, and electricity of their own “territory” so Hamas is a terrorist extremist group and Israel is a countries government. I’ve stated many times in this thread to others that I have nothing but sympathy for Israelis who don’t want this same for Palestinians. The bad actors in this is the Israeli government and Hamas.

Edit: Also I’d like to mention that I’m at the very least grateful that you’re the first person who is actually having a proper conversation even though we disagree. I find it incredibly annoying that I have to constantly clarify myself when I’ve tried my best to make myself clear. Hamas is evil, Israel is oppressing Palestinians. Civilians on either side are not to blame only the lunatics with power."
"Jews were driven out, I think, countries around there were okay with Jews having Israel, once upon a time. All the hate on Israel for putting Palestinians in an ‘open air jail’, but not a word about all the other countries in the area that are fine with it or want Jews dead. And nothing about Egypt, who owns a wall of that open air prison, and thus has the key to let Palestinians out."
"I don’t know why, if I had to take a wild guess I’d say they probably went to Israel. Is there a death toll of Jews in those places you mentioned to backup what you’ve said? In regards to land being one people or another honestly I don’t give a shit these are people dying on the Israeli side and even more so on the Palestinian side. Have some fucking humanity and think man you’re not arguing for a solution simply the status quo. You’re actually evil do some self reflection. I know I’m right here you’re justifying oppression."
"Lmao I understand the issue perfectly, and will plainly say Fuck Hamas (and the IDF).  
  
Now what's your excuse?
What percentage?"
"There you go you’ve shown your true colours. You started off with there’s no good guys yet argue only on behalf of one side. Don’t actually understand what I’m saying or respond in ways where you purposely misinterpret or are just are plain stupid. Hamas is evil, Israel or more specifically its government is evil if you need me to say that, and Palestinians are being oppressed. I sympathize for any innocents on both sides and want it to come to an end. But it seems you just can’t bring yourself to sympathize with the Palestinians. You’re a great critical *thunker* for sure"
"We are all alive because of how generous and nice the powerful people are, to allow us to live. Such boundless generosity"
"They attacked because they hate their freedoms, just like 9/11.  That's all the information people can hold in their head."
Which we already know was the wrong response.
"Most Canadians and many Americans see our response to 9/11 as a mistake. It cost trillions of tax dollars, killed Canadians, Americans, Afghanis and Iraqis and accomplished nothing but perpetuating violence and spawned ISIS/ISIL. Who then terrorized numerous countries in the middle east while we said ""oopsie"" and drone striked the area into non-existence. The Taliban was in control before we entered Afghanistan, and they are back in control now."
They would arrest the people responsible.
Understandable. I used to think like you do.
"so what? Israel is suceesful, in spite of all the arab countries that have tried to destroy them. 

the PA had money being thrown at it after oslo. It had international, and Israeli goodwill. what happened?  

hamas/PA aren't successful because they have rampant corruption, and never spent the time developing a stable, functional society/bureaucracy. They were too busy trying to destroy israel. 

and none of that justifies the muder/rape/mutilation/kidnapping of hundreds of civilians.

so Hamas is upset that they are dysfunctional and take it out on Israel?

sigh. the open air prison myth again?  there is a border, Israel, like canada, and every other country, doesn't need to let anyone in to their country they do not want to. 

limited water-food-electricity - take it up with the authority in charge of the gaza strip - i.e. hamas, this is not an israel issue. If you have a blackout in BC, do you expect alaska to provide you with electricity? they may, but are they required? And let;s suppose BC would regularly shoot rockets at Alaska, and had just killed 900 alaskans, do you still think they should provide you with free electricity? or anything?"
"""it's ok if they do unspeakably terrible things because 'insert politics here'""

ok fam you do you, just don't be surprised when palestine support drops dramatically"
"Then why did they deny, sabotage, and refuse 5 different peace accords?"
"There are militants in the West Bank - Israel has found itself under attack from both Gaza and the WB. 

- If the Palestinians want lasting peace and stability they need to rid themselves of Hamas, cease supporting terrorist attacks, and actually agree to a peaceful resolution."
"How do you feel then about sanctioning the Russian people who didn't vote for their dictator leader or his war?

I'm going to take a wild stab that a lot of the very nuanced individuals with this hot take are perfectly fine with that collective punishment."
"I'm not the redditor who asked about why the other countries won't take the Palestinians, but I don't understand your response. Could you clarify what you meant when you said that the Palestinians would call for Israeli resistance? Do you mean they would ask those governments to join the war?"
"https://youtu.be/vCWMBvxWKL0?si=A-Cldi92q5WsdQov

Look at what the children of Palestine preach. They support Hitler. They’re Nazis."
"Right okay I think I got you.


You figure that these gatherings are legal and Charter protected, but advocate for orgs that break other rights that are charter protected. So although they may be legal, they're morally condemnable. Am I understanding you?"
"Some Palestinians cheer for the slaughter of Israeli civilians.

Some Israelis cheer for the slaughter of Palestinian civilians.

That does not make either side a monolith. You are being incredibly reductionist and it is not helping. This conflict is not about you."
"The Palestinian people protested Hamas this year and were met with brutality. You should read a bit about Palestinian politics, they are not a functional democracy. Yo"
How can you say with such certainty all the protests are pro-Hamas?  Olivia Chow denounced the protest as unsanctioned before anyone even came together.
"Resistance. They expect Palestinians to give up. They never will. 

Egypt works with Israel. Currently, Egypt did not close the crossing with Gaza, Israel bombed it twice and warned it will bomb any aid trucks planning to cross."
"As someone who just learned about the conflict, do you feel equally disgusted at the IDFs targeting of civilians in retaliatory strikes? I'm not judging, I'm just curious about your perception."
I answered it on the other comment chain.
"And there it is. You think of them as subhuman rather then considering the complexity of nuance of millions of people trying to survive in a complicated situation. I support all humans living together in peace first, but global powers make that difficult in so many ways. Why do you think the US government funds the Israeli military so much? 

I agree that the violence from Hamas Guerillas is diplorable, but are their crimes a reason to bomb all 2.2 million people in Gaza, the largest open air prison on the world?"
Literally nothing I said means that. PEACEkeepers.
"No I hear you and I think it’s not right, my big thing is that I don’t think Israel/Jews would survive one state, but many of them were also born there. 

I also think it can’t be said enough that everyone around there is making the situation worse for the Palestinian people."
"Have you actually read the Hamas Covenant? Specifically this part: “There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are all a waste of time and vain endeavors”

There is no dialogue - one side wants to wipe the other side out completely, so excuse them for not wanting to go along with it.

I’ve seen many examples of Palestinians targeting civilians specifically, just like they did a few days ago. Say what you want about the Israelis, but at least they don’t use women and children as human shields. 
And the fact that tons of Palestinians are out on the streets celebrating this senseless massacre tell me everything I need to know."
"Lol at the “understand the issue perfectly”. There are hundreds of scholars spending their careers trying to understand the issue, and this one got it all figured it out, perfectly too. Fucking textbook Dunning-Kruger effect case study here.

Percentage of what? You sneakily deleted your initial comment, can’t handle the downvotes?"
This conversation has run its course though you’re not actually hoping things get any better.
"I'm arguing your points, which is overwhelming in defense of Palestine. So forgive me if my comments seem one-sided. If you want to start arguing in favour of Isreal I will happily oblige in arguing in favour of the otherside...

I am overwhelming sympathizing with the unnecessary death that is occurring and about to occur. Which is why I can't understand how any Palestinian could even remotely support the actions undertaken by Hamas right now. This time around, the responsibility will solely lie at the feet of Hamas due to their unnecessary and pointless brutality and violence."
What would be a correct response?
"Sure a mistake in hindsight, but at the time everyone was pretty fuckin gung-ho about the entire thing. Hell even to this day, over 20 years later, the scars of 9/11 are used as justification for action against X or Y group. That's to say, no one is going to condemn the retribution, because they know that not only would they do the same thing, they all *have* done the same thing in the past.

Its not good, but an unprovoked attack on a civilian population usually leads to the hammer being dropped on whoever is responsible. In this case Israel declared full on war."
"Arrest? Sorry, you think they would *arrest* armed gunmen shooting their way through homes and businesses?

You do know how RCMP officers treat indigenous people in Canada, right?"
">hamas/PA aren't successful because they have rampant corruption, and never spent the time developing a stable, functional society/bureaucracy. They were too busy trying to destroy israel. 

>so Hamas is upset that they are dysfunctional and take it out on Israel?

Right.  Well, except...

>[Most of the time, Israeli policy was to treat the Palestinian Authority as a burden and Hamas as an asset. Far-right MK Bezalel Smotrich, now the finance minister in the hardline government and leader of the Religious Zionism party, said so himself in 2015. According to various reports, Netanyahu made a similar point at a Likud faction meeting in early 2018, when he was quoted as saying that those who oppose a Palestinian state should support the transfer of funds to Gaza, because maintaining the separation between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza would prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/)

When a right-wing fascist government with complete control of its opponents props up a militant opponent over an opponent that actually recognises Israel (the Palestinian Authority), we call events like this blowback. 

Which doesn't negate the civilian victims of any attack. But this is what Netanyahu wanted, this is what he made happen. 

Also, Israel *is* like Canada, good example. Canada also kept its undesireable minorities in open-air prisons for generations."
What  Palestinian support? All major world Governments stand firmly behind Israel. As does the media. The narrative has been skewed for decades.
"Uh, sanctioning and bombing/destruction are two vastly different things. You can't compare the two in the slightest. 

Can you possibly, with a straight face, say that the collective punishment of Russians is anywhere near the collective punishment of Palestinians? Seems to me, from the news I've seen, Russians are pretty much going about their daily lives. Are Palestinians?

There's my nuanced take for you."
"If you read closely the history of the conflict. Arabs have always had the same position but that isn't true for their governments. Without going into boring details, today most Arab states have a pro Israel stance in practice. Even at the peak of the wars against Israel some Arab regimes walked the opposite direction and worked with Israel. 

If you just look at normalization with Israel, that's not what the Arab people want. Not without a Palestinian state. But Arab leaders depend on the US and work with Israel to maintain their grip on power. It is known most oppressive Arab countries had access and used the Pegasus software to spy on their people. 

It's more about their level of alliance with Israel.  None of these states would ever consider going to war with Israel, many are buying weapons from Israel today."
"It’s like having a protest in the southern states for “states right.”

"um, resistance to what? Gaza had territory, access to the world, and international aid. 

they had no jews or IDF soldiers. What were they resisting again that resulted in the blockade?

and why does Egypt work with Israel on the blockade?"
"Good question. Not equally disgusted, as I see a difference between explicitly targeting civilians for shock value (terrorism, what Hamas did), and civilians being collateral damage to military/terrorist targets. It sounds like Israel is giving some warnings prior to the airstrikes to allow people to leave/move out of the way as well to minimize this damage."
That is correct. I absolutely 100% believe that those who rape and murder innocent women and children are sub human. You are welcome to quote me on that any Time. I also 100% believe anyone who would defend those actions and cheer for it in the streets are *just as subhuman*
"I mean yeah it kinda does. And you expect Palestine to NOT bomb the shit out of Israel? They’ve been doing it for years, and if they became legitimized, or ally’s only get worse. You’re actively hoping for more dead Israelis."
Well then technically we’re at the same place. But the fact is people have been dying for decades. The status quo will mean that more and more will die as things escalate. One state is one possible solution but I think that doing nothing to try and improve things is far worse.
"You just ignored everything I said. Also Hamas isn’t representative of Palestine that’s like saying America is Maga because trump got elected. The reason there isn’t dialogue is because of Israel. You’re seriously acting like Israel is oppressed? That’s completely false, Hamas is evil, and Israel is oppressing Palestinians. You’re not living in reality, you’re actively on the side of evil and acting like they’re victims. The victims are the innocent civilians on both sides and you’re calling one side murders and rapists. You’re the real monster for having such an abhorrent take."
"Must have been removed, I'm still seeing it on my end."

"israel screwed up by supporting hamas - no question.

but there is still no open air prison.

there is a border, Israel, like canada, and every other country, doesn't need to let anyone in to their country they do not want to.  certainly not an enemy that has the stated goal of wiping israel off the map. and Israel would let in, as of last week 20k gazans to work in israel."
"The comment you are replying to was decrying cutting off aid and electricity as monstrous, not bombing.  And you decried it as a collective punishment, That's a sanction, it's no different at all.  One type of collective punishment is okay but another is not?  Don't go worrying yourself though, our government has made it clear they are going to keep pumping in the aid and ""make sure it doesn't go to hamas"" (spoiler it's going to hamas and it always was)."
"My guy, this conflict has been going on for generations. If you think Saturday was the first act of aggression you need to open a history textbook.

"Yes they definitely are, as Bibi's fascistic regime."
"I don’t think it’s a celebration of the Hamas’ atrocities per se, but some ill perceived notions of long awaited “justice” for their opposition.  Perhaps it’s a game of semantics, but I believe the nuances are important."
"Gaza is not Palestine. It's the right of Palestinians to resist the occupation. It's like saying Kiev isn't occupied, why are people from Kiev fighting Russia? 

Read my comment about the recent bombing of said crossing. That's the price of egypt not listening to Israel."
"A family lost 19 members of their family yesterday in an Israeli air strike because they thought they were safe (the ""knock"" was several hundred miles away).

They are inconsistent with their usage and its still a war crime FYI. As is collective punishment. 

If you want to see terrorism, google ""Israel white phosphorous"" or ""Gaza peaceful March 2018"".

Doesn't change anything but I think it's interesting that when similar atrocities are perpetuated by Israel it gets zero media attention. If not for human rights watch and the UN there would be virtually no record of the atrocities they have committed (and still are today)

Whether Bibi's fascistic regime or Hamas, there's plenty of blame to go around."
"Agreed. I wouldn't ever defend those actions, but 600 or whatever number of violent extremists going on a rampage does not justify the indiscriminate bombing of 2.2 million people."
"I agree on that, you also think IDF soldiers are subhuman, FYI."
"Do you realize that a UN instituted legitimate government WOULDN’T want to bomb Israel? That  UN Peacekeepers would STOP them from killing each other? That, once their land is returned, and Israel isn’t keeping them locked up in the largest prison on the planet, they wouldn’t be so radicalized?"
"Yea looks like it. I think it’s easy to forget there are people in Israel who feel bad about it and they live in fear and some suffer too, though obviously overall have it much better than those in Palestine. Many Israeli’s were born there too, it’s their only home, and they’ve always know the threats and air attacks. 

I guess what I feel is a lot of fear of what people in Palestine will do, well not most of the people, but those who are filled with hate. 

Also I am sorry I kind of freaked out when I misunderstood what you were saying. Thinking you had said Hamas was the only right answer just had me going a bit ape. But I get what you said, and it was actually more grammatically correct as you meant it. Hope that doesn’t mean I was looking for trouble.

Anyway it is good to hear that when someone says they’re anti-Israel it doesn’t just mean they blame the whole country and its people for everything happening, more it’s about the situation and what the government has done. 

I feel like the whole world is a mess right now. Are you old enough to remember that Coca Cola commercial from the 70s that went “I’d like to teach the world to sing …” Thinking of the rosy outlook I had as a child, hearing things like that, and how it wasn’t so good for so many people. But growing up just wanting and assuming the best for and of everyone. How did it ever get to this?"

Also I am sorry I kind of freaked out when I misunderstood what you were saying. Thinking you had said Hamas was the only right answer just had me going a bit ape. But I get what you said, and it was actually more grammatically correct as you meant it. Hope that doesn’t mean I was looking for trouble.

Anyway it is good to hear that when someone says they’re anti-Israel it doesn’t just mean they blame the whole country and its people for everything happening, more it’s about the situation and what the government has done. 

I feel like the whole world is a mess right now. Are you old enough to remember that Coca Cola commercial from the 70s that went “I’d like to teach the world to sing …” Thinking of the rosy outlook I had as a child, hearing things like that, and how it wasn’t so good for so many people. But growing up just wanting and assuming the best for and of everyone. How did it ever get to this?"
"If they aren't representative of Palestine, why wouldn't one or more of influential palestinian groups around the world stand up to condemn the attacks and call for a peaceful resolution?

All I hear is: ""yeah, it sucks that hundreds of civilians got massacred, but..."""
"Lmao Israel tried several times.

Hamas"" attack came at the same time Israel and Saudi were establishing new peaceful deals.

Coincidence? No.

Hamas doesn't want peace, they never have. This is why they constantly reject it."
I’m not sure what that means. You’re saying a response to the brutality of the events is peace?
"No , i didnt say it was the first act of agression , it is however an escalation . Of course it was gonna get a aggresive response . Any idiot could see that . Hamas gives no fuck about people on either side . Isreal give no fuck about civilian casualties when going for retribution . You would have to be an idiot to want to live anywhere near a hamas hidout or op centre . I feel for the civilians , but if ya want to live ya better stay back . If you can thats the reality forced upon the civilians . Helped along by the hamas attack . Also . Im not your guy."
"it is not indiscriminate.

Hamas uses the general populace as human shields. which is to say, they shoot rockets at israel from residential neighborhoods, their headquarters is under a hospital, they have used medical clinics, UN schools, and mosques to store weapons.

under international law, hamas has made these locations legitimate military targets. 

your anger should be directed towards hamas."
[removed]
"They are hardly going to bomb every person in Gaza and it will never be indiscriminate bombing. In actual fact, they take much, much more care to try not to kill civilians(yes, they will end up killing civilians). The other side deliberately targets civilians. 
 hamas has indiscriminately bombed 10 million people with rockets"
Nope. IDF soldiers that have murdered/raped aren’t celebrated in the streets of Tel Aviv. Unlike the subhuman Hamas.
"It’s cute that you think they wouldn’t just because the UN “doesn’t want them to” 

Bro it’s happened so many times over the years. Why would they stop if they because a MUCH bigger power? It would happen more"
"Yeah I agree wholeheartedly. Israelis shouldn’t have to deal with unjust hate either in my opinion they have an evil government and people being born into decades long conflicts isn’t their fault either. All of those people should be living normal lives like me for example here in Canada where my biggest problem is like school debt lol. 

The hate that’s in Israel and Palestine has been a feedback loop for decades at this point all we can hope is that a peaceful outcome is achieved. 

No hard feelings it’s really easy to get emotional I mean I did as well so you’re all good with me :)

Not old enough to remember that, but I completely know what you mean regardless. I really hope that over our lifetimes we can see this meaningless bloodshed end and everyone could just live their lives and have fun! I’m glad we could end this on a good note though wish you the best!"
"All I hear from you is “yeah sucks that hundreds of civilians got massacred, now let’s go massacre them back” 
 
Here I’ll give you a chance to explain yourself I’ve proposed a solution multiple times and made myself clear, but I want to hear what you think. Please go ahead it will tell me everything I need to know. I encourage you to not be a coward and don’t hold back. How would you “deal” with the situation in Israel?"
Well then they should properly secure their borders instead of causing more bloodshed.
">I’m not sure what that means. You’re saying a response to the brutality of the events is peace?

Of course.

No one wants war."
"I agree with almost all of what you said, with some corrections.

The IDF under Bibi has been ramping up ethnic cleansing and forced displacement. Many Israeli sources have described that the border with Gaza was undefended because Bibi had pushed more troops into the west bank to murder and displace innocent civilians. Palestinian children and journalists were murdered by the IDF this year, unprovoked. Again, this conflict predates Saturday."
"They turned off water power and food to Palestine. Collective punishment is a war crime FYI. As is shooting journalists and doctors, as is using white phosphorus (on civilians, aid workers, and journalists no less). The IDF has plenty of innocent blood on their hands."
"They aren't Nazis. They are an angry and oppressed people trying to advocate for themselves. It will it inevitably come out messy and painful for all involved. This is human nature. 

Again I ask why are 2.2 million people in this situation? Why are they fighting? 

By many measures the Gaza strip.is the most densely populated and poorest region in the world. [from the UN](https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/a75d310_en_1.pdf)

It's really ironic that a Jewish Zionist would advocate for the indiscriminate erasure of a people.... I highly doubt 2.2 million people are insane zealots that want to kill everyone vs people who just want to live good lives."
The IDF regularly targets civilians FYI: https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/06/13/israel-apparent-war-crimes-gaza
That is frankly a very naive thought that betrays your ignorance.
Thanks all the best to you too!
">All I hear from you is “yeah sucks that hundreds of civilians got massacred, now let’s go massacre them back""

Could you point me to where I said that? Stop projecting your fantasies on me, it's unbecoming.

This is situation that CANNOT be dealt with by more bloodshed. You can't just displace a nation of 10 million either, no matter how much it would please the palestinians. So yeah, it's time to stop fighting and start finding a solution that's acceptable to both parties (like Israel and the UN have proposed multiple times).

The only thing that's stopping it from a peaceful resolution is Hamas, which gets tons of foreign support and financing. They the use that funding to buy weapons and indoctrinate little kids that their only reason for existence is to kill as many jews as possible.

Remove them and there will be no need to fight."
🤣🤣🤣🤣🥰
I’m curious where you are from and what your background is. With that response I’d guess western first world. Probably a suburb somewhere.
Yeah Bibi suck imo.
"none of your points actually refute anything I said. 

remind me, who is the group that governs gaza?  Is it Hamas? Yes, I think it is. 

they are responsible for providing water/power/food, not Israel. 

the collective punishment lie again?   This is not collective punishment, this is israel stopping to supply charity to gaza. giving charity, especially to an entity that wants to kill you  is not a requirement, and actually stupid. In this case, charity which frees up hamas time and resources to attack israel. if you stop giving charity to the local hospital, is that also collective punishment, you are harming all those patients, right? 

try providing aid to the enemy in a time of war and let me know from prison how it worked out. 

not to mention, that hamas is an internationally recognized terrorist organization and nobody should be supporting them.   

as a thought experiment, try sending hamas a donation. How does the government respond to your support of terrorists."
Yes when hamas runs and hides in the civilian population and even then when they are targeting that building they still take into account civilians.
"I know, fucking paragliders man."
"Who cares?

There is plenty of Israeli media with the same point of view."
Theocratic fasictic regimes are fucking terrible and have untold blood on their hands. As long as Hamas and leaders like Bibi are around this will never end.
"Lmao it's an open air prison. They arent providing these things out of the kindness of their hearts, they have evicted them from arable land, routinely displaced, harassed and murdered innocent Palestinians. That's like saying ""the Canadian government is under no responsibility to feed its prisoners!""

Actually they are."
"They aren't. Two wrongs don't make a right though right? Intentionally targeting civilians or being callously cavalier about human suffering is bad, regardless of who perpetuates it. I'm sure we agree on that much. Hamas and fascistic theological regimes can get fucked."
Who said who cares?
I sure cant see it ending . Good thing kusher fixed the middle east tho. Lol
Callously cavalier is not accurate at all. We do agree hamas and anybody who supports them can get fucked
"Big ""Mission Accomplished"" vibes."
Reckless/intentional whatever you want to call it. It's ghoulish and a war crime.
"Is anyone really surprised by this , the history books tell us that. But you can hope."
"I'm not surprised, and share that opinion. Any sort of lasting peace requires trust and there's pretty much none left to go around. Both sides are led by people that see it as a zero-sum game, it take leadership changes on both sides for there to be any sort of reconciliation but even then with the current events I don't see it being possible anytime soon. There's generations of anger and a body count of thousands just from the last week, and that's going to be near impossible to overcome.

At this point I think any possibility of a two state solution is dead. I'd be thrilled to be wrong though."
"I don't think lasting peace is possible with humans as a whole. As a species, we're woefully immature."

Other than that leave the arguing to the experts."
"I grew up in the Middle East and can confirm. They're both fighting for an ideology and that never ends peacefully.

"I think as long as religion is part of the equation, No."
"The region was doomed from the beginning. The whole situation is complicated even for historians who have followed all the events over the decades. 

And now after all of this, I cannot imagine a future where there is peace in that region or between the two communities around the world. The number of people dead, the devastation is just horrible. It's going to echo through generations."

No shit
Hard to be peaceful when your country is getting annexed literally right out from under you and every one is too scared to call out Israel’s shitty foreign policy.
Who cares what random Canadians think about a war on the other side of the planet? Surely there are people who actually know what they are talking about who can add a more informed opinion?
"As long as Hamas is involved, there's never gonna be peace."
They used to say the same thing for Ireland. Now Sinn Fein is a governing party. There is a way out but given the asymmetry of power it will have the be from the Israelis ending apartheid.
"Ok lets say for some magic reason, both sides let all the wrongs against eachother of the past go, and agreed to come to an agreement.   


First problem? The place the Palestinians and the Muslims get so up in arms about, the Dome of the Rock, is the 3rd most important site in Islam....and its built on the ruins of the Jewish Second Temple, the most important site in Judaism.   


So...in order to co-exist forever, either the Palestinians would have to forfeit their shrine to demolition, or the Jews would have to live in their homeland without ever completing the final step of living there, which is the rebuilding of the temple.   


Its kind of a non negotiable stance for either side."
It’s not possible with the level of support Israel gets and the outrage when Anyone suggests anything where they are not fully supported.  They want to genocide the Muslim’s. Unless they can fully integrate into Israel society. But they will still be treated as second class anyway.  They learned nothing from WW2 except that it’s a good idea as long as it’s not directed to them. This is not all Israeli of course many many are decent. But those in power and those who influence power are not.
"First things first before anything else can happen , Hamas has to be removed , then the innocent Palestinian people may have a fighting chance. If that happens , Israel has some serious decisions to make , removing the blockades if Hamas is removed would be a big first step. A two state solution is a long way off , but you have to believe it can happen. We can’t let history dictate the future, we shall see."
"One side has stated unequivocally that their end goal is the death of all Jews.

How do you find a peaceful solution with that line in the sand?"
Peace will only be possible when the palestinians love their children more than they hate the Jews

Both sides hate each other to death and will do anything to kill as many on the other side…"

I wish the parties could see how beatiful the last option is and stop trying futal options 1 and 2"
"When the Arab world reaches the same level of rule of law, democracy and human development as Israel, peace will directly follow."

"[Netanyahu: Money to Hamas part of strategy to keep Palestinians divided

I mean.. certainly not with the West arming the *shit* out of one side...
Israel does not want peace. It wants the land. It has created and exacerbated conflict for precisely this purpose since the day it was declared a State. All of its leaders have said so.

As long as any sort of governing authority over Palestine will not even recognize Israel’s right to exist peace will not be possible.
It’s possible if one of them wipes out the other
75 years later…little hope it’s going to turn around now! Especially when one group puts another into a concentration camp and controls every aspect of their lives including which streets they are allowed to be on.
"israel is there to create more hamas…
unless they can exterminate all palestinians this time."
"They would be correct in that. I know the lions share of responsibility for the recent attacks is being put on Hamas, the entire leadership of the Palestinian cause going back to Yasser Arafat shares this blame. 

I hope the Netanyahu government has the fortitude to resist Joe Biden’s attempts to interfere in service of ~~Obama’s~~ his vision for opening up Iran to the global economy and does what is necessary: a ground invasion and temporary occupation of Gaza with the goal of detaining/killing everyone in the Hamas chain of command."
"The land needs to be split half equally.  Land and water access.  Build a wall.  

Dont associate with each other. 

Maybe one day in the future... there will be peace. But right now.... there needs to be separation.

There is no other way.  

I dont care what the excuse is. Or historical content. Divide it and stop with the conflict."
The leadership on both sides are religious extremists. I'm not sure how they will ever be able to reconcile their differences and achieve peace unless cooler heads prevail.
You can’t prepare for peace and war at the same time
"Anything is possible. A lot of nations with long histories of animosity have adopted friendly relationships, it just takes time (sometimes generations) and effort on both fronts, a lot of it. 

That being said I don't know that the people born and raised in Gaza will ever agree with peace, all they know is the inside of their prison and are raised on stories of how their people use to live anywhere they wanted on the land until the Jews came and kicked them out of their homes. 

And based on a bunch of polls from Israel it looks like half of Israelis would never want to share the land with Arabs let alone Palestinian Arabs. But hey, it suggests that roughly half would, and that's probably the most positive start for some kind of peace in the future. Then again, it takes two people to make peace. 

I can't imagine a two state solution working unless it was re-divided 50/50 and even then, I doubt it would work. 

A single, secular nation, made up of an equal government of Palestinian Arabs and Israeli Jews, is probably the only long term solution. Good luck convincing either side of that though."
"Not possible unless one of the sides ultimately prevails with their genocide. Or a third party like the UN or USA forcefully steps in, but that is even less likely."

">Both sides are led by people that see it as a zero-sum game

Who also benefit greatly, financially and politically, from the conflict.  EVERY leader EVER benefits immensely from a boogeyman. If the Palestinians were granted Statehood tomorrow, and given 49/49/2 power sharing, with 2% going to the UN, or a neutral country like Switzerland or Iceland, in the entire area known as Israel, including the Palestinian territories, Hamas, Al Aqsa, Islamic Jihad, PLO, PLA, etc...they lose their boogeyman. They lose A LOT of money from the population that they can easily extort.  

The various Israeli leaders like Bibi cannot exploit fears and doubts, and champion nationalism and distract HIS voter-base from HIS corrupt antics.  Not to mention, I'm willing to bet, by the aggressive nature of these Jewish Settlers, there's real estate deals there.  Money flows uphill. BiBi 100% gets kickbacks from Jewish groups nationally and internationally for ""defending Jewish heritage"", blah blah blah.

>At this point I think any possibility of a two state solution is dead. I'd be thrilled to be wrong though.

According to Arab Israelis, the land is theirs AS MUCH as it is a Jewish Israelis.  The issue is, in the 40s, and subsequent decades, Jewish settlers kicked people out of their homes, and off their land.  

Imagine an American today of Dutch lineage going back 200 years, going to the Netherlands today kicking a Dutch farmer off their land, claiming ancestral rights? That's what's been happening for the past 70 years. Then, when the Palestinians took arms against these intruders, they were terrorised.  They appealed to the UN, who said, ""have some sympathy.  They just survived a holocaust"", then ignored the problem, or outright enabled the Jewish Settlers by supplying the Israeli government with tanks, jets, and the latest military hardware. 

A 2-state solution means acknowledging that Jewish Settlers ""belong there"" on land THEY stole. Oh, here's the payoff, ""we stop dropping bombs on you, and we'll keep stealing your land"". 

The Palestinians need formal agreements that have teeth, and that will NEVER happen. Because, the Israeli government will NEVER be held accountable  by ANY European/UN/NATO organization.  There has not ONCE been ANY financial, or economic sanction against Israel for its crimes against humanity.  Not one. And as long as the world ignores Israel's violations, the Arab-Israelis and Palestinians aren't incentivized to sign any agreement. 

If the US/NATO/other group went into Israel and formally charged and imprisoned Israeli defense force commanders for war crimes, not just sergeants and corporals, but Generals as well, THEN Arabs might begin to trust the agreements. Until that happen, those papers are just shit tickets."
"Conflict is inherent to life and humanity, there’s no maturing out of it unfortunately."
"It’s a manufactured conflict and there are parties on all sides which benefit from keeping this one alive. So unless the whole world agrees on a solution, which is never gonna happen, this conflict won’t get resolved."

"A big reason why Europe isn't at each other's throats is because the United States provides military protection for the entirety of Europe through NATO.

Otherwise each country would be arming themselves in self defense because they each fear their neighbor's military strength.  The resulting security competition among nations would ultimately culminate in a war.  This has happened multiple times in history already.

For Israel and Palestine to pull off the same kind of peace Europe did they'd each have to put their trust in a third regional or global hegemon to provide a security guarantee for the region."
"While they're ruling, they can rectify the Romans original mistake and rename Palestine back to Judea."
"Hadrian had something to do with that, and the solution would not go over well today. You can't wipe out a resistance movement and enslave all the survivors these days."

"That there really isn't lasting peace in the middle east.

And the Israel/Palestinian problem is so much more than just a turf war."
What history actually tells us is that the future is unknowable and we shouldn't make long-term predictions like this.
"> Personally I don’t know what the right solution is, but in the past (USA, South Africa), reintegration seems to have worked best to resolve an apartheid situation.

Have you seen how things are going in south Africa these days?"
South Africa is bordering on the edge of becoming a failed state. Are you kidding?
"> resolve an apartheid situation.

Good thing there's no apartheid in Israel where 20% of the citizen population is Arab and they enjoy full and equal rights."
"I disagree. Racial tensions still exist in both, and both involved sides that didn't have ancestral claims (im not saying we need a 2 state solution in the US just clarifying). This situation is very different and allowing each side to be in charge of theur destiny is probably best rather then having either side rule over the other.

Won't happen as it would involve concessions by all but.. Thats my overly simplistic take."
got anymore propaganda there chief?
"Capitalism is the dominant economic system in the world. It’s fuelled by literal conflict between nation states, and over extractive resources."
And they are both rejecting taking in any gazan refugees precisely to avoid taking in their problems.
"What happened to the Egyptian president that normalized relations with Israel? 

That ought to tell you what other Arab nations think about normalizing relations with Israel."
Except Israeli tourist shit by police officer yup normal relations
This is just wrong. Muslims and Jews live in peace literally all over the world. This is just propaganda used to prop up ghettoizing ethnic minorities and to justify the current genocide. The chance of an Israeli genocide is nil and the genocide of Palestinians is happening literally right now.
That’s why a two state solution is best.

"Sure, they lived somewhat peaceful in the Ancient Kingdom of Israel, Judea and Samaria. That is until the Romans came and enslaved a million Jews and destroyed the Temple. Oh and then when the Muslim conquest occurred about 1400 years ago and Jews were than dhimmi's until the Ottoman Empire was dismantled. ""Peaceful"""
"That was a 19th century idea when discrimination wasn't a bad thing.

Imagine calling France, UK or US a Christian country and then see what it does to the laws banning discrimination based on religion, race, ethnicity, etc."
"seriously, peace has been on the table many times and each time palestine rejected it because they want it all, and all jews gone from israel too. their only diffrence in discourse was if they wanted them gone via deportation or through genocide"
There seems to be a common denominator in most world conflicts… 🤔
"This is such an oversimplification.

You were quite literally a second or third tier citizen in the Ottoman Empire if you weren’t Muslim. If you converted to Islam, the avenues open to you were enormous, in order to pressure the local populace to convert en masse.

You weren’t divided by ethnic lines in the Ottoman Empire at all, it was strictly by religion.

So many grand Viziers / sultans were or Albanian, Armenian, Greek, Bosnian descent etc. An avenue open to citizens of the empire if they converted to Islam and assimilated into being an Turk.

If not, well, second / third class citizen for you where you get to enjoy extra taxation, no legal representation against Muslims (a Christian or Jew had the law stacked against them if they were ever up against a Muslim. A Muslim man stole all your money and raped your wife? Well the court is gonna side with him because you’re not a Muslim. A Muslim accuses you of stealing his families ancestral land? Expulsion for you, etc).

And let’s not even get into the whole jannisary system  or how they selected women for the harem.

So it was “peaceful” in a sense that Jews and Christians were violently suppressed into obedience / subservience. They did not have the means to rise up for centuries, which they always wanted to do because you got zero representation in Ottoman affairs since you were a vassal of infidels.

“Liberation” from the empire always came from the sword. The ottoman response was mass slaughter and rape, even when they were retreating. Since who cares, it was to infidels right? 

Not a bad time to be alive if you forcibly converted for your you and your families protection though."

Why does white matter? Israelite and Palestenians are not that different racially. Especially after 50 years of occupying the same place
">Israel and Palestine are very religious and both hate each other on the extreme ends of those religious views.

Palestine welcomed Jews into Palestine when they were fleeing. There was no hating each other back then.

One side calls for justice and has extremists who use terrorism in reaction to oppression the majority however are folks hoping for a two state solution. 

The other  side calls for collective punishment, genocide, ethnic cleansing and the immediate cancelling of anyone referring to the nakba or any war crimes etc.... and has the tens of billions in funding and armaments to do as they please..."

Long ago when the UN drafted a right of return for Palestinians, they sent a count Bernadotte to Israel to oversee the UN mandate. He was assassinated by a Jewish terrorist organization. One of the men who ordered the killing of the Swiss UN delegate eventually became prime minister, though his involvement was only discovered later.

Even if the majority on both sides wanted peace and coexistence, it only takes a radical few willing to go to any means to stop it from happening."

That was an incredibly well thought-out response.  Thank you.
"I couldn’t agree more. I think the best examples are when the greedy capitalist USSR invaded Poland and split it with N*zis.

"Yes. E.g. the Yazidis, who are very hard to find now that ISIS slaughtered nearly every last one of them. There were also 800,000 Jews who had to flee the Arab countries after 1948 when laws started to be passed saying a Jew can't use a telephone, a Jew can't own property, etc.

And even other Muslims are oppressed, such as the Ahmadiyya and Sufis. Even the Sunni and Shiites like bombing each other's mosques."
People seem to have a hard time grasping that the Levant and North Africa was Arabized through colonization.

I just meant that the countries mentioned were white countries run by white leaders. Generally that does have an aspect, even if it's a small one - although back in the day it was MUCH larger of an issue.

The main issue is religion. That region has been a battle zone for religion for the past 2000 years."

You think arabs wanting to kill Jews dates back to only to the founding of Israel?
Yes because all of Israel's neighbors totally weren't trying to wipe it out before. Such a stupid take.
"Dude if Israel wanted to kill all Palestinians they'd be dead already. Now if Palestine had the ability to kill all Jews, then they'd also be dead. Big difference. Israel has a ton of restraint. Also, it's actually Palestinian children being taught to hate Israel and join Hamas. Educate yourself."

They were settled there during British rule of the region.  Basically Europeans took in Palestinian refugees.  Why isn’t the current Muslim leadership doing the same?

"That's not even a problem, successful cultures spread and conquer. We just shouldn't do that anymore. The problem is that, we should NOT do that, and also make everyone full equal citizens of a polity, enfranchise everyone, and manage things so that disparity and opportunity are more shared... But that isn't the end goal of the peaceful religion, it's goals are diametrically opposed to that vision. You cannot undo history but you can work towards a better future."

">Hamas wouldn’t exist outside of random basements if the Palestinians were reintegrated into Israeli society and the Knesset abolished apartheid laws, lol.

This is what people thought about the ANC as well, which spent much of their existence acting as terrorists, bombing things, setting people on fire with gasoline-filled tires around them, etc.

Now I understand, you think the Palestinians are in a “concentration camp” and in your view how people in a concentration camp fight back isn’t up for criticism.

Ergo you think that Hamas attack inside of Israel is not up for criticism or condemnation?"
Arab muslims have been killing Jews in the Middle East since 624..
Gaza has not been under Israeli control for 15 years
"Arab citizens inside Israel over half of whom are Muslims- vote, run for office, and have organized political parties. As a fifth of the population, they enjoy more security, prosperity, and freedom than do their counterparts in the surrounding Arab nations.

In contrast, can one envision non-Arab Christian or Jewish residents of Gaza voting, running for office, forming political parties, or criticizing Hamas? This projected charge of apartheid, it applies to Hamas, which considers anyone other than Arab Muslims as inferiors to be kept out of Gaza."
So how do you stop Palestinians from killing or expelling Jews?
no it really hasnt changed much imo
"All you are really trying to do is bring up whataboutisms related to socialism rather than actually refuting the original point. The all-too-common kind of reply on Reddit when someone dares critiques capitalism.

“Socialist countries go to war too.” — do you want a pat on the back for being so brilliant? I guess it’s just a lot easier than truly questioning centuries of US imperialism around the world.

I’ll leave you with a good quote that I saw recently on Twitter from a writer/journalist named Jonathan Cook:

“Even if you have committed to a side – Israel's or the Palestinians' – you can and should stand back, every now and then, to look at the bigger picture.

There are reasons the West is continuously waging wars, or fuelling them. Think of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Ukraine, Gaza – all of them just in the last two decades. 

One is because there is *lots* of money to be made from war – or there is if you belong to the ruling class. There's money in the weapons and technology that make the fighting possible; money in the resources, largely hidden from view, that are being quietly fought over; and money in persuading you and me that we must tighten our belts to support the war effort.

But there's another reason.

If we weren't at war, if a new war wasn't always dominating the headlines and our passions, making us either outraged or fearful for the future, we would have the mental space and energy to think about other things. 

Such as how badly our societies are run, how the wealth gap just keeps growing, how incompetent our leaders seem, and how little is being done to solve the biggest problems facing us, like ecological collapse. 

If we weren't so convinced that we are the good guys, if we weren't so eager to cheerlead another war, we might start to understand that we are all the same, that we share one planet, that our future hangs on cooperation not conflagration.

Which is precisely why we will always be at war.”"
"Unprovoked, eh?

Enough.  This conversation is pointless."

Gaza is not a sovereign territory either.  Almost nothing gets in or out without the permission of Israel.  Saying that Gaza is not under Israeli control is like saying KwaZulu was not under the control of apartheid South Africa.
"Listen mate, Hamas isn't the bar you want to tout being able to clear. And none of what you've said addresses the initial point which was that non-Jewish citizens don't have the same extent of rights that Jewish citizens do.

They don't call themselves the Jewish State for no reason"
"You can't compare it to Gaza, most people wouldn't last in that prison even if they had the right skin colour or religion. The west bank would be a more apt comparison, and they are by no means equal. They are tolerated, and they have rights, but they're certainly not equal."
The same way you stop Jews from killing and kidnapping Palestinians I would guess?
"Who fired the rockets first?

The general argument is that Zionism is evil because it is a colonizing force.

If colonizing is evil and bad, it should be so for anyone who engages in it no?"
The Gaza-Egypt border could be the Arab Schengen area but Egypt has their own reservations about Gaza
Why on earth would Israel open their borders to a 'country' that openly wants to wipe them off the face of the planet? Also you conveniently leave out Egypt who also shares a border with Gaza.

If you're referencing the Arab conquests, are we really going to hold modern day Palestinians accountable for something that happened in the 7th century?"

"When the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem got together for a romantic get-away with playboy Hitler as a means of finding a final solution for the Mizrahi Jews (well BEFORE the creation of Israel), this is because he was able to predict how evil Israel would be one day.

I'm sure the entire world has been waiting for Olivia Chow to tell them what to do.
She can’t even secure a ceasefire on Yonge and Dundas.
"> Speaking at city hall, Chow avoided getting into the specifics of what a ceasefire and hostage release in the Middle East would look like.

>“That’s up to our government to negotiate — I’m not a foreign affairs minister, I have no experience in that kind of (thing), I’m a local mayor,” she said.

Good that she recognizes the meaninglessness of her statement, and the rallies’ calls on her to make one. Maybe it will help placate the mob, but she’s right: she’s a local mayor."
What does a Canadian mayor have anything to do with a global conflict?
">In her statement, Chow called for both the release of hostages held by Hamas and a ceasefire in the region.

>“I believe that peace can only come through the immediate and unconditional return of all hostages and a ceasefire, as has been called for by humanitarian organizations, including the United Nations,” her statement said.

I don't know why everyone is getting bent out of shape, this is a pretty even keel take.

And if she said nothing, the news would print some nonsense about supporting violence through silence instead.  Lose-lose for anyone with an audience. 

Humans are rapidly devolving back to monke I think."
"""Release of hostages"" is so triggering to the anti-Israili protesters.  She stands to lose quite a bit of support with that comment."
I'm sure Hamas will respect a ceasefire...
"""Okay, we will ceasefire because the mayor of Toronto told us so"""
Hamas already broke the cease fire--- that's how they got into this mess.
"Every ceasefire has ended with a Hamas terrorist attack. Hamas is not letting civilians leave Gaza city and keeps stationing military points in schools and hospitals. While there is always civilian casualties in war, the vast majority of the ones in this conflict are the result of Hamas breaking human rights rules. This almost seems like it's intentionally being left out of some media stuff"
Call for Hamas to surrender!
"Alright everyone, the war will be over now!"

"Imagine asking the U.S. to use caution and have temporary ""cease fires"" after 9/11. Israel is already using more restrained than the U.S. ever did."
"Thank god, everyone knows the middle east really needs Toronto's input on their situations. 

What a hero."
"Yeah ok , can you fix the TTC , crime in the city ? 
Do your job and focus on the problems in Toronto."
I'm sure they're listening now.
Wtf kind of away does a city Mayor have on international politics - stay in your swimlane and focus on your own mandate.
"Oh, finally somebody thought on their lunch hour to stop the violence and release the hostages.

Good job!"
She probably should focus on getting a ceasefire in Toronto first
a few billion voices more and we can make a change!
"She's the mayor of Toronto, why is this even a headline?"
"I loathe this public jerking off from all these people with no skin in the game.

Every time something happens they gotta wade in and say their bit."
"Olivia, you are only a mayor of Toronto. Get over yourself."
"FINALLY!!! Someone important and with some actual power is calling for a ceasefire. That's it boys, war's over, Toronto's mayor wants it so."
"The Toronto mayor has spoken Hamas and Israel.

Now the conflict is SOLVED!"
A ceasefire sounds great if both sides would abide. But that’s not the case.
That'll get their attention!
"I call for a release of hostages, Hamas to step down, an apology, full democracy, an end to anti semitism, and a full apology.

It won’t happen, but I call for it. Therefore I did “something”"
The venerable city-state of Toronto pipes up with their $0.02 worth. 🤷‍♂️
Did it work? Did they stop?
So they'll listen to her. 🙄
"This thread is full of people that literally can't shut up about the war in Gaza wondering why someone else is talking about the war in Gaza, fucking incredible."
She's a fucking mayor... who cares what she has to say on international affaires...
There was a ceasefire on Oct 6th
"Oh man, that’ll definitely put an end to decades of violence. /s

Has anyone asked Ken Bone what he thinks?"
"Netanyahu and the gang will definitely be listening to this one!
Chow is such a hero."
"If she doesn't know what a ceasefire would look like, then why did she call for it? Would it just make sense that you don't call for things you don't understand.
I used to be a liberal voter, but they have lost my votes for the foreseeable future, at all government levels."
"Doctors without borders Canada are reporting have no electricity in a hospital with:

600 patients 

37-40 premature babies in incubators (two have tragically passed away) 

17 patients in ICU 

We are witnessing hospitals turn into graveyards due to Israeli's cruel and inhumane siege.

Shameful day for Canada if we cannot call for a ceasefire at the federal level 

I could only imagine our response if Russia was doing this.

Edit: I'm ashamed to read some of these comments by fellow Canadians. We really do live in a wicked world with sick people."
This is such an uncontroversial statement that all political leaders should make.
Finally. No doubt the fighting will stop now that the mayor of Toronto has requested it. Why didn't we think of this before?
I also demand a ceasefire. Where is my news article? /s because apparently the average redditor is too socially inept to detect sarcasm
"the most neutral take possible, a giant chunk of people call this pro terrorist though."
"I agree, Hamas should release the hostages and surrender while seeking a ceasefire.   White flags boys...white flags.  

Oliva, read your Clausewitz, there is a goal here.   Peaceful co-existence with Hamas gets in the way of the goal."
"Wow, it's over, Hamas is getting right on it I expect."
Well that settles it. Should wrap up anytime now.
Great job problem solved
Has Ja rule said anything yet? that's the real question
"Why a cease fire, hamas wants a perpetual war. Let them have the chance to explain their actions to their God."
How has that worked out so far? 🙄
"Mr Netanyahu sir, I bring word from the new world ! It says the mayor of Toronto wants a ceasefire! 
My goodness Ephraim! Quick get Mahmoud on the phone !"
"When Owivia Chow calls for cease fire, the Jews and Palestinians listen."
Politicians are so funny.
"Olivia.   

Even Toronto doesn't care what you think."
"it is pretty disgusting that this turned this into a partisan issue.  Particularly from the left tbh and I say that as one who leans left. 

The only concern a Toronto mayor should have is controlling the ridiculous and pointless protests. What the fuck does Olivia Chow or any other political figure including the prime minister think they will accomplish with coming out with these stances aside from enabling these increasingly violent and disruptive protests."
That oughta do it.
"Ok, they’re going to listen now!!"
You got the order wrong there Ollie
"    With all due respect, would you kindly stay in your lane Ms. Chow."
How did this end up as mayor?  Toronto is filled with idiots.
"Everyone must feel so good now. Thanks Chow, I’ll be able to sleep tonight."
[removed]
Everyone knock it off! The mayor of a city in Canada said so.
"Thank you, Olivia."
OK. what would anyone listen to her?
Grifter yells at clouds. More news at 11.
"Yup, pack it up! The mayor of toronto has spoken!"
and her PS was: can we get some global handouts for Toronto so she does not have to raise taxes!
She’s going to use her strong-mayor powers to get it done!
"Hearing from insiders that Chow’s calls have made it to the front lines, and men have begun dropping their weapons!

/s lmao"
Wouldn’t shock me if Jyoti did this too.
You people know squat about her policies and calling a truce is bad?.Come on at least try to hide a bit of your racism .
What an antisemite
Easier said than done
"If Joly can't make anything happen, what is Chow able to do? I'm curious"
"Yeah, me too."
"Glad at least she is also calling for a return of the hostages, something most people calling for a ceasefire are happily ignoring"
"""Cease fire"" talks justifies Hamas as a government of a legit soverign country, right?"
Thanks Olivia…great job
Ok good. This is rock solid and not just useless nonsense
Yes because hamas listens to Olivia in some country named Canada 🙄
"Olivia Chow to suit up and peace keep the middle east.

""Fine, I'll do it myself!"". She says as.she jumps out of a C130"
I’m not surprised this wars going on still… Dude hasn’t said a word yet.
wish I could upvote more than once! This really does encapsulate the absurdity.
I heard Dennis Rodmans on the way there now
"Haha, underrated comment"
"Not as of yet, but the comedian Patton Oswalt said that it's clear as day that the worst part of this Hamas-Israel conflict is the hypocrisy."
Yeah I spoke to him yesterday. Had to send him a Google maps link to show him where Gaza was.
Whats Ja think at a time like this!
My fucking lord this comment made me tear up laughing..  you win the internet today! Thank you..
"😂😂😂😂
Who gives a fuck what Ja Rule (Olivia Chow) thinks at a time like this, this is ridiculous! I want some answers that Ja Rule (Olivia Chow) might not have right now."

"""Ahmed! Ahmed! Stop shooting! Olivia Chow wants ceasefire.""

""What? Who??""

""OLIVIA.  CHOW."""
At least she took the shooting and kidnapping is bad stance. Seems easy enough but the last month has been crazy.
Let's start with a ceasefire in Toronto. Fighting between protesters is a bad look for a society that prides itself on free speech.
">I'm sure the entire world has been waiting for Olivia Chow to tell them what to 

No, this is an attempt to cool the unrest and antisemitic violence happening in Montreal right now.  


Do not confuse statements like this being for anything but domestic consumption."
"One thread I see people say the left is supporting Hamas by not calling for the release of the hostages, and the next I see someone saying “who cares?” when someone calls for the release of hostages.  This whole situation is the most ridiculous shitshow."
Hasn't she got a housing crisis to tend to... or is that all taken care of ?
Honestly it’s a Canadian politician saying what Trudeau is afraid to say. It may not get international recognition but it may gain traction for politicians across Canada.
You realize she has constituents that have a connection to this and would appreciate a statement? I’m pretty confident she doesn’t think she will influence peace talks.
"The smooth brained takes always make it to the top. She's obviously making a statement because select constituents are continuously demanding more Israel - Palestine takes from her. This is a peer pressure thing, no one including herself thinks that Hamas knows she exists."
why are people in Canada so delusional they think that something they say here will make any impact half way across the world?
"The more the world catches on to this, the higher the pressure on Israel."
Well she is the president of Toronto!
"Well, comparing her to the other folks, now I know she aligns with my views somewhat."
Shots fired!
Damn I laughed out loud
">She can’t even secure a ceasefire on Yonge and Dundas.

Ahahahaha...it's the flavour of the month, now that remembrance day is winding down. Politicians jumping on the Israel v Hamas conflict bandwagon for personal gain

If only these politicians will put the same energy into housing and their vote against NIMBYISM"
Brutal.
"It's not up to ""our government"" to negotiate either though."
Shows a lot of these comments didn’t read the article. They are making the same jokes over and over again
"> Good that she recognizes the meaninglessness of her statement, and the rallies’ calls on her to make one.

that came after she got in shit for making a much more pro-palestinian statement initially. then walking it back and getting shit on by the more militant pro-hamas people for doing it. and after that she learned to just stay the fuck out of this as a municipal mayor

as a lifelong ndp member im sure personally she is more pro-palestinian but is also a seasoned politcian and knows when its just better to peace out"
"Ultimately nothing, yet people keep demanding she make a statement about it anyway."
"Shit, at this point, what does Canada have to do with a global conflict."
Absolutely nothing. What does a bunch of people sitting in and stopping traffic or the subway have to do with us as well?
"Nothing.  Several of her constituents have relatives in the region and they've asked her to make a statement.  ""Don't shoot civilians"" seemed benign enough to go with, so she said it publicly."
"Globally nothing. 

To the local Jewish and Arab communities? A lot."
[deleted]
We have a sizeable population of both sides in the gta. As an elected official it’s reasonable to make a statement for peace. Ignoring the conflict would draw worse  criticism
Virtue signalling.
"Chow has large ethnic communities that are voters in Toronto .  Her re election campaign started the day after her recent win as mayor.  It’s that simple.  Constant posturing. 

The words I’d like to hear from Chow are ‘we are raising property taxes in Toronto substantially, enough to cover basic operations, as every other city does’ ."
Some of her constituents in all likelihood have family directly impacted?
"There are these people called constituents and they vote in this thing called a mayoral election.

Many of those same constituents care about global affairs, particularly so a large portion who are of Israeli or Palestinian origin. They want to hear what their elected representative thinks about the issue.

I know... real mind-blowing concept!"
"Symbolic bending of the knee for Hamas enthusiasts. This is just a spectator sport  to most of the Keffiyeh-wearing crowd that turns out for the rallies. Note that the groundswell of ""Ummah"" sentiment only pops up in \*certain\* conflicts. These people don't give a shit about Darfur for example.  
No Jews no news!"
"Not much.  But sometimes it's important to make a statement, any statement, to set a position you can adjust later.  If you don't, if you remain silent, then it risks someone else setting that position for you i.e. ""Not speaking out is being complicit"".  First to publish/post is frequently the narrative that sticks, and trying to counter that requires a lot of effort that can be better spent elsewhere; not countering it will result in other potential restrictions or problems later on.

Not making a choice is still a choice, and one that can have worse outcomes than making a more definitive choice."
"It all starts somewhere.

Have you watched the cartoonish video statement by Trudeau where he continuously trips over the word “ceasefire” and tries to say pause. It’s one of his dumbest statements but Conservatives won’t jump on it because they are doing similar mental gymnastics. 

We need to normalize all government officials to call for a ceasefire so that the bizarre narrative that only evil doers are being killed by Israel is finally put to rest."
What do we have to do with a global conflict? Should we all just never say anything about it?
Everyone can have an opinion. Maybe she wants to take in all refugees next
Opportunity to virtue signal.
"Chow seizing an easy opportunity to gain a few votes from people impacted by the horrible situation in middle east. 

What’s next, Chow’s position on independence of Catalonia ?"
"Can't she say ""I'm mayor of Toronto and unless this issue impacts this city I have other issues to focus on"" ...

Guess it is too hard..."
"Apparently a bunch of the Canadian mayor's constituents are organizing protests across Toronto and that requires a response to dissipate the dissent.  


But, for the average person, i'd imagine that wouldn't be a thought that would cross someone's mind."
I wonder what the Mayor of Helsinki thought about the Canadian trucker protest.
because a ceasefire just mean hamas gets to keep lobbing rockets into israel and buildup again for another terrorist attack. then israel gas to keep spending billions countering all that. hamas needs to end
"This is not an even keel take and even keel take is Hamas' immediate and unconditional surrender.

There was a ceasefire that they broke and now everyone wants Israel to just be cool with it, which is not a reasonable ask."
"I've heard no criticism of the sort actually. She already lost their support when she called the protests in Toronto ""hate marches"" which actually brought out more people than would have originally come"
Her calling for a ceasefire is a big win for anti-Zionist protesters in Toronto who have been requesting her to do this for weeks.
Amen. Free the hostages from Hamas! Also free Palestine from Israel!
"I'm sure there are some with that mindset, but in general the protests aren't pro-hostage-taking or pro-hamas, but rather anti-murder-of-innocent-people-and-cultures."
">I'm sure Hamas will respect a ceasefire...

Don't forget Hamas likes the ""sexy older"" Canadian women, like the 3 kids 51 yr old woman from BC who went of to marry 2 x ISIS young fighters, and then begged the govt to come get her out"
They definitely won't mass murder 1000+ people again!
yea why is it never that
"She only cares about foreigners fighting for racist reasons, not Canadians who fought racists."
It's a big win for anti-Zionist protesters in Toronto who have been requesting her to call for a ceasefire for weeks.
"Nah that requires leadership and willingness to make hard decisions, let's just talk and make everyone feel good, people love it."
">somebody thought on their lunch hour to stop the violence 

You mean while they were CHOW-ING down their food?"
She's a little late to the game. Nelson from Bow Island called for a cease-fire weeks ago.
"I can’t help but laugh picturing a terrorist climbing down into the depths of the tunnels under Gaza and reporting to his commander “Sir!  Olivia Chow, the mayor of Toronto, Canada, has called for a ceasefire and the release of the hostages!”"
https://media.tenor.com/5WMD9NxHnCUAAAAC/ralph-wiggum-simpsons.gif
Centre of the universe.
"I mean, she wants the killing to stop that's all. She prefaced it with a caveat that it's not her department, so don't mince words, but she represents a large population and was called upon to say something on the matter.

Also she's not liberal. Also also, not voting for someone because they associate with others who have said they don't want people to be murdered is stupid."
"This subreddit is cancer. You won't find empathy in here, just bloodlust.

11,000 people dead. 50% of the Gaza population is children.

If Hamas was hiding in Israel instead of Gaza, would the IDF be bombing Israeli hospitals? Of course not.

Blatant disregard for the civilian population."
"Did you know that hamas seizes all the fuel from that hospital to run their own generators to supply air/power to their tunnels? Did you also know that hamas shoots everyone that tries to leave that hospital as they use it for cover? Did you know that hamas openly acknowledged that they do not care about civilians and said it's UNs job to take care of them?
Edit: FYI as of May 2023 ""WHO has verified more than 1000 attacks on health care in Ukraine since the invasion by the Russian Federation in February last year – the highest number WHO has ever recorded in any humanitarian emergency."""
"It’s pointless though because last time there was a ceasefire in place, well… You know."
">I also demand a ceasefire. Where is my news article?

Who are you again...Danielle Smith?"
Because hamas can not be allowed to exist. They've stated themselves they will repeat oct 7 attacks as often as they can
">Has Ja rule said anything yet?

Yes...he's mesmerized by it all

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcP96KbFIIU"
"in the article it says: 
> In her statement, Chow called for both the release of hostages held by Hamas and a ceasefire in the region.

... you want them to do a cease fire first, then release the hostages?  WTF is wrong with you."
"""WAR BAD""- Olivia Chow 2023.

People will be quoting her for centuries, truly our generations poet."
"Honestly this is so ridiculous. I’m sure even she thinks that. 
We gonna get a call for a cease fire in Sudan too? How about Ethiopia and Yemen? Nah not enough likes on social media to care about that"
">After her support for pro Hamas protest I totally believe that.

never happened."
">The mayor of a city in Canada said so.

We all know how Rob Ford ended up"
well he was friends with the korean dictator . . . just like one of the two-michaels.
">, but the comedian Patton Oswalt said th

normmmmm"
">you win the internet today!

Can't believe someone would say this unironicaly"
"Constitution say she ain’t got no say in this.   Foreign affairs be federal (and sometimes provincial with things like education and health accords between a province and a country).

Mayors are to stay in their lane for a reason.  If every mayor sounded off on any and all foreign affairs issues, we’d have one hell of a convoluted, incoherent mess being put forward as a country to the world."
Is that the criminal guy from Hangover?
Problem solved!
CHOW SAYS NOW!!
Allah Akbar! Olivia Chow has spoken!!
what exactly should our stance be other than this as Canadians? Like how is it good for us at all to just get behind one side killing the other?
Today i learned mayors are only allowed to perform a single task.
"She has put more programs into action sin e becoming mayor than lazy daisy tory did in his entire term.  

I was skeptical when she was elected but I'm happy stuff is being done and she's been giving ford a hard stance."
About as effective as a fart in the wind.
"It's not going to do shit. If Trudeau said the same thing, it wouldn't do shit (except possibly draw retaliation from our biggest ally, the US).

Canada has ZERO influence in this conflict. We should focus on Canadian issues, we have a cost of living crisis next time I check. And putting that further in jeopardy by causing a rift with our greatest trading partner to virtue signal while accomplishing nothing is among the dumbest of ideas I've ever heard"
"How do you know what Trudeau is afraid to say? Canada has always been on the side of Israel and said they have a right to do what they need to do to ensure their safety. Calling for a humanitarian corridor and some time for Palestinians in the north to move to the south is all that Canada will ask for. And no, Chow saying anything is not going to make anyone come out and say so too. She is of course, welcome to say whatever she wants, but thinking it will mean anything to anyone making any decisions on this matter makes no sense. Neither will any words coming from any other mayor or premier in the country."
She’s an idiot that knows she can literally say what’s popular to her large Muslim base despite every single military strategist in the world disagreeing. You don’t allow terrorists to steal your citizens then dictate terms for their release. It’s release them or we will destroy your shithole city and rescue them ourselves.
Isn’t that what he already said?
It the easy thing to say. 80 percent of canadians say a ceasefire should happen and the hostages should be released. 10 percent say just a ceasefire.
Pandering to terrorists supporters then ? I'm sure that counts for a lot of votes since we seem to have a lot of terrorist sympathizers in Canada/ GTA
"You call *me* stupid, but...

You obviously don't know there's an enormous difference between her peers and her constituents. 

Could you please point to even one instance of the people of Toronto *continously demanding* she weigh in on this? Is anyone, anywhere really sitting around getting frustrated with the lack of response from a Canadian municipal politician?

If she knows that Hamas don't even know she exists, then why would she feel it's important for her to weigh in with her opinion? This is political grandstanding, for the sole purpose of making herself look important, and makes about as much sense as the IDF commenting on the lack of affordable housing in Brampton."
"Yes, because most other Canadian politicians (or other folks as you call them) are definitely calling for more attacks from both sides, and more dead hostages."
Can confirm!
"I mean... She literally has put more energy into both those things, and multiple Toronto councillors have put energy since she took office into those things.

So I'm not entirely sure the point of your comment."
"No it’s not, nor should they be construed as having “experience in that kind of (thing)”."
"Melanie Joly has just as little say in this as Chow. We're not involved, it is most certainly not our place to ""negotiate"" anything, with the exception of the safe return of Canadian citizens to Canada."
"But we do provide resources to Israel - so we do, in fact have *some* leverage."
"Yep. Lots of jumping to conclusions based on the title. Even still, her voice is small by itself, but its one that many Canadians will hear (as is evident by this article).

Just saying ""She's just virtue signaling"", as many are doing in this thread, does nothing but diminish something important: Discussion of morality and shared values. Virtue signalling is a good thing when it's genuine.

Additionally, a lot of people need to be told what to concern themselves with, and I'd much rather our leadership be reminding them that we, as Canadians, value other people."
"> that came after she got in shit for making a much more pro-palestinian statement initially. then walking it back and getting shit on by the more militant pro-hamas people for doing it. and after that she learned to just stay the fuck out of this as a municipal mayor

Yeah that was amusing."
Yeah but where does Kevin Lee fit into this?
"Toronto is a big city with A LOT of Muslims and A LOT of Jews who have picked sides, and are expecting the mayor to choose a team, so that one side can claim moral superiority.  Neither Israel's Government or Hamas hold the moral high-ground. Pretending either of these entities do, is a fool's errand."
Toronto's virtue signalling is the best in the World.
"> We have a sizeable population of both sides in the gta.

in 2003 we did. in 2023 the muslim population of the gta dwarfs the jewish population"
You mean what you're doing right now? 😭
Israel has the right to wage war against Gaza and defend their nation against terrorism.
"The issue is impacting the city. There have been multiple large protests and hate crimes perpetrated by both sides. As the leader of one of Canada’s largest cities with a large population of Muslims and Jewish people, she has an obligation to defend peace and try to calm both sides down."
They're mostly anti-Israel protesters but still.  We know what happens when you show any support for the hostages.
">Her calling for a ceasefire is a big win for anti-Zionist protesters in Toronto 

Yes, Israel has just been waiting to hear what to do from Olivia Chow. Winning bigly."
How does she have any influence on what Israel does lol?
"*free Palestine from Hamas.

Fixed it for you."
Then why arnt they protesting hamas?

Could you tell me who ""them"" are?  This is in Canada btw."
I would like to agree but I don’t see that as the case. Nobody was protesting when Hamas stormed the music festival.
I thought a 51 year old would be about 3-4x too old for the IS folks 👀
"It's a big loss for the whole world, it's just sad and makes her seem extremely desperate for attention. There's a million other worst situations going on, she's just mentioning this to make the jewish community happy. It's called politics."
"Nor can I picture an IDF terrorist doing this but I think the point is to try and put pressure on our federal government to do something

But you guys aren’t thinking of that because it goes against your wishes regarding this conflict"
"This is not bloodlust. This is assigning blame and responsibility where it belongs. 

There is fuel in gaza for hospital generators (for now) but it’s been appropriated by Hamas to power the tunnel infrastructure including pumping air. So it’s really simple, Hamas is responsible, moreover, they were responsible in evacuating civilians before the fighting started. That’s how wars are fought"
The people dying every day don’t find it pointless.
Read the headline good sir.
I mean it could make sense. Don't want to release the hostages into an active warzone.

"As Canadians?

Can ya quit with the perforating eachother and maybe think about talking about it for a change?

Geopolitically we can't do a damn thing.  The incessant cause-consciousness does nothing to help either side and is just a way for people to peacock about a cause they can't do anything about.

Keep your stick on the ice."
">Canada has ZERO influence in this conflict. We should focus on Canadian issues

It's like your house is burning down, but you're worried about starving children in Africa.  You're an asshole if you don't care about it, but...

And yes, I anticipate a response from someone who's really really smart saying ""well actually we can care about two things at the same time"" and to them I say ""yeah obviously but the fact that this seems to get infinite attention from our news media and water cooler talk means that we just have a new form of division when we should be pissed off about CoL and how we're getting our fudge packed by our politicians, also I'm really handsome and smart, too, so maybe think about that?""

I always win the arguments I have in my head.  Heh, I'm awesome."
"Canada has a lot more influence on the international stage than you give it credit for.

Can we implement the cease fire overnight? Absolutely not but we can help turn the tide in terms of diplomatic pressure on Israel. You are already seeing western nations starting to do this like France. 

We would be best to break with the United States position or else we risk going down with a sinking ship in terms of geopolitical policy.

I recall Canada standing firm against the invasion of iraq and that proved to be the correct decision. 

Canada risks alienating a whole generation of Middle Eastern youth and being complicit in war crimes currently taking place in Gaza by the Israeli military.

Not only that, but our current diplomatic position on this conflict puts Canadians lives in danger unnecessarily globally. 

I'm not saying we need to be pro hamas or anything. We can condemn violence and atrocities as we see them unfolding. 

Canada has condemned October 7th attack as they should have, and we have affirmed Israel's right to exist and defend itself again. That was the right move. 

Not condemning this madness by the Israeli military and not demanding a ceasefire breaks with that fact finding geopolitical strategy."
"Canadian issue is that we have imported a lot of terrorist sympathizers here as ""immigrants"" just look at all the ""protests"" all these people should be arrested and deported."
"How does her statement, in any way, pander to terrorists?"
How does her statement - a call to peace - in any way pander to terrorists or their supporters?
"Protesters effectively demanded her to only give a take they want to hear. Literally 3 seconds of googling:

[Mayor Chow's post became the target of many of her follower’s disapproval, some others also took issue with her labelling the rally as “in support of Hamas.""](https://www.google.com/amp/s/ca.news.yahoo.com/amphtml/olivia-chow-mayor-palestine-israel-rally-161254626.html)

Even random celebrities are being dragged into giving a take on the topic."
I'm curious if you would have felt the same way regarding what Nazis did in WW2. Just a thought 🤷‍♂️
"Sort of off-topic, but I thought virtue signaling meant making empty statements of solidarity without any intention of taking action? Or, saying something to make yourself look appealing to a certain group of people/the popular voice without actually playing a role in finding solutions for problems? Or just saying stuff that you don't understand because you want to fit in and look good, essentially? 

Which makes sense - there is a human need for belonging. Sometimes what we say or do to belong is disingenuous/blind following, which would constitute ""virtue signaling""

That's my understanding of it, anyway. Correct me if I'm wrong!"
"Yeah because clearly people absolutely do need to be reminded that despite what some other countries values might be, WE are a liberal western secular democracy with rights and freedoms that people are allowed to use and protections for vulnerable populations that will be enforced."
"Undefeated, and never lost a round."
9.6% of the GTA population is Muslim and Canada also has 45k Palestinians. The GTA has about 190k Jews.
This was pointed out that countries with waring factions shouldn't be admitted in case they bought the fighting to Canada. But they  were labeled racist or xenophobic..
"Nonsense.

Hamas is literally shooting their own people to stop them from evacuating.

Israel clearly holds the moral high ground here regardless of your pro Hamas opinion."
">Neither Israel's Government or Hamas hold the moral high-ground. Pretending either of these entities do, is a fool's errand.

Hence why an imminent ceasefire and negotiations are necessary?"
"Actually, the military sworn to defend a democratic country clearly has the moral high ground over a terrorist organization sworn to destroy that democratic country and murder the 7 million Jews who live there.

The longstanding conflict between Israel and the Palestinians may be complicated, but *that's* not complicated at all."
lol what?
"Legally Israel not entitled to the right of self defence against territory that they have annexed.

https://www.icj-cij.org/case/131

>Lastly, the Court concluded that Israel could not rely on a right of self-defence or on a state of necessity in order to preclude the wrongfulness of the construction of the wall, and that such construction and its associated régime were accordingly contrary to international law.

Now very few Western political leaders have the courage to oppose the US and their *might is right* doctrine but that doesn't mean that we should not be accurate when discussing these complicated matters."
isreal is hamas number one financial backer. iran warned the israeli government of impending hamas attacks a week prior. idf solidiers fired indiscriminately into crowds of civilian israelis. hamas does not exist in a vacuum. and palestinians have a right to defend themselves from foreign invaders who have terrorized them every day for 75 years.
The irony of all ironies. I imagine all those children that lost their parents and siblings in Gaza will just grow up to become well adjusted adults. We all know the trauma of having all your dear ones taken away from you in one go and then having to live in a tent will surely make the people love Israel and desire peace….
By picking a side .. I see. That should cause peace.

"She won't have influence on Israel directly, but she has a big voice (representing a major western city) that could call on our Federal representation to do more, and that could cascade to other western nations who are paying attention."

"You think Hamas is going to watch protests and go pack it up guys, 100k people showed up in Toronto! Are you okay? They're terrorists lmfao they aren't beholden to anyone.

Real governments are, however, to the people and the people want their governments to use their power to do something to lower the number of civilian deaths we're seeing. 

Also to protest Israel's disproportionate response is to protest the potential for a Hamas 2.0 like even if they eradicate Hamas now you're literally just creating a highly motivated angry population ( if anyone survives) that will want vengeance for the deaths of their innocent children, parents, grandparents. They're giving them nothing to lose (no home, no possessions, no careers, no way out of the strip, no loved ones) and an honestly valid reason to want to fight back."

Yup and thars why the US ended it's invasion ... Oh wait ....

>our current diplomatic position on this conflict puts Canadians lives in danger unnecessarily globally

Hamas doesn't give a shit about Canadian citizens regardless of what stance we take. They'll use them as fodder just like they do their own citizens. Egypt will allow the Canadian Palestinians to cross the border from Gaza to safety when it feels like it based on security interests, regardless of any statements made

Thank god we did that.  If we hadn't, Iraq would have been invaded.  Good thing France also opposed it, because if they hadn't, I wouldn't be sitting here eating Freedom Fries.

edit: Sorry, I was just goofing around and making a joke.  Canada is geopolitically toothless and a mayor from Toronto from a country with basically zero military that is subservient to the USA and is at best a frontier-power to a state that is using Israel (and other states, tbh) as a human shield for its geopolitical interests is totally meaningless.

One of the things thats bitterly ignored at all costs by the Palestinian supporters is the fact that the constant misrepresenting, lying and speaking in bad faith about the events taking place there, and the events that have taken place there...is deeply insulting to the people of the Western Nations.   


If someone draws a picture of the prophet, they lose their shit because they find it insulting towards their beliefs. But they lie to our faces constantly with complete ease, which is a demonstration of complete contempt for our own beliefs.   


And then they want us to pressure for a ceasefire, otherwise they'll be alienation? If thats how its gonna be, I'll be glad to be alienated from them.  We hear all the time ""Oh none of the Arab countries support Hamas..."" While Hamas leadership lives like royalty in Qatar as guests of the government.

Civilian casualties will always happen in war. Millions upon millions died in WW2 alone.

That’s all they want. That’s why they’ve initiated war 4 times but this time, they’re on their own because the other countries who used to participate know not to fuck around with Israel anymore after they fucked around and found out.

"You are advocating for war crimes in your response. 

Bombing hospitals is a war crime even if enemy forces are there because it violates the principle of distinction and proportionality under international humanitarian law (IHL).

 The principle of distinction requires that parties to a conflict must distinguish between civilians and combatants, and between civilian objects and military objectives. Hospitals are considered civilian objects and receive de facto protection under the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols.1

The principle of proportionality prohibits attacks that may cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, or damage to civilian objects that would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. Bombing hospitals, even if they are used by enemy forces, would likely cause disproportionate harm to the wounded and sick, the medical personnel, and the civilian population in the vicinity. Therefore, such attacks are considered grave breaches or war crimes under IHL and could lead to individual criminal responsibility.2

Its your own arrogance you should be mad at. Its what led you to act knowledgeable and speak down to people when, per your own admission, you only informed yourself on one side of the story.   


If you didnt go get the Israeli side of the story, then you only have one side of the story. If you had gone and gotten that side, youd see that:  


\-Martyr Fund influences Israeli politics and who they elect.  
\-Israel ready to degrade/sever diplomatic ties over ceasefire pressure.  


Thus, a long rant about Israels crimes and call for a ceasefire doesnt do anything to help the Palestinians. As it puts no pressure on them to change their own routine habits of escalation that leads to the election of Far-Right govts in Israel. While also reducing our influence on Israel, making them less likely to consider our calls for de-escalation.

Of course not the Russians are still responsible for any deaths that come from the bombings. 

You cannot just say you need to evacuate or else. It's not our fault if you get killed. This is a war crime. It's clear in international law. 

Israel has a right and a duty to defend itself within the laws of war and international law."
"> If I was living in Gaza I would evacuate because I'm able bodied. However, not all people can evacuate and not all people have a place to go.

Correct, which is why people get organized government to build bomb shelters, have government officials on the ground help and direct evacuation and so on. Who’s the government in gaza? Hamas. Who’s responsible? Hamas.

> If Russia gave that city of Kiev a 72-hour ultimatum to evacuate the eastern half, which is roughly a million people equivalent to what Israel is asking of Gaza to evacuate

Kyiv had a population of 4m before the war, the local governments directed evacuations, set up air defences, and maintained bomb shelters. So yes, exactly what you said has happened there. The government has protected the citizens. However, Ukrainian military didn’t attack russian federation, so your whole example is irrelevant. UA didn’t wage a war against rf.

> Of course not the Russians are still responsible for any deaths that come from the bombings.

Rf is targeting heating infrastructure in the winter and grain infrastructure in the summer. They aren’t targeting military installations. And when they were bombing Kyiv, they were targeting high rises where literally no military installations can exist (especially considering rf officials declared they are targeting UA aviation and air defences)

> You cannot just say you need to evacuate or else. It's not our fault if you get killed. This is a war crime. It's clear in international law.

It’s been over a month. Gazans who didn’t get evacuated either don’t want to, or are being forced to stay by Hamas. In both situations the burden is no longer on IDF. Civilians are not allowed to deliberately not evacuate, and then put the onus on IDF to protect them

> Israel has a right and a duty to defend itself within the laws of war and international law.

Which part of international law allows for what happened on October 7? Which part of interpretation law allows setting up headquarters in bunkers of hospitals? By the way, some of that infrastructure was built by the soviets to the standards of withholding a nuclear strike.

"The Ukrainian example is not irrelevant you are just choosing to ignore it. 

What law allows the Israelis to occupy Palestine ? What third party sources confirm your claim that there is military infrastructure in hospitals , schools, churches , and refugee centers ?"
"> The Ukrainian example is not irrelevant you are just choosing to ignore it.

ok, let’s assume you’re right. If you’re drawing parallels between the two wars to prove a point, then tell me, when did ukrainian army cross rf border and started slaughtering rf citizens? You can’t? Then you can’t draw parallels out of this situation. Moreover, I actually described how UA government did what you claim they shouldn’t have done when they were evacuating people, maintaining bomb shelters with food and water etc.

> What law allows the Israelis to occupy Palestine ?

If Arabs can live in Israel, then Jews can live in the West Bank. Arabs need to create a country first and foremost, instead they engage in terrorism. 

> What third party sources confirm your claim that there is military infrastructure in hospitals , schools, churches , and refugee centers ?

Two problems with this question. First, doesn’t matter what I say, it won’t be an authority for you, so instead you should name what third parties you consider to be authority whose word you will believe. 
Second, If the military infrastructure is there, Hamas is never going to let anyone in to verify it. 

So far there are lots of videos coming out of gaza where you can see people in civilian clothes engaging in shooting at IDF. As well as photo/video of keeping rocket launchers at schools and some were even disguised as water tanks."
"The ukrainians do not need to ""invade"" Russia for my point to be relevant. 

There was a small scale civil war between Ukrainian Russian forces and Ukraine forces in Donbass happening if you are looking for context. 

Me asking for non biased sources is only a problem for your argument. My opinions change as facts change, I'm not here to educate you on what a third party independent source is."
"> There was a small scale civil war between Ukrainian Russian forces and Ukraine forces in Donbass happening if you are looking for context.

By definition it’s impossible to have a civil war between two different countries. Russian military invaded in 2014. 

And again, as I’ve said, UA government managed evacuations, bomb shelters, food and water, organized living arrangements and so on. All of those things which you say the my didn’t need to do. 

> I'm not here to educate you on what a third party independent source is.

I didn’t say “what”, I said “who”. Would Ukrainian military experts be sufficient? Or what about American outlets? Who do YOU believe?"

Awesome.  I'm sure we can all rest better now that the Liberals have called for a ceasefire and that Hamas & Israel are heeding their words.
"What if Hamas gave back all their hostages instead?  

Or Hamas can surrender

Those should be the two options presented."
"Not for release of hostages, eh?

In a supposed ceasefire negotiations, Israel is supposed to stop the attacks. What is Gaza bringing to the table? Return of hostages? Guarantees of no more rocket attacks on Israeli cities? No more cross border raids for kidnapping civilians?

Or are there no demands on the Gazans whatsoever? They can continue doing what they do, with no actual consequences."
"The only butchery is done by the terrorists, and they still have many hostages, so how about no?"

"A ceasefire, truce, or armistice rarely ends the conflict for good unless both sides are worn out, and mutually agree that neither can win and the war is thus regrettable- a rare phenomenon in military history. More often, ceasefires are mere breathers for one or both sides to frantically resupply and rearm for rounds two, three, four...

Unless the antithetical political agendas that lead to war are resolved, then breathers and truces and time-outs eventuall ensure lengthy or multiple wars. Victory leading to the loser's abandonment of political agendas more often leads to lasting peace."
These MPs don't believe in Israel's right to defend themselves.

Having the right to defend yourself does not translate to the right to keep killing civilians.
"It's not ""complicated"" just simply stop bombing gaza civilians.  Like holy shit  why's that so hard to understand.  The hypocrisy this sub shows when it condemned russia for bombing ukriakian civilians vs what Israel os doing is absolutely crazy."
"Defending yourself doesn't mean committing even greater war crimes. Once they've done that, it ceases being about defense and their right to self defense isn't a point they can fall back on and use as an excuse over and over. 

Cutting off power, water and supplies to 2 million people is a war crime. That is collective punishment, it's defined in the Geneva Conventions. 

One atrocity is **not** an excuse for Israel to cause another."
"“The issue is that Hamas is still harbouring hostages that it took from Israel during the attack. That's one issue,” he told reporters Wednesday morning.

* Since 1967, Israel has arrested an estimated one million Palestinians, and one in every five Palestinians has been arrested and charged under the 1,600 military orders that control every aspect of their lives. The incarceration rate doubles for Palestinian men. In comparison, the US has an imprisonment rate of one in 200 people, with Black Americans having a likelihood of spending time in jail more than three times the overall rate
* The Hamas Group, which launched an audacious terror attack on Israel on October 7, has offered to release all hostages on a condition. A senior Hamas official told NBC News that the armed group was willing to release all civilian hostages immediately if Israel stops its airstrikes on Gaza. Reported two days ago.

""The second is Israel has a right to defend itself, and in part of that defence, it means helping deal with the structure of the current Hamas regime. If that regime is not dealt with, then as time goes by, they will simply rebuild, they will rebuild stronger and Israel will be at threat again""

* The Palestinian people have the right to resist the Israeli occupation and defend themselves against the violence that they face every day. The right to resist is recognized under international law and is specifically endorsed for occupied people. The Hamas regime is a product of the Israeli occupation and its policies, which have led to the oppression of the Palestinian people. The root cause of the conflict is the occupation itself, and until it is resolved, there will be no peace. Israel’s right to defend itself does not justify its continued violation of Palestinian human rights and international law. It is time for Israel to end its occupation and work towards a just and lasting peace with the Palestinian people."
"But Zuberi said people in the Gaza Strip died before the latest conflict escalation, too, and the only way to save innocent lives is for bombs to stop falling.

“I know that civilians are dying,” the MP said.

“And if I was behind an artillery cannon and I knew this would fall on hospitals and schools I would not push that trigger,” Zuberi said, as his voice filled with emotion."
Kind of shows how far up their own ass they are right
"It’s pretty wild to see one sided statements like this one.

How come they didn’t speak up right after the attack?  Talk about how kidnapping civilians is a “war crime”?  Intentionally killing civilians?

They wait until Israel rightfully defends itself to say “whoa there, let’s take it easy guys!”"
"> Or are there no demands on the Gazans whatsoever? They can continue doing what they do, with no actual consequences.

lol man, even the most partisan hack can't look at the state of Gaza and think they've suffered ""no actual consequences"". Be real.

Edit: To include the quote in question."
"At the height of their bombing campaign Israel was killing a child every 15 minutes, over 1500 children killed so far. The butchery is unimaginable and the numbers would make even the terrorists blush."
"To continue your analogy with ISIS, it cost 10,000 civilian deaths to retake Mosul from ISIS. 

Can anyone find a single headline or politician calling for a cease-fire then?"
"We can't though.  ISIS was given a lot of free reign at first, established command structures that were clearly visible and were an active non-guerilla enemy - closer to a standing army.  Hamas is fundamentally different.

When Hamas kills an Israeli, they celebrate, and Hamas gets stronger.  When the Israeli's kill a Palestinian (be they Hamas or no), the Palestinian people cry out, and Hamas gets stronger.  The more the Palestinians suffer - the stronger Hamas grows.  The water blockages, the food blockages, the dead civilians and all the suffering on both sides - Hamas grows strong on that.

They're a genocidal cancer that feeds on human suffering."
Didn't Israel help ISIS in Syria?
"Clearly it is the genocide of an entire people after you cage them in so they can't escape and block all food, water, power and humanitarian aid.  Clearly the apartheid prison solution wasn't working well, so, time for the final solution I guess.

"> How can a ceasefire happen when there are hostages still in play?

I don't think I understand the rationale here. I would have thought hostages existing throughout the area would make it easier to stop dropping bombs on that area. 

But then you'd think innocent children existing in that same area would do the same I guess."
War always kills civilians. Unfortunately Hamas is also using civilians as a shield so collateral damage is inevitable.
"This is massive idealogical fallacy lmao. Any soverign state that has come under attack by terrorists killing > 1000 civilians would react the same way as Israel. 

Your telling me if Mexican cartels crossed the border into the U.S. committed wholesale slaughter of innocents, and then starts firing rockets into the US. 

That there wouldn’t be a proportional response, and that the US would show restraint? 

You sir are living on another planet"
">Since 1967, Israel has arrested an estimated one million Palestinians, and one in every five Palestinians has been arrested and charged

This just sounds like Hamas is really good at training terrorists. Every person that comes out of there is full of hate.

&#x200B;

>the armed group was willing to release all civilian hostages immediately if Israel stops its airstrikes on Gaza.

According to who? Where did you see this? Israel is the only one that said that they will allow humanitarian aid to Gaza if they release hostages - Hamas said no.

&#x200B;

>The Palestinian people have the right to resist the Israeli occupation and defend themselves against the violence that they face every day.

Bro what the fuck are you talking about? Israel didn't waltz into Gaza and brutally raped and murdered innocent civilians. Violence was never going to get them anywhere, and it definitely won't now. Peace is the only option, but the people of Gaza chose to elect a nazi baby beheading government. All they do is preach hate and violence."
You realize Gaza hasn't been occupied for two decades now right?
They are a bunch of deluded cult members. Reality doesn’t even exist for these people. When is Justin going to make a speech about gender equality during war or some other fluff?
Hamas has committed so many warcrimes it’s not even funny.
"They hate Jews, period."
"Palestinians are suffering, not Hamas. What he said is correct. If Hamas can play this terrible game of “we’ll randomly attack and butcher your people, indiscriminately launch rockets at you, and then plead for ceasefire so there’s no repercussions” then they’ll never stop."
Where'd you get those numbers from?
"Hamas is not ISIS this is false equivalency. Hamas is born out of the Israeli occupation of Palestinians, its only target is Israel. As long as the occupation continues there will always be a Hamas or something to replace it. That was not the case with ISIS. Therefore even 10000 deaths will not eliminate Hamas. If anything it will strengthen it."
"I'm sure there is some conspiracy theory stating that. But in reality, no"
"> and block all food, water, power and humanitarian aid.


None of which was happening until a particular death cult decided to launch a surprise rape/murder attack.  

Palestine - launching surprise attacks, then getting their asses handed to them in a high hat and THEN whining about the consequences - name a more iconic duo."
"Remember when Chretien said ""no thanks"" to GW Bush's ""coalition of the willing"" in Iraq?  There was a similar outcry.  

Look what happened.  250,000 dead civilians and a destroyed country later...  Yeah, we were on the right side of history on that one.  Despite what all the armchair Warhawks demanded at the time...."
"No, not even vaguely close, unless you're insinuating the Jews in Warsaw fist waged an open war (which they lost), then decided not to acknowledge the state of Germany and get their lost land back, and had launched a massive guerilla war where they hid behind Jewish civilians, had just launched a deliberate rape/murder campaigns on German civilians in and around Warsaw, and openly chanted 'From Warsaw to Bavaria, We'll purge the land of Gemania'.

Edit - cleaned up an error where I had 'the Bavaria', as I originally had 'From Warsaw to the Rhine, we'll have a free Palestine', but I wanted to keep the analogy consistent."
That's not what happened during the Warsaw uprising.

Give me a break...
It is already here.
"It’s a good question. I’m not justifying the air raids, but that some sort of military intervention has to take place if Hamas won’t release the hostages. Any country would do the same to rescue their citizens."
Israel traded 1000 Hamas terrorists for 1 Jew and now those 1000 Hamas terrorists are killing Jews.
"Hamas does not literally grab a civilian and use it as a human shield, the reason people say that is because Hamas lives among civilians. In either case killing the civilian is not the morally correct decision."
"You are wrong to compare Israel to a sovereign state attacked by terrorists. Israel occupies Palestinian lands and violates their rights. Hamas is not just a militant group, but a political party with a popular mandate. Israel's response is disproportionate and indiscriminate, causing more death and destruction than Hamas's rockets. You need to learn more about the history and complexity of the conflict, and the aspirations and demands of both sides."
"The US doesn't control Mexico's access to water and food. I'm living on earth, you're jumping through hoops to feel good about your opinions. 

What Israel is doing is a war crime."
"I understand that you have a different perspective on the situation. However, it is important to recognize that the Palestinian people have been subjected to decades of occupation, violence, and oppression by Israel. The high number of arrests and detentions of Palestinians is a clear indication of the systematic violation of their human rights. The right to resist the occupation is recognized under international law and is specifically endorsed for occupied people. It is also important to note that Hamas is not the only group that has been targeted by Israel’s military operations. The Israeli government has a long history of using excessive force against Palestinian civilians, including women and children. It is time for Israel to end its occupation and work towards a just and lasting peace with the Palestinian people."
"> Palestinians are suffering, not Hamas. What he said is correct.

He literally said ""Gazans"", not ""Hamas""."
"Agree to disagree. 

Where and why they were born is irrelevant. In real life they are both murdering zealot organisations. They are the same evil. And they cannot grow stronger if you go all in and remove them all. 

ISIS grew stronger when left alone/facing weak and disorganized counterparts. When enough people decided that it was enough, they got chased right down to their last entrenchments.

This thread is about ceasefire so I'm just writing as to when that should happen. IF they stop now, yeah, they will eventually come back. So don't stop."
Gaza hasn't been occupied for decades now
"Hamas leaders have stated that finishing the holocaust by killing all Jews is only the first part of their plan of genocide, and after this other Christian’s worldwide will follow. So yeah, nuke them."

"> Any country would do the same to rescue their citizens.

Well, every country would do *something* to rescue their citizens. I'm not sure how many would choose this route."
"For sure. Doesn't that bolster my point?

If that's the exchange rate, clearly they value Israeli lives immensely and will do almost anything to get them back alive. 

Shouldn't that make it easy to stop bombing them?"
No. They quite literally do not allow civilians to leave the area once they get warning a strike is coming.
"hamass shoots rockets at israel from residential neighborhoods - that makes those areas a legitimate military target.  Hamas figures the presence of civilians will deter Israel - i.e. Hamass uses them as Human shields.

Hamass does the same thing by locating bombmaking labs in residential areas, storing munitions in schools and using medical clinics as access to their tunnels - where they hide. They even put their HQ underneath a hospital making it a legitimate military target.

Hamass may not put a person in front of a missile, but they make sure that any missile attack will kill innocents. 

i.e. human shields."
"Those would be the first thing bombed by the USAF, don’t get it twisted lmao…"
">It is time for Israel to end its occupation and work towards a just and lasting peace with the Palestinian people.

The Palestinians don't want peace. They rejected every single peace proposition they ever got - including one where they would get 99% of the land they are asking for now.

Israel proposed peace dozens of times, it was rejected every time.

&#x200B;

>The right to resist the occupation is recognized under international law 

If your definition of ""resisting and occupation"" is to rape women, brutally murder civilians, behead and burn babies, kidnap children, women, men, elderly who are all innocent - you need to take a hard look at yourself.

The Palestinian people need to accept that Israel is a country. It's a land that was fought for with blood and heavy sacrifices. If you (or the people of Gaza) think Israel would ever allow 2 million Palestinians to become Israeli citizens, they need to wake up. No country wants them, even those who support them the most - why in the world should Israel accept them?

They need to move on. Get their independence in Gaza by starting a revolution against Hamas that steals all their money, use the 1 billion a year that they get to build a country they can be proud of. Instead, they choose violence and killing jews."

"Didn't say that.  Pointed out that there was context you were deliberately stripping from the conversation.  Like how Palestine (and all the other nations that surrounded Israel) tried to wipe it out back in 67, and got their asses handed to them.

Interesting side note - Egypt, who lost a TON of land in 67, ended up acknowledging Israel's right to exist after that war and ended up getting all it's land back.  

You figure if Palestine had done the same, Palestine would have gotten it's 1966 border back?"

They ordered the complete evacuation of the entire north half of Gaza, where over a million people live, within 24 hours. Something the UN said was not possible without catastrophic consequences

The easiest thing to claim after blowing up a child is they were ""a human shield""

Why would Hamas even take human shields? It's very clear by now Israel has no qualms with blowing up men women or children, so it doesn't even make sense as an excuse"
"Setting aside Hamas and rockets and terrorism for a moment, do you think Palestinians have a right to defend themselves against the Israeli blockade on their territory? If so what do you think would be a valid form of defence? If not, why not?"
"The Palestinians do want peace, but not at the expense of their rights and dignity. They rejected the peace propositions that were unfair and unjust, such as the one that offered them only 42% of the West Bank and no sovereignty over East Jerusalem or the refugee issue. Israel did not propose peace dozens of times, but rather imposed its conditions and demands on the Palestinians, while continuing to expand its illegal settlements and violate international law.

The right to resist the occupation is indeed recognized under international law, as stated in the UN General Assembly Resolution 3246. The Palestinians have used various forms of resistance, including non-violent protests, civil disobedience, and legal action. The majority of Palestinians do not condone or support violence against civilians, regardless of their nationality or religion. The accusations of rape, murder, beheading, and kidnapping being the only form of resistance are baseless and inflammatory, and only serve to demonize and dehumanize the Palestinian people.

The Palestinian people do not deny the existence of Israel, but they demand that Israel recognize their right to self-determination and statehood within the 1967 borders, as endorsed by the international community and the Arab Peace Initiative. The Palestinians in Gaza are not asking to become Israeli citizens, but to end the siege and blockade that have turned Gaza into an open-air prison for more than 14 years. No country wants them because they are refugees who have been denied their right to return to their homes and lands that were taken by Israel in 1948. Israel should accept them because they are human beings who deserve justice and dignity.

They cannot move on until they achieve their freedom and independence from the occupation and oppression that have lasted for more than seven decades. They cannot start a revolution against Hamas, which was democratically elected by the people of Gaza in 2006, without risking a civil war and further bloodshed. They cannot use the money they get to build a country they can be proud of, when most of it goes to humanitarian aid and basic needs, and when Israel controls their borders, resources, economy, and movement. They do not choose violence and killing Jews, but rather seek to defend themselves and their rights from the violence and killing inflicted by Israel."
"And Israel's right to defend it self doesn't include bombing hospitals, cutting off food, water and medical supplies to over a million kids, carpet bombing the whole city, I can go on. The Israeli's have killed 10x more innocents civilians and kids then Hamas could dream of you Buffoon."
"The motivations are irrelevant. Both grandiloquent, unending and murderous. Idiotic projects. 

And yeah, you can litteraly eliminate anyone using the exact same tactics irregardless of their motivations.

Anyway."
The PA have recognized Israel's right to exist and that hasn't stopped them from approving a record number of new permits this year for illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank
"There is no Palestine, Israel has consistently refused the right of a Palestinian state to exist. There is no Palestinian government. There is no Palestinian army. There are just Palestinians, majority of which are stateless refugees of Israel and all live under Israeli occupation. Including Gazans. Hamas is a militant group, it is not recognized as a government, nor does it have any control over daily life in Gaza as Israel controls Gaza’s borders, trade, water, power, and “defence”. 

Palestinians are not the ones who wanted to build an ethnostate on that land. That context predates all the wars against Israel, and is the only context that matters. Only in Israeli propaganda-land is the party that wanted to build an ethnostate and displaced millions on the basis of ethnicity to achieve it considered the victim and the people it displaced and now occupies considered the aggressors."
"Not sure you're really following the conversation man, sorry."
"No offence, but you aren't exactly engaging with the content here. 

Just saying ""destroy Hamas"" is kind of silly."
"no I do not.

once upon a time, when Israel left gaza, there was no IDF, there were no settlers, it was all nice and judenrein, all ethnically pure.

and there was no blockade or fence.

it was only once terrorists starting leaving gaza and attacking israel that israel built a fence, and then developed iron dome, and imposed a blockade.

Gaza had the chance to play nice and show the world what it was aspiring to. And they showed the world. They showed the world what they would do if they were given the opportunity.

neither do I agree with your choice of words - defense.  Attacking someone for no reason is not defense. As mentioned they had not restrictions.  Their ""defense"" as you term it would be to stop attacking israel, and doing everything they can to destroy Israel.

a gate and iron dome are passive defensive measures. going out and murdering/immolating whole families in their beds, dragging semi naked dead girls in the street chanting allahu akbar, is not a defense - it is an act of agression, of desired genocide,  showing the true character and wished of the cowardly Hamass terrorists."
You can't negotiate with terrorists.
"the PA and hamas charter both call for the destruction of Israel. Yeah, they recognize Israel exists, and their goal is to destroy it.

Gaza was not occupied. Israel left in 2006. took all the settlers and soldiers with them. left the palestinians a nice judenrein location to try and build something. Well they did, a terrorist enclave. (and don't say barricade this, fence that - those only started AFTER the terrorist attacks)

and enough with the open air prison lie. every country has the right to allow/disallow whomever/whatever they want  from entering their country. Perhaps palestinians should have considered that. 

I wonder if you even realize what you said that accusing someone of murder and kidnapping is dehumanizing. Well what do you call someone who does those things? You forgot to mention immolating. 

no country wants them, because they regularly cause instability and try to attack the country that takes them in. Like Egypt and Jordan.

of course they cannot use the money to build a country to be proud of. it is used for weapons. Even the water pipes were dug up to be used as rockets to attack israel.  And then gaza complains they have no water.

stop apologizing for and justifying terrorism."
"Defensive operations against terrorist states that just revealed through an act of mass slaughter of civilians that their will to mass murder of civilians is constrained only by their available means, which they are working tirelessly to augment

Hiding amidst the civilian population and exposing them to danger and death, which is a war crime, cannot be a magic bullet for impunity in the wake of acts of mass murder of civilians. Those who join mass murderers in a call for a ceasefire the day after a mass murder of civilians seek to provide this impunity - and thus to enable further acts of mass murder of civilians

Hamas made its genocidal motives clear - that the scale of its mass murder of civilians is constrained only by the available means and that any state confronted by such a foe would wage war as is its right.

Israel isn’t obligated under the rules of war to provide food, water, electricity to an entity trying to exterminate them.

Finally, regarding your question about General Dwight Eisenhower, it is important to recognize that strategic bombing campaigns during World War II were controversial and resulted in significant loss of civilian life. However, it is also important to recognize that these actions were taken in the context of a global conflict against an enemy that was committing genocide against millions of innocent people. The situation in Palestine today is vastly different from the situation during World War II, and it is not appropriate to draw comparisons between them"
"> It's only silly to a terrorist sympathizer. Are you a terrorist sympathizer?

Sorry man, I think this topic is really interesting/important and am only interested in engaging with people operating at a more...adult level. I'm out."
The day Islamic countries get held to the same standards as they try to hold Israel to is the day this all ends
" Not this time. Every time Israel has done a hostage exchange, the HamAss members that are released end up comitting more terror attacks.

It is not even known if they are still alive.

and Hamas started this war. a war to the death. It is not that the hostages are not important, or that israel will not try to get them back, but the primary goal is the complete annihilation of Hamas."
"You realize you are in a Canada forum right? What does this have to do with Islamic countries? Have you seen all the protests throughout the world in support of Palestine? You don't see the same support for Israel.

The official who was involved in arms transfers to US allies for 11 years resigned  in protest over Washington’s decision to boost military aid to Israel.

The world is on the side of Palestine."
What’s the challenge.  Have students go to lecture and have professors teach relevant materials.  No need for the school to have an opinion on the matter.
Maybe universities should stick to unbiased education which enables critical thinking?
York University had and possibly still has a mural in one of the buildings of a Palestinian throwing rocks.
"Canadian universities should never have gotten into the business of commenting on current events and condemning and supporting various groups in the first place. It politicizes the education system, and emboldens radical activists within universities, and it’s none of their business.   


But what we have seen in their messaging reflects a complete and utter rot at the moral and intellectual core of Canadian academia. The decolonization rhetoric of protestors, academics, and organizers is the direct result of a failed education system that has taught the public to fetishize oppression, elevate grievance, and celebrate the taking of innocent lives so long as they’re of the right kind.   


Viewing all conflicts through the lens of a Sociology 101 textbook has stupefied our public institutions and alienated us from true notions of justice, equality, and morality."
"The quicker we move away from the idea that universities' opinions on anything matters, the better.

They're there theoretically to educate people and to make stupid amounts of profit by exploiting the wishes of foreigners wanting to become Canadian. Nothing else."
"a year after i graduated, there was a student referendum to have the university cut ties with israeli universities because the latter cooperate with Israeli government. the proposer was a student funded research group that lean hard left. the referendum failed by 85% vs 15%.

the next student body election, the candidates running were divided along whether they want to defund the research group or not, and the pro-defund won it clean slate. and thus the research group went from getting money from extra fee in tuition that students have to opt out of to not pay (had to show up to their office and ask refund), to be defunded over this matter.  

good that my almamater seems to learn about it and clearly side against Hamas violence."
"Because it’s not a university’s place to take positions on political conflicts. 

Let students research in a safe space, and if they publish something controversial, they can live with the consequences."
"This is from York like JFC how hard is it to say we condemn what Hamas did oh no we stand with Palestine ""decolonizing"" their land 

https://static1.squarespace.com/static/534d4d15e4b0458a1fec3b4e/t/652872b0a266b0042143437f/1697149616600/Statement+of+Solidarity+with+Palestine.pdf"
"People that value “decolonization” over stability are insane.

Man I’m so progressive I want to incite a land war instead of trying to peacefully coexist"
"""face challenges"" is a funny way of saying ""face the reality that an uncomfortably large segment of student and faculty groups openly glorified the systematic murder of Israeli civilians, including women and children"". The rot runs deep and these people are used to getting away with no one calling them out on their vile views, but the sheer brutality and barbarism of these attacks has shaken people from their complacency."
"At McGIll we received 3 emails:

The first was neutral, the second condemned clubs that we're pro hamas and the third denounced terrorism. Clearly, the third one was only sent due to pressure as it would had been lumped in the first email where they inquired about student distress had it been a genuine email.

They're clearly trying to navigate the anti-israel sentiments that have haunted universities over the last decade. Its sad Israel's success with keeping terrorist attack impacts at bay with the wall built and the iron dome just prompts a more negative outlook on them because they don't seem like as much of a victim of terrorism.

A consequence of this terror attack's success (there have been many thwarted terror attacks since) will be a reminder for the absence of moral equivalence between both sides. One side targets the other civilians while protecting their military with their civilians and the other uses their military technology (iron dome) to protect their citizens. Very important to remember this."
"I actually find it pretty simple. 

Anyone, celebrating, or honouring the terrorism from Saturday should be expelled and deported."
"Refusing a vaccine or posting about Freedom Convoy = expulsion

Cheering Hamas for killing civilians = no reprecussions

Yeah the past 3 years shows where our bizarre groupthink has taken us (and rem these kids who graduate will be LEADING country soon enough)

Universities certainly have morals clauses and they have used them in the past. But you know stuff like street parties during lockdowns, those are the real issues"
"I remember sitting in the Cock and Bull pub at York University on 9/11 watching in disgust as the student body were openly cheering and high fives  as the towers fell. 

This problem of naive and radical idealists in Canadian Universities is at least two decades old."
"This is the problem with modern progressive universities. Universities should be fairly simple. There’s a certain number of students than can be admitted each year. Of all the applicants only the best applicants should be accepted. Conditions of acceptance should be based on academic ability, life experience and some outreach programs to look for students in poorer and underserved communities. Aside from that set a number (maybe 10-20%) for international students, and choose them based on the same criteria as you select local students. Then everyone goes to class and learns the curriculum. If you aren’t in a political science class there is zero reason to even discuss this conflict at school. Teach math, physics, biology, English or whatever class you’re in. University’s are far too political now, go back to the time when they were just schools that gave people advanced education and taught them how to think."
"I loved going to politics and international conflicts related courses right after something major had happened. 

The classes are quiet, the profs are careful, and ask critical questions, where the prof really gives all the info he has on the topic, theories, cases etc. And let the students come to a conclusion. All the while outlining that you cannot have a complete opinion on things. There is no right or wrong. There is only what works for them/us. 

After a couple of these events; like Covid, israel-Palestine, Canadian trucker protest, etc. It really made me understand everyone has their own reality and narrative, and ethics and standards can slip at a moments notice. 

Critical thinking is what I got from uni, sure was worth it."
"Translation: 
University: how can we continue to indoctrinate students with our lefty philosophies without they realizing we are condoning atrocities."
"Maybe we have a massive antisemitism problem in post secondary. Seems pretty worrisome. We found the white supremacists, they're University Professors getting paid over 100k/yr"
Speaking truth is best just in case if someone can't bear it then let them go with their choice but choose truth to deliver.
"In November, Toronto will host the North American Anthropology Association conference. This organization is boycotting Israel. Israeli universities cannot participate. This means that 100s of Canadian researchers will use public funds to travel and register for an organization that won't let Israelis participate. You can Google the meeting and read the presentations that will happen, many of which are extreme, referring to Hamas as a Palestinian rights organization and Israel as a settler military occupation.

The problem is real."
"Well to be fair there's a rich history and decades of conflict, so it's not a simple good vs evil. There are still innocent lives being destroyed that make me sick. There definitely is universities where it's so insanely left they lose sense and overlook negatives about cultures that are inherently wrong with western beliefs. That's thankfully not my experience, but I was in sciences. 

I've heard horror stories about lack of diverse thought in departments of course, but I don't think it's nearly as common in practice. Canada universities you'd think would be more extreme than the US in this regard, but all the examples are US universities, like UofCali, private institutions, etc.

People using this as more villainizing of higher education are playing themselves and using extreme cases as the arguments, which is Politics favorite pasttime these past 7 years. What ever happened to the extreme cases not being representative of groups."
There is no challenge here. Label hamas acts as terrorism and ban acts of support of terrorists or face being expelled. See?
What's the challenge? Upsetting donors?
Theoretically it shouldn't be difficult to discuss or navigate this war - as long as the educational institution in question is not packed to the brim with fiery political activists.
"I HATE that I had to give my money to YFS and WPIRG when I went to York. I felt like I was putting my money in the hands of people that literally didn’t believe I should have human rights (I’m Jewish, not even Israeli). Their hateful rhetoric is finally being seen. I’m so happy."
"We all really need to stop giving a shit what these corrupt, inept institutions think about anything. The “experts”. We could also benefit from ignoring what the Canadian medias collective opinion on matters is as well, maybe then they can get back to reporting facts instead of trying to control peoples opinions."
This they're worried about but not about 70-80% international students?
How are the Lefty Professors going to spin this one?
"There is nothing to navigate.   1200 citizens were murdered, 300 of them children.

There was no declaration of war, nothing.  Caught them 100% off guard.

What happens next will be horrible, and get worse.   

Hamas in 100% targeted and now they are going to be eliminated and defeated.   Israel would be stupid to stop before that.

Look at it like this, nobody will ever pull a 911 on the USA again.   Probably 2 million died in their rampage and nobody gives a shit.

This was their 911."
It is actually very easy to navigate. Just teach facts and do not foster anti-Semitism.
"This has really exposed how deep the rot goes and the more ""prestigious"" the universities the worse it is. The shit coming out of some of the Ivy league schools in the USA is pretty stunning"
How come? Just go to lecture and study like normal
"Unless your well versed in geopolitical events, you should probably sit this one out."
"I love how my teen thought there was a clear solution,  until I said “ perfect let’s apply that to the Indigenous people of Canada”"
Virtue signaling is too engrained
"Concordia Riot, 2002.

Pepperidge Farm remembers."
Why do universities need an opinion on the issue? Just shut up and teach.
I'm not sure if students in Canada taking positions and fighting about this affects the situation on the ground in any way. Might be more sensible to focus on schooling and not politics.
Woke the shit out of it.
I guess everyone forgot about the Ukraine war .. just like Putin wanted.
I love when the left eats itself.
The real solution here is not having 80% international students. Ezpz.
Universities and educational institutions are becoming the hot seat for global politics.. diverse population = diverse political views…
"Once upon a time Universities were institutions of higher learning and critical thinking. Now, they are capitalist corporations trying to take in the money while not upsetting anyone. What a joke."
"Back in early 2000, We had an area next to Tim Hortons on Campus used to be called Gaza Strip. Where all Palestinian and some Jordanian/Syrians/Egyptians used to hangout all day. It was the time of post 9/11 and you see them pretty much making marchers on   every little news regarding  US arrest/kill of  terrorists.

Sometime makes you wonder, what's their priorities? Why are they here if their cause is something else."
"When I was in university 10years ago, denouncing Israel was the edgy liberal thing to do. Seems it caught on and new students provably took it to more extremes to show how open minded they are and now they look stupid so they are doubling down instead of quietly distancing themselves from something they clearly knew nothing about."
I stand with Israel 🇮🇱. Fk Palestine🖕
The plan to separate people into various groups and categories and then virtue signalling support to all of them is now falling apart.
Why are universities giving their opinion?
Just stop letting anti-semitism flourish on campus
"I wonder how many of those sniveling about Israel bombarding Gaza were similarly upset when Syria was bombarding Aleppo for all those months? I have a feeling very few were. Certainly there were no outraged cries from universities, no crowds in the streets.

Ah, but now it's Jews doing it. So that changes everything."
At this point it's the Israeli government and ever citizen vs Hamas. the Palestinians bitch about lack of infrastructure then let Hamas pull up water lines to make rockets.
"Idiots. They only face challenges because they make everything complicated.

Teach, and shut up. Stop brainwashing students with your personal agendas."
It's hard for the university to explain why some fight for their homes. While Canadians give their country away.
"So one group moved into an area,  seized land,  drove the native population into certain zones and killed thousands of the native population.

When the English did that to native Americans,  the English were the bad guys. 


When the Israelis to it to Palestinians,  the Palestinians are the bad guys? 


Let's pick a lane folks....

Is it evil to invade and take the homes from someone else,  or not?"
Maybe stick to the curriculum and teach the students stuff they pay you to teach
"History matters. Israel was created in 1947/48, the West should have gave Jewish people their own land, instead of giving them Palestine without the consent of Palestinians."
Maybe middle eastern immigrants should move back to the Middle East if they want to fight this out so badly.
"Support israel of course? How are they going to defend Hamas? Hamas could have only attacked military bases and supplies, instead they attacked, raped, paraded innocent civilian populations and massacred them  


And also, these are universities. Why is this even being brought up?"
"There’s no “challenge.”

You stand with Israel or you stand with terrorism and Hamas. End of story."

"One thing I'm noticing from the left is that if we can identify the reason why any bad behaviour is happening then they will justify it and be against any action being taken to enforce good behaviour. Whether BLM riots, homeless people using drugs/robbing people, hamas attacks, indigenous violence etc"
"Why are so many Canadians Pro-apartheid and against Palestinians? I am appalled that these “humble-kind Canadian” image I once had were just a fake mask to hide all the hatred thats under it. Its sad 
How can people in the right mind supports systemic genocide of Palestinians and neglect seven decades of settler colonialism?"
"As an Israeli, I would prefer if politics were kept out of Universities in general, regardless whom you affiliate with or support. 

Any act that is deemed to be political should be banned for the safety and security of everyone involved. 

Under current conditions, this should extend to any flag being flown or statement made or displayed with the specific intent to convey a political message."
"What challenge?  Just bring in more international students because they pay more, and then they can 100% support hamas or separation of Punjab from India or the one china policy."
"""International relations is a difficult subject.""

Thanks, tips!"
That’s because they are too many immigrants in Canadian schools
"There is a genocide currently underway in Gaza. If you're reading this please act now. 2.5 million Palestinian non-military personnel, 50% of whom are children, are collectively being punished via genocide for the terrorist attacks that Hamas committed in central and southern israel this past weekend. Food, water, electricity, gas, are not allowed in. The aerial campaign of bombings has already laid waste to hospitals, UN schools, and red cross and UN aid workers have already died. These actions alll sanctioned by the Israeli goverment are already underway. It is 6 days in and now there is going to be a ground invasion. This is a campaign of mass starvation and genocide for which there is no escape for Gazans, whose only crossing out of the area has been bombed and rendered unusable. All the while, the Israeli government issues public statements of 24 hour evacuation warning for the 2.5 million Palestinian civilians to cover their asses but there is nowhere to go, and nobody in the history of humanity has successfully evacuated that many ppl in tht amount of time. Israel has also blockaded Gaza from air and sea, and threatened to bomb medical aid supplies coming in from Egypt.Peaceful protesters in the nearby West Bank are being murdered at by Israeli military. The Associated Press, The Guardian and other newspapers in the west fired journalists (jewish ones even) for speaking out about what is happening. The United States is fully funding this genocide campaign, as they did for 1million iraqi civilians in 2008, and protests are currently illegal nationwide in France, Germany, and the UK, where peaceful protesters have been arrested for saying ""free palestine"" and waving palestinian flags.Regardless of my thoughts on the history of the conflict, it is my responsibility to do what I can to prevent the nation that claims to represent the descendants of survivors of the worst documented genocide in human history, from committing a genocide of their own in Gaza. The deaths of innocent Israelis at the hands of Hamas cannot be used to justify the genocide of a 50% under15-aged population of 2.3 million innocent Palestinians in Gaza today. If you're reading this, please speak up now before it's too late. Our ancestors are watching us"

What about housing students? There is no challenge there?
"Canada could focus more on its core competence in natural resources and less on Ponzi schemes like diploma mills and realestate flipping. That would possible help to shield us from stuff that happens thousands of miles away ! But unfortunately, for most of natural resources _there is no business case_"
Just go the diploma mill route
"I agree it shouldn't matter but this issue is so divisive and for some reason hits to the heart of so many people that aren't even involved in this situation.  I've seen students on my university campus get into fights over this shit.

For those that have families and loved ones, I feel for you and I wish you the best.  I hope this ends peacefully, although that may be naive.  

For those that have no stake in this matter yet feel the need to stoke fires and cheer sides as though this is a game, it must be so easy to sit comfortably in Canada and seek blood and conflict from people so far away, knowing it will never directly impact you."

This just in...water makes things wet.
Do they really though? I mean.. come on
Only York Univeristy which is more of a college than most colleges.
"How about politically neutral colleges that focus on learning a skill, unless it's political science I guess."
The actual problem is two different views on the same topic. Ukrainians and Palestinians are mere pawns.
"They need to focus on “their” subjects, they can have talks outside the parameters of Uni/college/school"
Really hard when you have been virtue signalling for years and now the ones you have championed are on view as evil incarnate.  i have full confidence in our liberal universities that they will rationalize thier way out of this and in doing so make Canada a laughing stock of the world once again.
What challenge? Just provide the facts and a timeline of events. Don't glorify militant actions from either side

These kids need to worry about their own future in Canada instead of fighting over politics that they don't even understand properly. This is a war where you can't take anyone’s side other than feeling sorry for suffering and waste of innocent lives. I'll be more worried about the upcoming economic meltdown in Canada than a war that has been continuing for years and which will most probably continue for centuries.

How about make universities apolitical? It should be about education…
"who would have thought the ""progressives"" who seem to glorify and enable terrorism against jewish people are always quick to label conservatives as anti-semites or racist for made up reasons.  

The left ""progressives"" are turning out to be the real racists, real anti-semites, real supremacists, the real fascists.  It's fascinating 

Racists = they think treating everyone the same regardless of race is racism lol  
Anti-semitism=guilt by association -- unless you're Trudeau  
Supremacy=constantly telling and acting on behalf of indigenous people because they think they know best about what they should find offensive.   
Fascists=constantly trying to take away people's rights and freedoms including rights to criticize government policy and policing of speech.  Or Clinton talking about re-education camps."
No one gets to hold any demonstrations. Now get your butt to class Mr.

Canadians are being hardcore distracted by issues that don't affect them or affect a very small population.
"Schools are communities. Students (and sometimes faculty) live on campus, it’s a micro society. It’s not just lecturers and exams…"
Agreed. Also let's bring back meritocracy too. I'm a liberal and I say that. Rip Richard Biltzko a real champion in that.

"Any statements are basically PR to appease students and donors while trying to minimize backlash. They'll read the wind then release something they feel will hurt their bottom line the least.

"First theres too many international students. A liberal agenda has encouraged Canadians to feel post-nationalist where they pretend to feel more aligned with their ancestral country than Canada.

"Don’t agree. I went to Uni on 9/11, desperate to make sense of what was going on, and couldn’t believe classes were business as usual."
What they really mean is “Canadian universities face challenges to continue to suppress free speech/control the narrative”
"Wow, that's so thoughtful. /s"
"When protests turn into security issues it is a problem. 

If someone you cared about was hit with a brick because of violence related to an on-campus event (and in the experience I had, this friend wasn’t even there for the rally, they were passing thru the quad) I guarantee you will be demanding that the university explain why they didn’t take steps to keep campus safe. (The friend was okay, and the university made a significant gesture to repair her trust in the campus)."
"So ""Peace and Conflict studies"" should not mention it?  The example given in the story..."
"Hah, you with your logic and avoidance of politicizing everything. That'd make way too much sense but the army of administrators needs some way to justify their existence."

"Universities are places where contentious topics are openly debated.  If we lose that, we lose a valuable social tool.

If this can't be debated in a university, where can it?"
"Ikr, it's not hard to just provide information similar to other studies. In this case it's just human conflict that is studied instead of, for example, the honey bee"
I don't think the schools should be silent to a rise in anti-Semitism.
"Right... The title makes no sense if you realize that a university doesn't need to have an ""opinion""."
I think the CPC should not only defund the CBC they should defund all higher education facilities that don't support free speech and who don't have a balance of people on the political spectrum in their faculty.
"Real solution we need to start defunding these institutions and all those ""academics"" and progressives"" should be kicked out for constantly acting to try to destroy the country."
Cause universities aren't political tools for a ruling class.....
Except there are differing opinions of what “non biased is”. There is plenty of good faith academic debate over causes of different conflicts. How much you focus on each side will be seen as bias to some and non biased to others.
Oh that ship sailed a few decades ago LOL.
"Critical thinking is learned through the study of philosophy. People who might think it is just a naturally occuring thing might, ironically lack critical thinking."
"No such thing as unbiased education. Yes, reducing bias good, critical thinking good. However if you are going to critically look at history you will never find 'unbiased knowledge' in any country, business, or person.

Just by virtue of consuming media in the English language we are inundated with propaganda from English speaking nations, in the same way that the man who only speaks Sudanese is going to have his opinions colored by the dominant perspectives in Sudan.

The point is to identify bias and make it explicit so that it can be accounted for in our judgements."
"Isn’t that what school is? 

I was never in a situation where I wasn’t engaged in critical thinking."
"You don't want universities to educate people about history, how to make comparisons, how to study complex interactions, how to debate, etc?

This is Canada you either get with the university views or get called a bigot
So fuck the humanities I guess
These days if you have a opinion that doesn’t fit the narritive you get canceled or fired
The rights movements in the '60s had them  stop educating people to  the same degree because of all the protesting. The higher quality education cost too much disruption in the corporate world of profits. They don't want you to realize that you're worth more than what you are
I think it is ridiculous. Universities are supposed to create future leaders who can deal with complex problems to help pull humanity forward. Education isolated in echo chambers is driving wedges in society that WILL drive conflict. The amount of left/right rhetoric driven in isolated echo chambers is at a all time high and is getting worse….
"Hahahah good one. No, we prefer brainwashing for profit institutions now."
They gave that up decades ago.
"How unbiased is it when funding for research comes from private investments, when a foreign military complex benefit from an engineering department in a Canadian University, when Alberta is so focused on debunking climate change and justify oil production?"
Unbiased education doesn’t really exist tho.
that would mean admitting Palestine has been oppressed for a long time
Did you read the article at all? This has nothing to do with biased professors and all to do with how to respond to the situation where Jewish students say they feel afraid to go to class because of of Pro-Palestinian rallys on campus without cutting down those students right to public demonstration. Where is the bias there? Seems like you are trying to shoehorn in a different argument here
Well theyre not genna paint one of the idf hitting the drone button are they

"It’s a little bit more complicated than that. Public Canadian universities are non-profit. The sources of their revenue primarily include provincial government funding, tuition fees, external research grants, clinical trial funding, and donations. The big one there is the provincial government funding, and provincial governments have been slowly starving them to death. The only other source of revenue they really have direct control over is tuition fees, but these are capped for Canadian students. They are NOT capped for foreign students, meaning universities can make a big profit on them, which helps fill in the cracks. Every time a government reduces post secondary spending (and remember, even, say, a 2% increase is actually a cut due to inflation and the fact that the vast majority of university employees belong to unions whose members often receive 4%+ annual increases) they are highly incentivized to bring in a lot more international students to help make up the difference. This is also why many universities tend to have terrible garbage collection and floor cleaning and old decrepit desks and carpets and so on… every time there’s a shortfall those are the first cuts they make in operating expenditures.

None of this is to say there aren’t also for-profit degree mills catering primarily to international students, where I assume their business model is driven by overcharging for tuition. No idea of what the ratio of international students attending public universities vs private ones is.

That is all a different discussion, however, than academia’s decided tilt toward supporting the Palestinians over Israel. The reasons for that are complex and varied, but anyone who thinks it doesn’t exist is fooling themselves. This generally one-sided support is a big problem for universities, because donors and governments tend to strongly dislike that stance, which may in turn impact their funding. As a great example from a donor perspective, look at Harvard right now. A bunch  of their student associations signed a letter this week condemning Israel after the murder of over 1,000 of their citizens, innocent men, women and children, and now there is a huge campaign underway to dox all the signatories so major companies (who are also major donors) can make sure to never hire any of them. Oopsie. Many of these students are now rapidly back-peddling and trying to un-sign.

I guess I don’t have much to say about that except to note that academics tend to say things like, “we must stop the cycle of violence”, but they always seem to say it the loudest *after* a bunch of Jews have already been killed. How about we break that cycle *before* all the Jew killing? Because you know how many Palestinians would have died this week due to Israeli strikes on Hamas if Hamas hadn’t decided to brutally murder over a thousand Jews? Pretty close to zero. See how that works?"
Well most universities are non for profits.
"This was the University of Waterloo and the social justice group was called WPIRG. In order to start the referendum they had to first get a certain amount of signatures. So representatives from this group would stand around campus and they would solicit people to sign the petition by slyly wording it as ""please sign this petition to end human rights abuses"", they wouldn't even mention its about cutting ties with Isreali universities. The referendum did go through but the vast majority of students voted to not cut ties with Ireali universities.  

The irony is that when the resistance to WPIRG fought back by starting their own referendum to make the WPIRG fee opt-in, WPIRG tried their best to not have the referendum go through. They would go to the arts/social science lectures (for obvious reasons) and tell the students to vote against the referendum. 

In the end like you said, the referendum did go through and the vote to defund WPIRG won by a landslide."
That's nice to hear. I remember my Alma mater being a cesspool of anti Israel rhetoric.  Seeing ridiculous signs comparing Israel to the Nazis was commonplace. The early 2000s was nuts.
"[""In any dispute the intensity of feeling is inversely proportional to the value of the issues at stake... That is why academic politics are so bitter.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre%27s_law?wprov=sfla1)"
"Sounds like bullshit to me. The typical research group is pulling funding from a half dozen different sources which are largely federal grants.

On top of this, student government, both undergrad and graduate councils, have now say whatsoever on funding at all. We know this is true because if they could unilaterally defund a single research group, they'd probably actually be spending their time giving themselves a raise above poverty level wages instead.

At best, student government will have a single seat on the board of governors who also do not have the ability to unilaterally pull funding from a single research group.

If what you believe is so righteous and true, why do you feel the need to tell such a blatant and obvious lie. Just be truthful."
"I'm pretty sure in 2019 when China was working its way into Hong Kong,  universities here were taking that approach. 

I can't read the article now, but this was the one I thought of: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-hong-kong-tensions-reach-bcs-simon-fraser-university-as-notes/"
"york's student unions have long been a hot bed of anti-semetism and the rhetoric around it long before it was the cool thing for all unions in canada to do

that letter goes a step farther then all the others by basically saying israel itself is illegitimate. a line rhetoric only brainwashed extremists think"
"I saw that, it’s pathetic. But I’m not surprised by this, students have always leaned hard-core left, even when it’s detrimental to a cause."
"The decolonization idea is the worst of all. Not only do they say ridiculous statements like ""what did you think decolonizing looks like?"" the premise itself is flawed. Jewish people have been in Israel for 3000 years. over 2000 years ago the kingdoms of David and Judea emerged following many exiles and returns. The Jewish people are the true indigenous population of the land and trying to rail against them for being colonizers takes crazy deluded mental gymnastics."
"> so-called Israel

This is absolutely insane to see in an official statement. Everyone involved in these organizations should at a minimum be under investigation for terrorist sympathies."
The irony of Jews being indigenous is crazy. Israelis aren't called Israelites because that's the name for the Jews that were there beforehand during King David's time.
Yeah I wish colonized people would just know their place and accept their roles as slaves /s
I'm sure Israel feels really stable standing with their boot on the necks of Palestinians
"*""face challenges"" is a funny way of saying ""face the reality that an uncomfortably large segment of student and faculty groups openly glorified the systematic murder of* **Palestinian** *civilians, including women and children"". The rot runs deep and these people are used to getting away with no one calling them out on their vile views, but the sheer brutality and barbarism of these attacks has shaken people from their complacency.*

The same can be easily applied to the other group if you bothered to follow what has been going on in that region for 70+ years. Hamas are brutal terrorists but you cannot pick and choose one barbaric action over the other."
Bravo.
"Add to this, denying the events took place"
The problem is there is a lot of Canadian citizens that support this as well
"What about celebrating or honouring Israel terrorizing Gaza in response?

Should they be expelled and deported? 

Before you get whiny I am Jewish."
"Can we deport and expel proponents of an apartheid regime, and put embargoes on a country that is literally murdering thousands of people PER DAY through their criminal actions?"
"Should we also deport anyone who supports Israel actions ? 
Israel is doing the same thing for decades. 
I’m fine with either decision, it should be consistent. 
Add to it, anyone cheering Iraq invading…"
Too many words for today's Twitter-educated film studies majors.
"Wow, can you expand on this? Why were they celebrating exactly? I'm so confused."
"I recall Citytv or CTV getting reactions of Americans at Pearson.

The one that stood out was this middle aged guy that said ""we should nuke any country that harbours terrorists"".  

Luckily cooler heads in America prevailed... wait no.

The US Invaded Afghanistan... then invaded Iraq for ""reasons""... became nationalist as fuck, produced some of the worst jingoistic country music ever, and cancelled the Dixie chicks.  Took them about a decade to actually get the guy they were after who wasn't even in either one of those countries...  and when they did, it was all to a wet fart because at that point it didn't even really matter.  

Hell I recall some people even questioning if they actually did get him or it was PR.

But yeah, right now we're in the ""nuke""... sorry ""Glass"" everyone mode."
">Israel as a settler military occupation.

That's an accurate description of Israel.  Facts don't care about feelings."
If you pick up a book you will realize they're not completely wrong. Maybe learn history from real resources and not reddit comments and Fox news.
">People using this as more villainizing of higher education are playing themselves and using extreme cases as the arguments, which is Politics favorite pasttime these past 7 years. What ever happened to the extreme cases not being representative of groups.

You hit the nail on the head here. The folks saying universities need to clean house due to the views of the few are also the same folks saying that the swastikas at the convoy protests were not representative of the whole thing, or that the homophobic things spoken by children at the ""parents protest"" a few weeks ago wernt a representation of the whole movement.

It's extremes ends taking all the oxygen and attention."
Not even. Its not the donors that support this stuff at all. The problem is literally the workers on the ground.
"Ya I agree. It's best to ignore experts and the media, I get all my information from anonymous twitter and reddit posts."
Universities do not have 70-80% international students.
generic statements against violence while secretly being as pro hamas as they come behind the scenes
With some statement of neutrality followed by a but.
It's not easy because often people can't even agree on the facts.
I don't know. That York university statement is scary.
Username checks out
"Debating complicated issues isn't the left eating itself, it's what's supposed to happen, especially at universities."
You love the fact that only one side contemplates the morality of genocide?
"I don't get it. Release a neutral statement like ""we regret the loss of civilian life"" and move on to do your jobs, which is to provide a space for education and research. No need to take sides on anything, it isn't a political entity."
Honestly cause we’re in an age where not having an opinion gets you crucified for being silent on issues. Which is incredibly dangerous and why we have so many institutions and people who no business saying anything having an opinion.
"There were plenty of protests about Syria back in the day, but the Syrian-Canadian community is much smaller than the Palestinian-Canadian one, and the cause hasn’t had decades of laundering to make it caché. There’s no scarves (keffiyeh) for Syria. Merch is powerful for virtue signalling."
"You can literally say that about any conflict. The western world didn't give a shit about Israel airstrikes in the past, Saudi airstrikes in Yemen, American airstrikes in Afghanistan, but all of a sudden, when Russia does it, it's now a problem.

&#x200B;

It's almost as if it has nothing to do with the atrocities and everything to do with who you align with politically. 

&#x200B;

Hell, some people on Reddit were frothing at the mouth at the thought of ""levelling Gaza"" and ""turning it into glass"", and other were cheering for that. Why? Because they are brown Muslims? They aren't on ""your side"" so I guess who gives a shit if 10s of thousands are about to die."
"It's not clear that this pulling up of water pipelines happens, or where it happens. There's only one documented source of this, which comes from the ICCT. Is it pervasive? Were they removing active water lines? We literally don't know if they pulled up damaged pipes for reuse. We don't know if the pipes went anywhere or that they could be meaningfully reused elsewhere. We have one video of Hamas maybe doing something one time with no context.

Meanwhile, Israel has bombed many many water treatment plants, water treatment infrastructure (including many kms of water pipes), and their three desalination plants.

So we have one unverified source with literally no context about rockets. And many many many verified sources of Israel destroying water treatment infrastructure.

Like do you actually think Palestinians look at what Israel is doing to their water infrastructure and see Israel as their ally??"
"Genuinely shocking that the overwhelming sentiment here is ""genociding the native population the land was stolen from is good"".  I believe that Islam is one of the most dangerous beliefs systems held by large numbers of people, but I don't advocate genocide because of that belief."
You realize Jewish people were there first and were forced out right?
Its a conflict that's older than most people here have been alive. It's not as simple as a single sentence.
So you cant stand with Palestine without standing with Hamas?

Ok chill. Students have always leaned very left regardless if they’re immigrants or not
Along with CUPE🤦🏼‍♂️
"When Universities try to appease certain groups, the level of education nose dives."
"> I’m sure they are trying to appease both the Arab and Jewish communities.

most international students i see coming to canada are from neither of those backgrounds."
"It's a complex and simple problem, really.

Both sides are wrong. Killing innocents and appealing to genocide is wrong."
Call for an end to the bloodshed. Supporting either side just means you want more death.
Umm all of the international students are Indian and Chinese....
I’m sure there are other people willing to fill those spots without an issue.
Could someone explain to me why this situation is considered ambiguous? Terrorists attacked Israel and now Israel has all right to do what they plan to do to eliminate the menace. It is 100% clear for me. What am I missing?
"That's the worst. And they think because they're educated in their field that makes them qualified to talk about anything. You're there for biology, stay in the proper lane."
There are police on my street guarding a synagogue.  This very much feels like it effects me.
"Yep. Very true. 

In the middle of a cost of living crisis, high housing costs, high heating costs going into winter, high gasoline costs are spiking, inflation, rising interest rates, economy on the ruts, people working multiple jobs, what is the number one thing r/Canada discusses: Israel and Palestine. Second most discussed is Ukraine and Russia."
"Yeah, it's ridiculous the media/schools pay so much attention to crap that doesn't affect Canada. Yet, they can never focus on their own issues at hand."
"My former high school had 3 random men threaten to bomb it yesterday, so I think this does affect Canadians"
"Undergrads and outsiders typically only see about a 3rd of what universities do. Less maybe.

Education is big, but it isn't the biggest part of the pie. Research is the most significant part of a university.

And yes, as you say, universities are communities."
"> let's bring back meritocracy too

OK, let's not go crazy here!  How would this ""meritocracy"" thing even work?  Give higher grades to students who studied harder and know more?  That's so problematic I can't even.  /s"
"Meritocracy has never been a thing. Humans and their institutions are always fallible, imperfect, and susceptible to corruption."
"Meritocracy is great if everyone has equal opportunities to achieve merit, but if you're not careful, the people at the top try to secure their position just like in any other system, but by tearing down educational institutions instead, to make sure nobody else can earn the same merits as them.  IE the people that got rewarded for being really smart don't want to be challenged by other smart people, so because they're at the top and make all the decisions, they decide to make everyone else stupider."
"You’ll need some very good tie-breakers because there will be hundred of people fully qualified for a few positions. 

I say prospective professors should have to bare knuckle fight it out for jobs."
Meritocracy has never existed in this nation except maybe in pre colonial times but even that is impossible to say.
Thank goodness universities don’t teach about politics/history/religion
It took way too long of scrolling through comments to finally find the correct one.
"That’s a dishonest reading of this situation — unless you think Palestinians = terrorists

It’s not even possible to argue this as the western world has refused to condemn Israel both historically (for the open air Prison they created in Gaza, treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank, and the hundreds of indiscriminate Palestinians they kill) and now…

There are no good sides in this story yet the Western world at large supports Israeli terrorists that harm Palestinians at large"
Must be exhausting nailing yourself to the cross every day.
"""Whoever is most outraged wins""

Wouldn't they be teaching conservatism then?"
"The irony of you regurgitating talking points of the American right wing is hysterical.

There as been no greater victim in the history of human civilization than the conservative male!

You notice all of the groups in conflict are conservatives?  Right wing Islam (Hamas, Isis etc.), Right wing Russia, Right wing Iran, Right wing India, Right wing Christians and Muslims etc.

If anything, we should be examining why Cons throughout the world need to constantly war and lick the boots of the rich."
">Whoever is most outraged wins

Wouldn't conservatives be winning then?

They get outraged over things like depictions of the visible light spectrum and the fact that gay people even exist. 

Meanwhile liberals are outraged by things like war and genocide and conservatives call them too sensitive lmao."
">A liberal agenda has encouraged Canadians to feel post-nationalist where they pretend to feel more aligned with their ancestral country than Canada.

lol no, that's just how Canada treat people in general and that goes all the way back.

We're not Americans that shove ""Patriotism"" and singular mindset to immigrants by bullying them.

&#x200B;

>A liberal agenda taught to hate “the white elite men”

lol no, man ... you ate too much QAnon cereal on a nice Friday morning."
500 years ago.
"It's not that difficult, universities don't have to get involved at all. Allow people to speak their mind (excluding explicit calls for violence), don't have an official university opinion, and discourage staff from sharing their own opinion. This is how universities are supposed to work."
Unfortunately when you're unbiased and actually do research you often come into conflict with the biased who've done no research who feel very strongly about the situation for illegitimate reasons.
"I like to keep simple rules for life

1. If what I say or do has a negative impact on someone else, don't do it.
2. You have the right to say anything you want, I have the right to ignore you completely when you are saying it
3. Two people with opposing views, can both be right, perspective is everything
4. Respect, integrity, trust - are my foundation"
Along with the S.S. Tolerance.
No it didn't lmao. Have you even gone to a university in that time?
"I actually disagree, especially so with the current state of academia. 

I can almost guarantee you'll find more critical thinkers in an engineering program than a philosophy program."
"And philosophy is the only degree program in the humanities which actually teaches critical thinking, in my personal experience.

If you really want to learn critical thinking, however, take a science degree. Fuzzy thinking doesn't work when you can directly test your conclusions against reality. There's nothing like spending a week working through a problem only to have your experiment prove you wrong to teach you to not make logical mistakes in your reasoning.

Other than the hard sciences, only mathematics and philosophy also correctly teach critical thinking, because those are the only programs which approach critical thinking with sufficient rigor in the absence of empirical experimentation. And philosophy only does so barely."
It's naturally occurring among smart people. Critical thinking have existed millenia before universities where invented.
"Honestly if is their opinion on university, there's a good chance they didn't go to school. Even in my undergrad, the primary foundation that I learned was critical thinking that got helped me through grad school and advancing my career in the private sector."
Spoiler alert: most of the people bitching about universities have never went to one.
"You have no understanding of my education nor my views.

The institution needs to focus on its mandate, which should be education, not conflict and how it impacts their foreign student numbers."
OP or the public that wants a position on this issue
There often isn't even agreement on whether or not a particular act is terrorism.
"Not if you have tenure, then you can act like a prick to everyone and push your fucked up beliefs regardless of political orientation."
the wrong people eh?
"So...you're saying now that because it's more diveres instead of being mostly Jewish, it's filled with the ""wrong people""? And because those people are against ethnic cleansing (just like Jews should be) they're spreading hate? Take a cold shower and go outside."
">I guess I don’t have much to say about that except to note that academics tend to say things like, “we must stop the cycle of violence”, but they always seem to say it the loudest after a bunch of Jews have already been killed. How about we break that cycle before all the Jew killing?

whoa whoa whoa, let's not do anything too radical!"
It's pretty sickening what's going on in Ontario universities.  My niece was absolutely appalled at the biased anti-israel rhetoric to the point where she felt personally threatened.  Everything is framed as colonialism and white privilege which according to the university - the Jews started.  The crazy part is that she was in teachers college and Israel had nothing to even do with the curriculum.
"Ok Hamas had a gamer moment, where was these supposed people talking about ending violence since 2014? Stopping the creep into Palestine?

&#x200B;

Can Israel just do one year without an airstrike into Syria or Lebanon?"
">vast majority of university employees belong to unions whose members often receive 4%+ annual increases

0, 0, .75, 1, 0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5 at mine.

Where can I sign up for the 4%+?"
"Most universities are non-profit, but have for-profit subsidiaries.

Case and point: University of Toronto has a business school (Rotman) which is for-profit and where tuition is 4x the other departments.

This is how they keep govt funding parts of the school while charging insane fees in other areas.

Edit: Rotman MBA was $45k per year a decade ago."
"I don't think you quite understand what ""non for profits"" actually means in practice."
"Holy fuck. Just seeing ""WPIRG"" written is bringing back some serious repressed memories from that time in UWaterloo. Nearly forgot all about it...

Which university?
There are certainly a lot of parallels but probably more so with apartheid South Africa.
"Was it anti-Israel, or anti- “discriminatory actions by agents of the state of Israel”?

Because those are very different things.  I firmly believe in the right of the state of Israel to exist, but also that the current government has made things worse and is in the process of making them even more worse."
"i forgot the part that the funding was pulled out through a student referendum, proposed by the pro-defund student councillors. looks like i mixed up the result of the 2 referendum, with the original referendum being much closer, while the referendum to defund resulted in 82% in favour.

the group ceased to exist, in [their website's about page](https://www.wpirg.org/about):

>WPIRG closed its doors in 2018 following a difficult couple of years fighting for our funding on campus. For forty-three years, an annual student levy of $4.75 per undergraduate allowed WPIRG to provide countless resources to campus, including staff expertise, a robust library, technological tools, a constant roaster of educational programming, project and research funding, and most importantly, a strong community.

"The difference is anything that is not pro-Israel is anti-Semitic in times like these. I understand where Jews are coming from, but it leads to so much division"
"I don't think the Jewish people's very well-documented indigeneity to the Holy Land is even the biggest issue here, as a canadian. Canada, unlike Israel, is undoubtedly a colonial state, the vast majority of us are not indigenous to Canada. The same ""decolonization"" rhetoric is popular with these people, and it's politically mainstream in Canada because most Canadians are rightly ashamed of how we treated the natives and how many of their communities still can't access basic human necessities like clean water. But if these same ""decolonization"" supporters are cheering on Hamas attacks on Israel, and they truly believe Israel to be a colonial state, and they see this as justified by decolonization, would that same justification of violence not apply to Canadian citizens?"
"Jews only ruled for 500 years, Muslims ruled for 1300 years. Before them were Canaanites who remained and intermarried with Arabs and adopted Islam and Arab culture. Canaanites were the true indigenous people, the Jews came and genocided them according to the Old Testament which is what they base they’re history on right? Their God told them it belongs to them so they went and conquered it slaughtered the indigenous people and murdered the men, women and children. If you support their so called claim then you support genocide and colonialism because they said their book told them. Therefor if someone comes to your home and told you to get out because their book told them it belongs to them you should leave as well. They were settlers then and settlers now with the weakest claims to Palestine. Even Romans held Palestine longer than the Jews. 

The Palestinians of today are the descendants of the Canaanites according to historians. They have the best claim historically and through rulership. To say Jews are indigenous is absolutely false according to even their own historic book."
">Not only do they say ridiculous statements like ""what did you think decolonizing looks like

Well they are not technically wrong and this sentiment has been widely spread this week on university campus including by professors"
Nobody is a slave… and if they were that wouldn’t be peaceful coexistence
"Sure you can. Israel, Canada, the US, UK, have all committed horrible atrocities over their existence.  I still choose to fight for them over Hamas, ISIS, North Korea, or the Taliban."
"I didn't say Israel was perfect, I said it's a problem when half your faculty and student clubs release declarations praising Hamas' 'resistance' when that resistance involves brutally butchering children in their cribs."
"Yeah except Israel isn't going door to door taking hostages to rape and murder, while students in canada celebrate those rapes and murders."
He's specifically talking about life on university campuses in this country.
Another issue with mass immigration of people who's values don't align with our own. Trudeau righteously paraded that we Canadians have no identity or values. We are simply a collective of different values....yet now we have people with these kind of views that we clear as day can identify as anti-Canadian. Go figure.
"The liberals are working to criminalize residential school denialism. They locked up Canadians at the freedom convoy. 

They have no compunction limiting Canadians freedoms. At least most Canadians!!"
Yes. We can have both.
"Who are you talking about? Are you spewing fake news about Israel right now? I legit can't tell, but god I hope its not propaganda lmao."
"Israel is not doing the same thing for decades. Collateral damage from a bombing targeting hamas is not the same as intentionally butchering citizens. 

It’s an insane moral equivocation to make.

I don’t remember any Jewish people cutting off cartoonists heads either for what it’s worth."
"Here’s a link of another story currently on the front page of this sub. I think it sums it up. 

[https://reddit.com/r/canada/s/YLRm7BM1Tx](https://reddit.com/r/canada/s/YLRm7BM1Tx)"
"Oh god the lack of knowledge here…. 

Here we go. 

Jews and Muslims always resided in the lands of Israel and Palestine as we know them today. They were invaded and conquered by many empires such as the Assyrians, Babylonians and the Persians along with many others. It wasn’t until the Roman Empire conquered Israel and Palestine and drove the Jews out of Israel. 

Palestine and Israel remained under Roman control until the Muslims fought back and defeated the Roman Empire. It was at this point Muslims claimed Israel as apart of Palestine. Fast forward through history and Muslims legally sold the land that is now the state of Israel to the Ottoman Empire. 

The Ottoman Empire was abolished after world war 1 which then legally left the state of Israel in the hands of Britain. 

Britain then decided a peaceful option to both the jews and Muslims, is that Palestine would belong to the Muslims and Israel belonged to the jews. The Jews accepted and the Muslims did not. The Muslims refused to accept israel as a state and then proceeded to start a war that is the same one you are seeing today. 

In short, the Hamas are mad about Jews living on land that they legally sold to another empire. The Muslims hate Jews because of religion differences and the proof is in the fact that they didn’t care about that land when they sold it to the Ottoman Empire, they only cared when Jews got it back.

Even besides the legal land ownership, the Jews always resided in Israel from the start."
Except that Israelis are indigenous to Israel.  It'd be like if the Europeans kicked out the First Nations peoples and then hundreds of years later they came back.
lol.

That’s the issue to fix I think.
"I actually read it out loud to my SO and they said WTF it sound like something Hitler would have said. Think about this it was released yesterday they had days to refine this, so think about what they really want to say"
Hamas calls for global jihad to kill or subjugate all non-Muslims
"What genocide?

As far as I am aware only one side has genocide explicitly listed as one of their government's goals. Fortunately they have not been able to realize it, yet."
"Genocide?

You realize that there's 14.3 million Palestinians in the world, if which 2.2 million live in Gaza, 456 million Arabs, and only 16.1 million Jews, right?

20% of the population of Israel is Muslim and are higher paid, better educated, healthier, etc. than the terrorists in Gaza.

Sure their are Palestinians in Gaza that are not Hamas supporters. They should do one of two things:

1) denounce/condemn Hamas and help Israel find this terrorist organization, and/or
2) exit the country south into Egypt

The fact that they aren't doing this tells you everything."
This is a new account made to just talk about the terrorist attacks on Isreal.
"It's a conflict happening on the other side of the world, has been going on for decades, and nothing we or universities here do will have any influence on it at all.

There is no point even commenting on it, or picking a side."
"It’s wild. Like I 100% get wanting to offer support to students and faculty but I feel like they need to keep shit way more neutral in a lot of these complex political issues. Condemn violence against citizens absolutely, but publicly taking sides is absolutely wild for an institution or business to do in this situation."
"And how many of our progressives and illiberal liberals were out there or even on here denouncing Syria and Russia for what they were doing? How many university student associations denounced it? 

I think much of it is due to, as one columnist put it this morning "" radical-chic antisemitism that masquerades in the guise of “left-wing” anti-Zionism."""
"Bingo. 

As I pointed out above,  the Jewish people were forced out of Egypt...  are they going to roll into Cairo and start seizing property,  and giving it a vacation homes to families from new York? 

Because that's factually happening in Palestine"
"1300 years ago. The Palestinians are also people that had lived there for thousands of years, many of them descendants of the people who remained when the Jews were forced out."
"Not one single Israeli family has been there for over 90 years.  

None.... zero. 

Do the Danish have a claim to England?    Do the Russians have a claim in ukraine?     Does turkey have a claim to Egypt?   

On that note,  weren't the Jewish people forced out of Egypt?    Do they have the right to kick Egyptians out of their homes by gun point? 

The Jewish people have a horrific history that they DO NOT deserve.   

All the more reason they should not be treating others the way they are."
"Actually, Egypt was there first."
Lol did Jordan Peterson teach you this?
"To me, yes."
Left leaning students are saying “this is gross but Palestinian civilians are not responsible for this”.  Unhinged brainwashed immigrants are screaming that Hamas did nothing wrong and decolonizers deserve death to the last baby
Chill as snowman it’s just the truth

Progressivism is more important than  education /s
Too late.
"They're not discussing any educational or instructional content (which, at major universities, is at the discretion of individual instructors, not the university), but public statements: press releases, emails, tweets."
Bingo.
Universities: Don't appease. Discuss important topics.
"There are a shit tonne of international students at Canadian universities who are from these backgrounds. Maybe not specifically from Israel and Palestine, but there are a lot of Middle Eastern students who study in Canada. Iran, Saudi Arabia, UAB and all around that area. All of those countries also very much have opinions on this conflict."
"Depends on the year I find.   

This year is heavy on students from India,  in past decades it's been chinese, serbian/croatian and one year in particular I was seeing full on heavy conservative muslim students - like, enough to make me wonder wtf was going on.   They even had their wives following 5 paces behind.  

I'll admit that kinda cheesed me off."
"I see all sorts of different backgrounds. 

Just curious, how do you tell when someone is Arab or Jewish?"
"You really don’t know anything about the conflict if you try and simplify it like that. 

That’s what Israel hopes you do as it justifies their theft."
Really? This seems racist considering how wrong it is.
"You can watch videos on YouTube if you want an in-depth history “lesson”. I’m happy to recommend one if you would like. 

Here is a summary:

In the 1800’s there were some wealthy European Jewish people who got this idea that the Jews needed somewhere to call home in order to protect them and their families from hate. They felt like the best place for this was their Holy Land since their people had lived there thousands of years ago. This is known as the Zionist movement. In the early days they scouted the region and came back to report that there were many people living there and that it was not an empty desert. That these people would likely fight to keep their land. So they decided it was best to start by purchasing land that they could and building Jewish centers. Then they started developing residential areas. This was the strategy up until WW1. 

In WW1 the British and the French persuaded the Arabs who lived in the Middle East to fight with them against the Ottoman Empire who ruled the Middle East. In exchange for this, the British/French promised to give Palestine to the Arab people who lived there already and Britain took Iraq and I forget what France got. Either way, they divided up the land. Later in the war, Britain and France were losing the war and needed support from the Americans. One of the ways the obtained this was by appeasing those wealthy Jewish Zionists to put pressure on the US. This worked and the US joined. In exchange the my promised the Zionists they would have the same land they promised the Arabs. Long story short, they officially gave it to the Jews and they created Israel. 

For a long time the Arabs were holding on to their homes but in the 1940’s after WW2 the Israeli government increased their tactics on pushing out the Arabs to make way for the Jewish refugees and settlers. In the 1960’s the US decided they needed to increase their military presence in the Middle East and starting heavily funding the Israeli army. Well, they used this army to terrorize the Palestinian people to flea. For many years the world and both Israel and Palestine had agreed on a peace deal but the US vetoed it. 

For the last 30 years or so there has been a battle between the Palestinian people in Gaza and Israeli government. In 2005, the Jewish people were forced to leave Gaza by Israeli government and then they put up the fences and blocked all the people in. Then they had the elections where Hamas won. The existing government opposed but it was verified to be a fair and valid election and result. The West Bank is still run by the previous government and Gaza is run by Hamas. 

Israel is doing everything they can to drive Palestinian people out of Israel. It’s in their charter that they need Jews to be the majority of the population. Palestinian people are not going easily, as was warned 150+ years ago when this Zionist movement began."
"Here is a summary posted in coolguides:

"I find it's a common theme among most of the academic community.

I've had a few jobs at the university working for different professors doing data collection for various research papers.

What I've come to realize is that for the most part their knowledge is really only deep in their field. There are a few I've met that are definitely well versed in more than one field but they usually have a PhD in their main field and a masters in their secondary field.

Anyways, I worked for economics prof and he was a brilliant economist but was a huge climate change skeptic and would always try to talk to me about it like I gave a shit, I was just tryna do my job.

Another prof in the agriculture department was trying to lecture one of my co workers on Healthcare, and the last one I had experience with was a political science prof who was trying to lecture me on agriculture. 

They were all brilliant people in their field but they also all had the delusion that they were also experts in other fields. Not every prof is like this but I feel it's more common than not."
"We used to live by a synagogue in hje nations capital, and it was vandalized on a regular basis."

"If isreal-hamas conflict was in an am I the asshole sub reddit.

This is one of those ESH for me. I'm not arguing with anyone. Everyone sucks. I'm going to focus on the things that I can influence and matter here at home. 

I don't think we should be sending Isreal or hamas anything. Criminals everywhere in this situation.
Closely monitored humanitarian stuff, can't argue with that.

Comparing any of that with what's going on in Ukraine to this is asinine to me. One pretty clear who's wrong. The other is just a giant clusterfuck.

Ultimately though, we as citizens of Canada should be more focused on a plethora of domestic problems. As much as politicians would like to divert the gaze"
"Unfortunately ""studied harder"" is not the definition of meritocracy at all. But the performance on exams and assignments.

If you haven't learned this lesson now learn it quickly because out there in the ""real world"" capitalism does not automatically reward hard work. You can work your ass off and achieve nothing. That is the conceit of a market. You have to actually create value.

"Because I said what?

My point is regarding politically charged state of universities. 

The fact you alluded to Jesus Christ comedically should have you expelled /s

Trudeau’s words
Canada is to be the first post national state

https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/04/the-canada-experiment-is-this-the-worlds-first-postnational-country"
Let’s not minimize: thousands marched in support of terrorism against settler colonialism… CANADA IS A SETTLER COLONIAL COUNTRY. Believe then. Deport them.
A lot of schools banned conservative speakers.
"What are you talking about? 

The irony is you resorting to dividing people into warring tribes that we can’t share similarities. Just like universities becoming “political think tanks”

I’m liberal. I’m not promoting a war. Just try to say both sides are wrong publicly at an Canadian university and you’ll be accosted day and night"
"liberals get outraged by microaggressions and people wearing clothes or hair styles or making food they feel is 'cultural appropriation'. They get outraged by statistical differences in outcomes between different ethnic, racial, cultural or gender groups despite those groups having wildly different personalities, preferences and values. They get outraged if someone tells a joke they interpret as demeaning or offensive to any particular protected identity group. Outrage seems to be the permanent state of liberals in this day and age."
"Not at universities. Which we are talking about. 

I’m liberal. But the opinions going around are so far field. Some Canadian universities have black only lounges."
You are generalizing a group of people
"You support a system of fascist ideology. Yeah, I'm going to get outraged at your fascist bullshit.

Canadian universities need to be denazified."
"> Allow people to speak their mind, and discourage staff from sharing their own opinions

Staff aren't ""people""?"
That doesn’t really impact my core point though. Unless you are teaching physics (and even then anything cutting edge has differing opinions) you can still be teaching “bias”. Only reading in your mother tongue introduces bias.
"It depends on the department and professor.  Many Social Science, History, Humanities, and Communications professors absolutely have biases that they push on their students.  Most of them don't even hide it.  One of my friends' professors had a USSR flag in their office ffs.  Another prof had my friend write about how men are objectified in advertising more than women.  imo when it comes to non-STEM profs, they can get away with teaching their biased opinions a lot."
I have and I can pretty definitively say that there are departments that actively grade against critical thinking
"I have a PhD, I’ve spent a decade in post secondary institutions. And, yes, some departments have absolutely jumped the shark. The amount of activist opining being put forward as serious scholarly work is embarrassing."
I have and they absolutely have.
"You’re confusing, smugness with critical thinking"
I disagree because you said philosophy program. There are plenty of dogmatic bulls hit fields you could have said instead.
"I've met few groups of people who overestimate their ability to think critically more than engineers.

Y'all get straight C's, wind up with a decent career, and thing you're god's gift to the planet."
Critical thinking in what realm though. There is a big difference in sociological and engineering fields.
"No shit, engineers have to engineer shit that mostly works until the warranty runs out or they get canned, philosophy programs are a place where rich kids go for a degree so they can justify being an arrogant prick."
Not really. Martin Luther was excommunicated from the Catholic Church for teaching people how to read. What you say has no basis in reality.
"At one point I considered becoming a lawyer and I joined a prep group in fourth year undergrad for the LSAT. It was fascinating to see a group of humanities students struggle with basic modus ponens.

The LSAT is a trivial examination of **basic** critical thinking, and yet the humanities students found it extremely difficult while the handful of science students in the group found it easy. First year law school is just remedial critical thinking because humanities courses don't actually teach you how to do it."
"No, we just took STEM degrees and were disgusted by the humanities courses we were required to take.

Nobody in those classes could logically reason their way out of a paper bag, including the professor. Eventually you learn to just accept the pervasive fallacious reasoning and regurgitate what the prof wants to hear to get a good grade. The only humanities courses I ever took where the professor demonstrated an ability to apply basic logical reasoning were the philosophy ones.

The lesson I took from university is that almost every degree program where the veracity of the subject matter cannot be tested via direct experimentation is just complete bullshit."
"I mean I know you said

>Maybe universities should stick to unbiased education which enables critical thinking?

Seems like you don't want universities to

>educate people about history, how to make comparisons, how to study complex interactions, how to debate, etc?

based on the context of this article.  Or do you, so why would we exclude this conflict?"
Lol. Do ya see many Jews in Muslim countries man?
"These are the same people that go teach anti Israel sentiment in Canadian high schools so I’m not surprised they echo that sentiment in teachers college. I remember my hs politics class long ago was like that. They even got a speaker to come in from an NGO to basically say “Israel bad, Palestine good”"
"You mean confining people to an outdoor prison, cutting off water supply and electricity to starve people to death for the actions of a few isn't a popular thing to do? Who knew committing crimes against humanity was unacceptable?"
Sounds like a bunch of lies to me.
"Omg is she safe? I mean how dare they call out the apartheid state of Israel which oppresses millions of people and confine them to an open air prison for last 75 years. I mean how does it even matter those people suffer, she has all the reason to feel threatened because some people ask for JUSTICE!"
so York?
This is what free speech looks like.
Jews started white privilege? Last I heard we weren't even white!
"Dunno. Think Hamas can go a whole year without trying to kill any Jews?

Yeah, I don’t think so, either."
"When was that, I’m literally in UW and I have no idea what WPIRG is"
Probably York
"That makes sense for the West Bank. Gaza is sovereign .... ish. But Israel won't let them build military capabilities for obvious reasons. Arabs have full democratic rights in Israel and the plight there is more like other national minorities. That said alot of Palestinians want to go back to Israel proper after having been expelled. What they would do there is a question mark.

South Africa isn't the world's only anti-colonial struggle, just the last one and one of the more successful (in the 90s it was called miraculous, now people are a bit more mixed on it but it's still doing okay, way better for everyone than apartheid was, and looks like it will have a democratic transition of power). South Africa probably succeeds because some there point to Idi Amins and Mugabes of the world and are like ... ""yeah, that didn't really make our lives better"""
In the sense that there's a hostile threat at the border? SA is still pretty fucked up from the ending of apartheid
"Back in the late 1990s it was ok at York university to openly call Israel an illegitimate country and call for its destruction. These weren't  nuanced debates about secularism, or systemic racism.  

I'm open to criticism of Israel but have become very cautious since so many people tend to use it as a vehicle for blatant antisemitism."
"WPIRG is not an academic research group. They were a student-led and funded initiative.

Very dishonest to conflate what amounts to a student club, which falls under the purview of student government specifically because it is an extracurricular student group, with the good folks at Waterloo who actually do research."
"I'm Jewish and fuck Israel and it's atrocities over the years.  I protested against the government and their attack against the rule of law. I support a Palestinian state. Jewish people can take criticism of Israel and welcome open discussion.  It's when  people start being anti-Semitic that they call out antisemitism. 

I also think Hamas is a terrorist death cult state that must be stopped for the sake of everyone.  People who support terror as a form of resistance to colonization in this conflict are dullusional."
[deleted]
I think you're right with the contradiction you pointed out.
"Hold on hold on. You can't just say people who were there thousands of years ago aren't indigenous now because there were people before them. Thats ridiculous and nullifies the original premise that the palestinians are indigenous. Your religious accusations are pretty wild, don't even know how to respond to that. The palestinians of today are not the descnedants of Canaanites. There were barely anyone inside the land before the Jews started flocking there in the 1800s. It was just desert, but Jews started coming (their motivation for coming when no one else would was escaping persecution from russian pogroms) and cultivated the land leaving room for more immigration. Nearly everyone on the land now wasn't there before the mid 19th century since the majority of the population going into the 20th were immigrants."
Then I fully agree with you. I urge you to educate yourself about the situation in palestine and the conditions on the ground. It is quite objectively no different to French Algeria or apartheid South Africa. Nelson Mandela himself has came out to say this
[deleted]
"Im just gonna say that Israel's goverment seems quite fond of killing minors in the west bank even before all this, not even counting all the other human right violations by them in the apartheid government there.

Just like you I dont wanna defend either side and I don't believe that taking a one sided view will achieve anything  


edit: [https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/08/28/west-bank-spike-israeli-killings-palestinian-children](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/08/28/west-bank-spike-israeli-killings-palestinian-children)"
"Why does your comment feel like it's one sided?

Why does the IDF's "" right to defend itself"" involve brutally killing children?

Hamas is awful for doing what they did. But calling it a ""systemic murder"" is an overreach. It happened on Saturday and since then only Palestinian kids have been dying. How many [babies](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CyOR8AjOOjv/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) are enough to pay for what Hamas did? IDF is just as awful, if not a lot worse."
"What faculties are having half their staff publicly calling for this? I've only seen fringe cases with not a lot of support, and even fewer actually supporting the terrorism/'resistance'"
"Instead, they're just blowing them to bits with relentless bombings. What's the difference?"
"Except they have done that if you bothered to look at that region's history from any time before last week. If you haven't bothered to look at their history, you have no right talking about the present."
"But thats the thing, we don’t. 

We can play this whole game of “both sides are bad” but we’re giving political power to one side allowing them to get away with crimes against humanity.

Israelis are forcing 1.1 million Gaza residents to evacuate to the south of the city… it’s disgusting that we’re not just ignoring but actively supporting the ones doing it."
"True or false, Israel has cut water and electricity to Gaza? 

True or false, that's a violation of international law?"
"> Collateral damage from a bombing targeting hamas is not the same as intentionally butchering citizens.

Can you quantify how much collateral damage is acceptable?  I mean the scale of  collateral damage right now seems very high.  There must be a point where it becomes morally reprehensible, otherwise it's just openly accepting genocide.  And it's insanity to say talking about where that point is is ""supporting terrorism""."
Israel is about to ethnically cleanse gaza
"It’s fine if they do it by drones, F16, F35 
I bet if hamas has the some firepower, it will not use basic method of killing. 

What’s insane is to make 1 day of violence equivalent to decades of oppression. 

The only reason we’re discussing this is because some Israeli civilians are killed. And we’ve been turning blind eye to the thousands of Palestinians killed, tortured, deprived of basic freedoms for decades. 
Israel is occupying power and there should be no comparison between the oppressor and the oppressed."
"> Collateral damage from a bombing targeting hamas is not the same as intentionally butchering citizens.


Yes it is. Either way people are dead. If I’m a parent I’m not taking much comfort in “oh we didn’t *mean* to kill your child, it just kind of happened while we were doing something else.”"
"It's really not an insane moral equivalent to make. Palestinian civilian deaths have far outnumbered Israeli civilian deaths. Far, far, far more Palestinians have died. Make whatever moral justifications you want in your head, when your family and people are being slaughtered

They have also had their land, which should be protected by UN accords, invaded and annexed by the foreign power of Israel. Why has this been accepted for decades? Why is the default that they should allow this instead of fighting back? We certainly have no problem watching Ukrainians kill Russians during R's invasion."
One sides collateral damage is another sides terrorist attack and vice versa.
">Except that Israelis are indigenous to Israel. 

So are the Palestinians."
[deleted]
These are not universities.
"Well ya, but it's not easy and in some situations almost impossible to fix."
"OK, but we are talking about all of Gaza."
Interesting.  Sounds like we are about to have a debate.  Maybe we should do it in a place where we can gather people with relevant expertise and different ideologies.   Maybe a sort of educational setting.
"So if I punch you in the face everyday, but don’t write a manifesto about it, no punches were thrown."
"What I find so painful is that people in Palestine who don't support Hamas probably can't even denounce or condemn their terrorist leadership out of fear.  But these morons halfway across the globe have every freedom to voice their opinions, choose to attack Israel rather than Hamas.  If the international Palestinian community spoke out more vocally against Hamas and took their support away, we wouldn't be in this mess.  

But no.  They need add fuel to the fire so that more innocent people will get slaughtered while they can sit back and say it was the Jews and Israel."
">denounce/condemn Hamas and help Israel find this terrorist organization, and/or

What do they get in return?  Hamas does provide services.  Will the Palestinians get freedom of movement, an end to the economic restrictions, a right of return to go back to their confiscated lands?  


>exit the country south into Egypt

So eject them from their ancestral lands and send them to another place where they will have nothing.  Sounds very familiar.  What did we call it in the past when people who only migrated there in the last 70 years do this to the people who were living there?"
Yeah everything would be better for Israel if the Palestinians just left their home with no right of return
"OK, thanks for the heads up.  What do you get from it?"
Weird take but ok
">nothing we or universities here do will have any influence on it at all.

First of all, this is just wrong.  Canada supports Israel through trade, actual monetary support, and military support.  We are a democracy, so we do have agency.

>There is no point even commenting on it, or picking a side.

Exactly, we agree.  We should stop supporting Israel since both sides are immoral."
Like if anyone calls you out for not saying anything look them in the eye and say “great. Let’s have a conversation since you’re looking for it”. RARELY do they actually want to sit with you and do the hard and uncomfortable work of discussing geopolitical topics. They just wanna rage and you were the closest thing to them. Yawn.
"In broad strokes most people left of conservative were denouncing Syria because it was a dictatorship fighting its own people who were calling for elections. It was also more compatible with left ideals as the early days were disenfranchised youth pushed down by an oligarch economy, and farmers whose livelihood was impacted by climate change (Syria built too many hydro dams on the Euphrates). This was also a time where VICE News was indie and well-regarded by left-leaning people before they were HBO-affiliated and they were over there running around bombed streets with cameras. 

For conservatives, if they weren't finding brown people demanding democracy convenient or approaching the situation from a Christian compassion angle, the idea of Muslims killing each other was not incompatible with their views. Conservatives were way more pre-occupied with Syrian refugees. 

I too feel that anti-Zionism has become synonymous with anti-semitism in many ways, but it's unfair to act like people weren't upset back during the Syrian Civil War just because it didn't involve Jewish people."
"They have not been there for thousands of years. Right before the ottomans there was another muslim empire that ruled but before that, there was no muslim control of the territory."
What are you talking about? This is pure propaganda. Jews have lived in the area since moses brought them there.
"Bullshit there never stopped being a Jewish presence in the levant and the Middle East as a whole. Of course a lot of European Jews came, but you need to realize that a plurality of Israel’s population are Jews that are descendants of the Jews pogromed out of middle eastern nations. This does not give them a right to make illegal settlements in the West Bank but like let’s not spread straight up lies."
"Its quite literally the commodification of education that necessitates these outcomes, which is exactly why one of the most universal left wing tenets is to decommodify post secondary.

Do you really think university institutions are scared to step on toes because they have a superiority complex and wanna be seen as *""the bestest most progressive accepting virtuous people ever!!!""* ? 

Of course not. 

They're scared to step on toes because, under our capitalist framework, not pissing those people off is essential to keeping the money coming in. Universities are businesses, and they must operate as businesses when education is treated as a product rather than a right. And yeah, when the priority is the bottom line, the quality of the product suffers."
"It’s not even progressivism, although I get that is their attempt. History will not look favourably on this type of social behaviour"
"It's not just that, it's a large source of funding."
I hope that's sarcasm.
This is clearly capitalism in action
"Cuts both ways.   We have people screaming to not admit that the Europeans wiped out an existing civilization, then built a new one with slaves."
This.
"Progressivism used to mean anti war. They should be staging peace demonstrations, not picking a side. At what point did progressivism take a page from neocon warmongers?"
"They are inculcation centres and always pushing to build a society of zero tolerance to any opposing ideas and opinions.  They hate free speech and free thought.  They are actively pro-racist, supremacists and anti-semetic."
the entire palestinain and Jewish population worldwide is less then the amount of people from india or china studying worldwide.
Explain to me how it is rascist 🤦
"So, if we apply this scenario to Canada, does it mean that the First Nations can take weapons and kill civilians today just because our ancestors did many bad things years ago? I have a lot of questions for Arabs. Why other Arab countries do not take refugees? Nobody wants Palestinian people for some reason..."
I'm really not surprised about this. In the past I've personally felt like there was definitely an arrogance among some professors. Meanwhile I've met enough that were clueless about anything other than their chosen field and how they got through life is beyond me.
"It's ok we don't need to focus on actual anti-semetism when the CBC spent the  convoy protest calling protestors anti-semetic for making trivial comparisons between the loss of freedoms by anti-vaxxers to those of jews in 1930s Germany.

The same left wing media constantly makes trivial comparisons of anyone on the left to Nazi's or Hitler. 

The left and ""progressives"" have zero standards other than the double standard. 

They are trash and are enablers of the housing crisis and wage inequality by focusing on bullshit like intersectional analysis and GBA+ which equate to having the plebes fight over equal distribution of crumbs that fall from the masters table rather than focusing on actual inequality of the 0.001% that own almost everything."
Yes.  But it is scary it needs to happen.
Probably because Hamas called for global action and violence against Jews for today.
They are patrolling Mosques too.
White people burn mosques. Muslim people burn synagogues.
They are.
">These are massive global conficts. So for a sub at the national level, yes that is exactly what you get; geopolitics

There's lots of ways to work your ass off and achieve nothing. I recommend digging holes and filling them back in."
"The biggest stumbling block with a meritocracy, no matter how implemeneted, is going to be issues with which groups have merit, and why they do.

It's not going to be a shock to find that historically disadvantaged groups possess less hiring merit on average and denying them opportunity because of it is only going to deepen the problem."
What does that have to do with my comment.  the person stated bring back meritocracy.  When was meritocracy a thing ?  If were bringing it back it must have been a thing or do we use different dictionaries?
"Pre colonial times was referring more to native peoples however even then there were so many different groups if meritocracy did exist it was almost certainly rare.  Hereditary chiefs existed after all, even then the class system ruled."
Holy shit. I can't believe what I just read. What is wrong with these people
"This should surprise no one. 

York is a radical university, that consists of people who couldn't get in elsewhere. 

That being said, their opinion means nothing, nobody cares, and anybody who knows York would expect nothing less. 

That their Student Federation is extremely vocal for Palestine should he no surprise, as its Student Federation exists for mainly that reason. 

This student union speaks for a vocal minority. 

Their large Asian student population seem to be more neutral then anything. 

Too busy trying to get an education, then trying to find out more ways they have been oppressed. 

Ignore York. 

Just like employers do."
"""So-called Israel""? Its really called ""Israel"", I can assure you of that. 

I really didn't think I'd read a statement supporting the wholesale murder of civilians, but here we are."
"To be fair, you can't say it's universities who support this.  York came out firmly against these statements, which were made by student federations.  It's a group of students who did this.  Not the university."
"> York University Student Unions praise Hamas terrorists’ actions as “necessary” and condemn “so-called Canada” and “so-called” Israel as fundamentally illegitimate “settler-colonial states”.

> “From Turtle Island to Palestine […] these events serve as a reminder that resistance against colonial violence is  justified and necessary”.

these people should be expelled at the minimum."
"Ah yes but the call is also coming from inside the house at this point. How many have and still do scream we need to decolonize and liberate are several generation Canadians at this point. But of course the people that have been saying WTF do you think decolonization and liberate actually looks like where called conspiracy theorist, same with the ones that have been calling out the rise of anti-Semitism on the left"
"Has Canada continued the practice of forcing people out of homes so that their people can live there instead, or did we stop that a long time ago?

Which schools? Which speakers?
But when something like this happens its seen as best NBD at worst victim blaming and denial

I nearly finished a criminology minor before I had one too many profs that just wanted their opinion regurgitated back to them. People who pretend that there isn't a prevailing social dogma at universities (which will heavily punish you for critiquing it) is fooling themselves.

edit: I was actually reminded of my first year intro crim course where the prof explicitly instructed the class that they are not to engage critically whatsoever with any theories presented. Literally straight up stating that critical thought is not welcome. I think this was the lecture where they introduced two fundamentally incompatible criminological theories as being both true (lmao)"
Sounds like you’re still upset about the marks you got on those essays.
"Which departments?

Were they ones you in those departments or is this still second hand."
Where? What program?
"York Undergrad, BBA. Horrible 4 year experience. Within the business school as well as the humanities courses I took outside the confines of b school. 

Queens for my masters. That school was much better. However there were fewer chances to dabble in courses outside my specialization for obvious reasons

However the reality was regardless of political affiliation or field of study I was exposed to there was always a political bias. Like the real world. It’s not some sanctuary of higher education. You wanted to stay within those confines professors shared to get decent grades if it was anything other than an analytical exercise. 

There was no additional fostering of critical thinking that was any more developed than what I had experienced in High School or experienced in the workplace. Like everything there was a bias and within the humanities there was a clear political leaning where it was better to just not engage if you didn’t share the same opinion."
Philosophy majors aren't smug? LMAO
Economics 🤢
"Unlike most other disciplines, engineers are forced to deal with reality on a daily basis. For many engineers, if their logic is faulty, people die.

I'm not an engineer. I work with engineers regularly. In my experience, engineers are far, far better at critical thinking - on average - than basically any other discipline.

The most important thing engineers understand, in my experience, is that it is practically impossible to ""think critically"" about any subject of any complexity without quantification and mathematics. Verbal reasoning is too flimsy, and any logical error invalidates the entire chain of reasoning. Anyone incapable of doing advanced mathematics is incapable of critical thinking."
"To be fair, the structure of most academic programs effectively discourage critical thinking."
"That's the thing... 

Even straight C's in most engineering programs is a way larger accomplishment than anything in an arts program. 

Just looking now, an Honours Bachelor degree from University of Manitoba is 120 course hours.  That's 15 course hours a semester. I was at least 20% more that in every single semester, plus another 50% in lab time. 

So I really wouldn't compare grades here, especially when one degree has courses like: ""Feminist Philsoophy"" and the other has advanced calculus and PDE's. 

Now in terms of critical thinking... it's an entire field dedicated to solving problems. Don't really know why you'd discount that."
"I think it depends on how you define critical thinking. 

If I just go with the oxford dictionary definition:

>the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment.

So... let's look at an issue like ""carding"" that Toronto recently stopped. 

What do you think the common engineering view would be on that if they were objectively analyzing it?

We already know what the sociological view is/was."
"accurately describes the PHIL majors I knew in Uni days, lol"
"Nobody is doing a philosophy degree for an easy ride - the writings, outside of introductory classes, are some of the most complex you'll find in any university program. Not to mention according to studies which you can find yourself if you're capable of googling, philosophy majors are among the highest IQ students in universities, along with math and physics majors. Higher than engineering students.

Philosophy majors are arrogant pricks? You haven't met one in your life, and you probably couldn't identify a syllogism if it was irrefutably breaking down what a lazy, dull-brained hypocrite you are. You're a perfect example of why the cult of STEM is such an erosive ideology."
"Yikes, I love it."
"> The lesson I took from university is that almost every degree program where the veracity of the subject matter cannot be tested via direct experimentation is just complete bullshit.

This is ironic as it shows 

a) You didn't learn from your philosophy course the epistemological and ontological limitations of science/experiments.

b) You didn't learn from your STEM degree how to appropriately interpret evidence based on limited sample sizes.

c) You didn't learn from university how to form opinions based on more than your own experience and interpretation.

This is a problem with many students in STEM degrees. I say this as someone doing their third STEM degree."

"When silence becomes anti-sémitism, then that that is not true."
This is quite ironic
"I'm still not sure if it's a contradiction or a ""mask off"" moment. Calling Israelis colonizers is debatable since Jewish people actually have a historical claim to Israel. In any case, their claim to Israel is a lot stronger than non indigenous Canadians' claim to Canada. If this is ""what decolonization looks like"", if violence against non-indigenous people is justified by the concept of ""decolonization"", then I'm not on board. 

I'm 0% indigenous. My parents immigrated to Canada, I was born here and this is the only country I've ever known. I dont even have a dual citizenship, if I'm not Canadian, I'm stateless. If Canadians were attacked in the name of ""decolonization"", I would want my government to fight back against the so-called decolonizers. If that makes me a colonizer, I'd rather live with that guilt than give in to people who think I should be displaced due to my origin. Being indigenous or ""oppressed"" doesn't give you a carte blanche to do whatever you want."
">You can't just say people who were there thousands of years ago aren't indigenous now because there were people before them.

Huh? Indigenous means people who are the earliest known habitants of a land, and its not the Jews but the Canaanites who butchered them and settled there and attempted to erase their history.

Deuteronomy 7:24 He will give their kings into your hand, and you will wipe out their names from under heaven.

>Your religious accusations are pretty wild, don't even know how to respond to that.

Joshua Chapters 6, 7, 8 all speak of the genocide of the Canaanites. Here's a snippet:

6, 20 ""They devoted the city to the Lord and destroyed with the sword every living thing in it—men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep and donkeys.""

Joshua Chapters 6, 7, 8 all speak of the genocide of the Canaanites. Here's a snippet:

6, 20 ""They devoted the city to the Lord and destroyed with the sword every living thing in it—men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep and donkeys.""8, 24 "" When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai in the fields and in the wilderness where they had chased them, and when every one of them had been put to the sword, all the Israelites returned to Ai and killed those who were in it. 25 Twelve thousand men and women fell that day—all the people of Ai. 26 For Joshua did not draw back the hand that held out his javelin until he had destroyed\[a\] all who lived in Ai. 27 But Israel did carry off for themselves the livestock and plunder of this city, as the Lord had instructed Joshua.""

Deuteronomy Chapter 20, 14 As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the Lord your God gives you from your enemies. 15 This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby.

16 However, in the cities of the nations the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that breathes. 17 Completely destroy\[a\] them—the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—as the Lord your God has commanded you.

So you support this genocide because their book told them that its okay? If so, you should have no quarrel with anyone who wishes to evict you based on their religions book.

&#x200B;

>The palestinians of today are not the descnedants of Canaanites.

A complete lie. According to historians and geneticists that is not true. Illene Betty, a renowned Jewish historian said:

""But all these \[different peoples who had come to Canaan\] were additions, sprigs grafted onto the parent tree...And the parent tree was Canaanite...\[The Arab invaders of the 7th Century A.D.\] made Moslem converts of the natices, settled down as residents, and intermarried with them, with the result that all are now so completely Arabized that we cannot tell where the Canaanites leave off and the Arabs begin"" *Arab and the Jew in the Land of Canaan*

There are many genetic studies that show today's Palestinians are descendants of Canaanites. Palestinians are simply the descendants of Canaanites who stayed in Palestine, unlike the Jews who left.

&#x200B;

>There were barely anyone inside the land before the Jews started flocking there in the 1800s. It was just desert, but Jews started coming (their motivation for coming when no one else would was escaping persecution from russian pogroms) and cultivated the land leaving room for more immigration. Nearly everyone on the land now wasn't there before the mid 19th century since the majority of the population going into the 20th were immigrants.

This is a absolute lie. Palestine in the late 1800s was 85% Muslims and 3% Jewish. 94% were Arabs. By the 1940s Jewish population grew to 30% thanks to the Zionist settler movement and British support. Immigrants from Europe who have lived for generations. In the beginning many Jews were against Zionism because they believed they could not assimilate into Arab lands and felt more assimilated into the European culture. But with the rise of the Nazis, the Zionists worked to convince Jews to settle and invade Palestine.  As David Ben Gurion put it: ""—What Zionist propaganda for years could not do, disaster has done overnight.”

Ben-Gurion also wrote: ""After the formation of a large army in the wake of the establishment of the state, we will abolish partition and expand to the whole of Palestine.""He also wrote: ""I don’t regard a state in part of Palestine as the final aim of Zionism, but as a mean toward that aim.""

Theodore Herzl the father of Zionism wrote to Cecil Rhodes: the pre-eminent colonialist who colonized most of South Africa for England""It doesn’t involve Africa, but a piece of Asia Minor ; not Englishmen, but Jews . How, then, do I happen to turn to you since this is an out-of-the-way matter for you? How indeed? Because it is something colonial.""

All you've shown is fake Zionist propaganda and a distorted history that they try to represent and back their illegitimate claims. History and facts are not on their side.

EDIT: Lmao you can downvote me all you like, it doesn't change the history and facts as much as you hate it! The Zionist revisionism wont work!"
My goodness you are EGREGIOUSLY wrong on multiple fronts but I will not waste my time on you. Please do your research first before making claims like this. As a Palestinian-jordanian seeing people on the Internet say things when they clearly have 0 real knowledge of the conflict is so damn frustrating
No I urge you to educate yourself on why the conditions on the ground are the way they are. It’s called Hamas ruining it for everyone by taking any resources coming into Gaza so they can use it to plot terror attacks
"I can't tell if you're referring to the terrorists still holding babies hostage, the continuous rocket attacks that are ongoing in the north, or the terrorists who are still inside Israel."
"I love how we have progressed down the natural path of obfuscation wherein we are no longer talking about the large problem of anti-semitism on Canadian university campuses (and specifically the recent glorification of hamas' murder of men, women and children) and are now in a 'both sides' discussion.

I'm not getting sucked into a debate of 'who is worse', that is a path that goes nowhere. My original point remains."
This is fucking stupid. Jewish schools and community centres across the country are hiring additional security or closing for the day because Hamas declared a day of rage against Jews worldwide. This isn’t about Israel. Bad faith argument
"If you don’t think going house to house shooting men, women and children in a co-ordinated attack is not ‘systematic murder’ then I have nothing to say to you. That’s not “one-sided”, that’s a blunt description of what happened.

Hamas brought this on itself. I don’t like images of Palestinian children dying anymore than I like images of Israeli children dying, but what would you have Israel do in response? Hamas operates using children and civilians as human shields. They are openly telling Palestinians not to leave the areas Israel is warning them to leave. Hamas does not care about the Palestinians it claims to represent. 

Israel isn’t innocent either. I understand the operational needs to cut power and supplies to Gaza, but it is causing suffering for the Palestinian people. But none of this response would be happening if Hamas had not launched this brutal and unprovoked attack on Israeli citizens. 

But like I said, if you don’t count thousands of Hamas terrorists gunning youth down at a rave, we’re going door-to-door and murdering civilians in their beds “systematic murder” I see no point in engaging with you and I won’t be responding further."
But Hamas brought this on. Can't we at least unify in that?  Who attacks a country and doesn't expect a response. Hamas is killing its own people
"Intent. I can’t believe you people actually need this explained to you, but I’ll do it anyway. The Oct 7 attacks were **intentionally** targeting civilians. The IDF attacks are **intentionally** trying to LIMIT civilian casualties by not just carpet combing the entirety of Hamas territory. They’re only bombing buildings that have proof of Hamas or other groups using them for military action against Israel. 

If Israel wanted to kill every single Palestinian in Gaza in the next 24h, they probably could (or at least 99.9% of them, considering how densely populated it is and how well equipped their Air Force and artillery forces are, not to mention their nukes). But they don’t. If Palestinian leadership had the ability to kill every single Israeli, they would (as made clear by their charter, public statements, and actions). 

The Israeli civilians killed in the recent attacks were not being used as human shields for active combatants, they were being INTENTIONALLY targeted by Palestinian leadership. The Palestinian civilians killed in recent attacks WERE being used as human shields, and the Israeli INTENT was not to kill civilians, it was to eliminate enemy military that are targeting their country.  

This seems like obvious elementary school level logic to a non-Jew/non-Muslim outside perspective."
"Cool, I never said I supported our government's support of Israel though. I've spoken out about that several times in the past. Just like I'm going to keep speaking out about how shitty Hamas and it's supporters are."
The scale is high because Hamas launches it's rockets from civilian areas. If you launch a rocket from your house don't cry when your house gets bombed
"Get a grip. If that’s what they wanted they could have done it decades ago. 

Which is interesting because if Hamas had the power to kill every Jew at the drop of a hat they would do it. Israel would not do the opposite. 

I know who i want to win this war. The not terrorist side. Shouldn’t be that hard!!"
"Turning a blind eye?!?! Palestine has been given countless billions worth of aid by Canada and others. If that’s turning a blind eye can we have our money back??

Where is the progress? Where did that money go? It was stolen by corrupt Arab leaders. It seems like Hamas is the one turning a blind eye on Palestine. Not me."
Citizenship has nothing to do with ethnicity.
"Gaza is run by Hamas.  Hamas declared war on the whole world, but just Jews first."
I don't agree. There are Palestinians and Muslims living in Israel (20% of the population in fact). The difference is that those Palestinians are not terrorists and are committed to living together peacefully.
"All it does is spread hatred amongst people here in Canada, people who are not involved in it whatsoever. It's been going on since before we were born, and will likely continue after we're dead.

Why is it a Universities job to pick a side or even comment on it? If you want to teach the history of it, fine. But forming an opinion will only spread divide amongst people."
"We could stop supporting them today and it wouldn't change anything.

And yea, lets keep our money here, lets focus on our issues here, and not bring in garbage from conflicts that don't involve us."
"A lot of people can’t accept that a lot of these issues aren’t black and white, they’re extremely complicated and go back a long time. Like I personally don’t have the knowledge or background to make a comment. I don’t want innocent people to get hurt, that’s it."
"Muslims gained control of the territory around the year 640. But I am not talking about the religion, I am talking about the ethnicity of the people of Palestine (or even the bloodline, so to speak). They have been there for thousands of years, surviving wars, exile, Romans, Byzantines, Christians, Muslims, Ottomans, etc. And many of them do share common ancestors with the Jewish people who came from Europe. Their religion does not matter, they as a people, deserve to freely live on their ancestral lands, and that right has been stolen from them."
"Who said Jews?    I said ISRAELIS..


Amazing that you read one word,  and insert another.    This is a common tactic used by people like you. 

Israeli is a nationality
Jewish is a religion. 

Don't conflate the two,  to try and prove a point,  it makes you look ignorant."
"Also,  Moses didn't exist... that's a fairytale

If the Jews were forced out of Egypt,  why aren't they killing Egyptians and stealing houses there?    Do you think they should?"
"Hmmm it seems you don't read what I said,  you see what you want.    Show me where I said no Jews...   I said no ISRAELIS.......

prove me wrong"
"Thats, one way to look at it, another way is that conflict has and always will be kyptonite for the left and progressives and universities don't want to be labeled as racist or antisemitic."
"I think you are partially correct. It's true that income has high priority, but it's also the case that teachers at universities are mostly left-leaning. Identity politics to some extent, and political values make it so that a university values progressiveness. So I wouldn't say 'superiority complex', but more so shared ideals and consensus while discouraging deviations from those ideals. This is also why some scientists feel restricted in their research out of fear for backlash. It's to discourage behavior and views that are in conflict with the established ideals from the constitute. 

When it comes to other businesses, i do think it's solely because of the capitalist framework. The outspoken inclusiveness and progressiveness done by businesses is for appearance only, and not because there is a sincere ideological viewpoint that motivated progressiveness to emerge within these companies. This is fine however since businesses cater to its customers. So if a business takes progressive measurements it still signifies a positive societal development regardless of business motive, making it sincere as well as economically beneficial."
Everyone thinks history will not look favorably on social behaviour they dislike. Let's leave history's judgement to history.
certainly didn't look good on universities that used to ban black students and women  . . . . right?
"""progressiveness"""
lol
Who are screaming that we didn't? That was literally how human history worked before the 1900s.
"So the universities should just not care about PR unless it’s relating to those countries?

Also, Arab people exist outside Palestine."
"Just because you’ve seen a lot of Indian and Chinese international students doesn’t mean they are all Indian and Chinese. 

I personally have met loads of other Asian students, eastern and Western European, South American, basically every where."
"What are you talking about? The Israeli government hasn’t stopped doing the really bad things. It’s been going on for 75 years since 1948. The Nakba never ended. 

Go back and look at the history. When this conflict started getting really bad I knew I had to spend slot of time researching the history and viewing perspectives from both sides. I have way more Jewish friends than I do Palestinian or Arab friends, but I do have both. My Jewish friends are divided on this issue. My Palestinian friends are all in agreement they want freedom for their family and friends who are dying back home. Every one of my Palestinian friends has a family member or friend who has been killed back home. Not one of my Jewish friends who sides with Israel has a friend or family member who has been killed in this “war”.

I’m regards to Canada I would not support violence ever, but if Canada was trying to take away their reserves and the protests became violent due to our police or military using excessive force or tactics to remove their people, I would say they have a right to defend what is theirs. If Canada started bombing their schools and hospitals, I would completely understand if they responded with violence as well. 

That being said, I believe Canadians would never support an occupation against our indigenous people in todays time. The large majority of us acknowledge that our previous governments actively occupied and stole this land. Let’s say Nunavut wanted to secede and become their own nation, and some reason my vote counted, I would support them."
well said..
"Huh? They asked for people to join in the fight against the Israeli occupation & oppression, through means of protest or joining the war, they didn’t say go kill random Jews. To be honest if Canada is gonna pretend to be involved here they should be protecting everyone at danger"

They also used so-called Canada my SO said it sounded like Hitler wrote it
"No nuance, no critical thinking. It’s absolutely not a statement in support of killing civilians (but also…what do people think happens in war?!).

Re: the “so-called” — that’s a practice used globally to call attention/question to settler colonial states. You may hear people say “so-called Canada” in a similar way, they’re not actually disputing the existence of Israel (or Canada), just noting that it’s the settlers’ namesake."
"It's the shit York University is teaching students that lead them to support a terrorist attack in which over a thousand people were brutally murdered. These statements didn't appear in a vacuum. The difference between the students and the faculty is the faculty have the maturity to realize that saying this kind of shit in public looks bad.

York University's faculty and curriculum needs denazification."
These people are too stupid and reactionary to actually realize that.
"The people that the students supported slaughtering didn’t steal anyone’s homes, they lived in internationally recognized Israel. You are confident that not being Jewish and living in Canada will save you, but Hamas pledges to murder all Christians and Jews around the world.

"which is exactly what the feds are doing when they allow individuals with more bankroll (or people whom have more opportunities and privilege than the average Canadian citizen...) to immigrate to Canada and purchase property with cash, pay 12 months up front in rent etc. & drive up the cost to rent or buy for people already living here, forcing them to move in with family or sleep in the car or street or shelter.

Is it the same brutal and violent colonization that was practiced here during our inception and has deep rooted issues that are still impacting things today? No.

Is it deliberate and blatant imperialized activity which forces people out of their homes and into basically perpetual poverty in favour of corporate shareholders and elites? Absolutely.

To think we as Canadians are impervious to the violence and hostility when our government has made zero efforts to protect citizens/civilians from extremist groups is what's really foolish; anyone with a pulse on the immigration system knows we haven't been prioritizing national safety for years, because our oligarchs need workers and people to rent their properties, or else the whole GDP collapses. Don't even get me started on the rise of domestic terrorists 3d printing stockpiles of weapons. It's only a matter of time before these groups conflict or conspire, and without adequate protection (military, RCMP etc.), well..."

You are generalizing a group of people

Disagree.  They should make a distinction between fact and opinion.  Putting forth a new theory in an academic paper is precisely “sharing their own opinions”.
"So, faculty shouldn't have academic freedom lest they offend someone?"
I was referring to universities.. professors….
"What do you feel is meant by the term ""academic freedom""? 

Bear in mind we are talking about universities, not elementary schools.  The students are adults and should be in a position to handle exposure to ideas they disagree with.  The ""customer"" is paying to be in an academic environment where ideas can be debated."

"In my experience, almost every department in the humanities. Political science was particularly bad. My favorite was when a professor in a political science course I took was misapplying a mathematical theorem to ""prove"" his point.

He gave me a shitty grade when I pointed that out.

The average political science student couldn't reason their way out of a paper bag and struggled with basic modus ponens. The only faculty which could make a decent logical argument was the Philosophy department."
You want people to dox themselves?
">if their logic is faulty, people die.

Except it's not actually logic that engineers engage in. It's math. Math is not logic. I will repeat again. Math is not logic. Math is a kind of an algebra which we choose, and the algebra we choose to work in has its own internal logic which we follow. This is playing the game on easy mode! The logic of an algebra is phenomenally easy to follow. No one is ever trying to play a sneaky trick on you with a given theorem! 

Sometimes an algebra generates theorems that are useful in the real world. But most theorems are useless or, even worse, straight up wrong in reality (see: Banach-Tarski paradox). Math is quite distinct from logic and even more distinct from critical thought. 

I'm a physicist. I also work with engineers and technically, am employed as one. They are, compared to other folks with a university education, somewhat worse at critical thinking, but their real downfall is their overconfidence in their abilities.

>practically impossible to ""think critically"" about any subject of any complexity without quantification and mathematics

Yeah, except, hmmm. Most things in this life have unquantifiable parameters and a while host of unknowns. This exact attitude I see time and time again causing people (physicists are very guilty too) to oversimplify things down to a single number, and reach, frankly, absurd conclusions.

>Anyone incapable of doing advanced mathematics is incapable of critical thinking

This is truly absurd. How the heck is familiarity with Cauchy's theorem or Bessel's functions, or the 4-colour theorem supposed to aid at all with critical thinking? 

The truth is, something like Bayesian reasoning, which is a very good heuristic tool to aid in critical thought and analysis, can be understood easily with just a rudimentary level of grade school math."
They don't but I'd be very interested to hear what you believe their structure is and why that structure discourages critical thinking.
">Even straight C's in most engineering programs is a way larger accomplishment than anything in an arts program.

Good lord, no it isn't.

>I was at least 20% more that in every single semester, plus another 50% in lab time.

Good for you. This means absolutely nothing. Labs aren't lectures. And you absolutely weren't at 18 hours of lecture time per week.

>one degree has courses like: ""Feminist Philsoophy"" and the other has advanced calculus and PDE's.

No, it just has the blowoff E&M course that's made extra easy so those C-grade engineers don't flunk out entirely. If you want to be taken seriously, make an honest comparison.

>Now in terms of critical thinking... it's an entire field dedicated to solving problems. Don't really know why you'd discount that.

I've met a lot of engineers. More than you probably. Technically, these days I'm even employed as one. If their critical thinking isn't dogshit, then why is the engineering department a hotbed for crypto bros and silicon valley worship?"
"The problem is that many engineering students may not know the proper methods and data to consider when “properly analyzing” because they have never been trained for that kind of paradigm. 

Engineering utilizes a very different “logic” than the “logic” of psychology and sociology and it takes very different training and perspective."
lol this is the _not_ smug response

So, why does Israel get a pass to commit criimes against humanity?"
"It's not self-defense if you kick people out of their houses, make them homeless, stateless, and deny them access to economic opportunities."

"Yeah. I mean. ""Research group"" almost universally refers to an academic one and they're all technically student funded because some amount of tuition is directed towards research grants.

WPIRG is a very far cry from Dr. Science's Cutting Edge Science Group."
Israel was a fascist colonial state before Hamas. They did ethnic cleansing in 1948  decades before Hamas existed. They did it again and again and continue to do so in the West Bank and gaza.
"Being Anti-Zionist/Israel is not Anti-Semitic.  


Anyone who brings up Antisemitism every time Israel is involved is just acting in bad faith."
"Can we have a civil discussion without name calling? I was replying to the comment that was about Israel. And talking about Palestinian civilians is not stupid. They're getting bombed since Saturday, no israelis civilian has been harmed since that day. No Jew here in Canada will be harmed. Hamas is a terrorist group and their beliefs are not the norm. Palestinian civilians should have your attention now to prevent more bloodshed."
"5$ this guy cheered on october 7th.

I remember when all the comments in this subreddit were saying that all theses people would change their tune once the Israelis would take control of the situation again.

We are now at that point, where theyre screaming ""genocide"" of palestinians after having celebrated mass slaughter"
You don't have a clue lmao
"> I don’t like images of Palestinian children dying anymore than I like images of Israeli children dying, but what would you have Israel do in response?

Not kill more children in revenge? IDK man that seems like a pretty easy call."
"Saying that the whole thing started unprovoked this Saturday is wrong. I know you've probably only started hearing about Palestine this week. But Israel has been doing everything that would trigger an attack for months and years now. And no, the IDF is killing Palestinians, not Hamas. Call it for what it is. Two terrorists groups against each other and the Palestinians will be paying the price dearly."
"You're delusional if you think Israel isn't intentionally killing civilians. They're literally bombing hospitals lmao, I don't see how that's defendable"
So these terrorists have the support of the civilians living in the houses next to where they launch?   The civilians can say no to hamas?  They voted for hamas?   Give me a break.
"It's a fucking mess, ESH. Reporting in the [Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/) and Haaretz clearly indicates that Netanyahu et al used Hamas to divide Palestinians and justify their security agenda. As someone non-aligned with either group - but horrified nonetheless - it's very clear we're dealing with two, hardcore militant parties that are completely and irrevocably wedded to the Abrahamic cult of an eye-for-an-eye. Israel is about to make this shit a whole lot worse. There is no end game here except an endless cycle of pain and suffering."

"Billions ? As far as I remember it’s 50m per year. Which is about to save face, nothing more. 
We’ve provided Ukraine with more help in one year than what we did for Palestine. 

Regardless of money, this is about whether we should stand against Israel actions or not. They are doing war crimes every now and then… 

You’re claiming we should deport everyone who stand with hamas. Do you think we should extend the list to include people who stand with Israel or not."
Religion isn't ethnicity
OK?  But the siege will effect all Palestinians.  There will most likely be more dead civilians than actual Hamas.  At least that is historical.
The millions of Palestinians in gaza are terrorists? Don't really care for opinions that can't even muster a single iota of empathy.
">We could stop supporting them today and it wouldn't change anything.

It could cause enough friction that one side would have to change what they are doing.  Israel without international support is in a much weaker position.  That could force Israel to change."
Maybe that's how we inspire unity between Israelis and Palestinians - introduce a third claimant who doesn't fall into either of their identities like Ozymandias kind of did in Watchmen

"York has always had a lot of problems when it comes to fights between Israel- and Palestine-supporting students.

However, the undergraduate student union (which has a lot of issues and complaints of corruption and election rigging) put out a statement that they would organize and fund disruption of any events other student groups had in support of Israel."
"Do you think that the profs all get together to discuss what they are going to teach?  They absolutely do not.

Specific profs in specific courses teach things, and students not in political science or topics unrelated to the event will not be ""taught"" any sort of ideology.  There's no time for that, with the content to be covered.  There may be the odd prof, but they're profs. There are weird ones everywhere.  Even that, though, is not enough to get a general student ideology.  Ask the students in those federations where these ideas come from.  It's not the profs.  It's not the university.  Is there are toxic culture in a few of the student groups?  Seems to be, yup.  But it's not because of what 'they are being taught'.  That's not how university works."
"The settlements weren't made on internationally recognized land, but they were made all the same. 

One group doesn't get to do what they want and then try to take the high ground when it happens to them. This happened because of decades of poor governance, leadership, and policy within the Israeli government and a complacent population enabling it. Their **elected** government continued the settlements, time and time again. 

I'm open to deporting those supporting Hamas, as long as we also deport those who support the Israeli government and their settlements."

There are lots of Palestinians living in Israel. In fact they make up about 20% of the Israeli elected officials.  They are integrated into the society albeit in many cases as second class citizens which is a huge problem.  

The west bank is Israeli occupied land.  Hopefully the Palestinians will also take that land back and form their own government and live in peace.   I reject the idea that Gaza is some kind of prison that Jews pushed people into."

"You're right, it's not, but it's also incorrect to state bringing up antisemitism accusations is acting in bad faith.

For example, over the past week we have seen a lot of 'anti-Zionist' individuals and organizations blatantly out themselves as antisemites.

Take York university graduate [student unions](https://twitter.com/Anthony__Koch/status/1712630622370550250), thetoronto4palestine 'antizionists' [engaging in modern-day holocaust denialism](https://twitter.com/AntisemitismCA/status/1712523210179129479/photo/1), York university 'anti-Zionists' calling the recent pogrom '[justified and necessary](https://twitter.com/AntisemitismCA/status/1712809975817347289)', NDP MPP Sarah Jama who  celebrated Palestinian 'resistance' and marched in a '[anti-zionist](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/sarah-jama-gaza-statement-1.6992654)' rally celebrating the recent massacre in Israel where children were murdered in their cribs.

Or take Mahmoud Khalil - one of the organizers of ['anti-zionist](https://twitter.com/AntisemitismCA/status/1712466030591893869)' rallies in Canada -who posted an image of a Hamas gunman:“My beloved brother, son of strength. You always hoped and led toward this, and what an achievement from your sincerity of intention"" and [this vile trash](https://twitter.com/AntisemitismCA/status/1712466041971081366) making light of the murder of 40 Israeli babies.

Or How about McGill's '[anti-zionist](https://twitter.com/Anthony__Koch/status/1712302673767383105)' student unions saying 'a population under siege and occupation has no other option but to resist' (after the slaughter of over 1200 Israeli civilians, saying the 'hold the Israeli government fully responsible for the escalation of violence'.

Or how about the ['anti-Zionist](https://twitter.com/shuvmajumdar/status/1712170112441045046)' rally in calgary where people shouted 'Mahmoud Khalil leads a celebratory chant of “We are your men, Mohammad Deif!” Deif is the supreme military commander of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas.

Or [this lovely gentleman](https://twitter.com/AntisemitismCA/status/1712072336516485184), also present at the nathan philips square 'anti-zionist' rally.

So yeah, not all 'anti-zionists' are antisemites, but when you find antisemites, a lot of them tend to be situated in that camp. It's what lefties refer to as a 'dog whistle', and it's the modern day version of blood libel."
"It's the classic victimhood card.  Then they start with the numbers of Palestinian deaths over the years (which never separate civilians from militants).  They never look at the 20k rockets launched over the years, the constant terrorist attacks, the reneging on peace agreements, rejection of any negotiations.  Take some responsibility for once and get your shit together."
"> 5$ this guy cheered in october 7th

What makes you think that? I'm genuinely curious."
Great response.
"You know that Palestians have launched 20k rockets into Israeli cities, that also includes the terrorist attacks, reneging of peace agreements, calling for Israel to be wiped off the map, and rejecting any calls for a two state solution.  

Hamas also uses Palestinians as human shields.  Shit they are literally telling Gazans NOW to stay in their homes. But your blind hatred of israel is so powerful that you can't even admit to the Palestinians having any responsibility."
Hamas was elected so yes. Also what would you have the response be?
"> Billions ? As far as I remember it’s 50m per year.

If you read closely I said ""AND OTHERS"" not just Canada.

>Do you think we should extend the list to include people who stand with Israel or not.

No. I don't think Israel has done anything wrong.

It is very important to try to minimize civilian casualties. All I said was, the death of someone in a bombing living the floor above a hamas HQ is not the same as Hamas storming into Israel and intentionally shooting children. Its not even close to the same."
40 billion in the last 30 years. The highest per capita foreign aid in the entire world. Makes you wonder where all that money ended up?
I know that.  Israeli Jews are an ethnicity though.
"Hamas needs to be wiped out. 

Civilians need to get out of the way. 

Israel cannot go in with kid gloves. They should not put their own army at risk. 

Hamas has already inspired a terrorist in France to murder. I hope that is the last for today."

"How is progressivism the issue here? People are always gonna have opinions on issues. Its quite literally the commodification of education that allows any of it to effect objective education. 

Universities don't give a shit about virtue for virtue's sake. They're not people. They don't derive pleasure from doing virtuous acts. They're a business, because post secondary is a commodity. They derive pleasure from getting money. 

The only reason they are ""having issues navigating"" this is BECAUSE the survival of these institutions under a capitalist system that refuses to support universally free education can't survive without these parties patronizing them. If they piss off too many people the doors close because they won't have the money to run without tuition fees from students or some form of nationalization. The funniest part is, if the progressive view were followed, money wouldnt have a say and this would be a non-issue, everyone could just get on back to class and actually study objectively."
"You’re right, it was easy to find the stats. Indian and Chinese students make up just under 60% of international students.

"Why infer things that aren’t said? Obviously killing civilians is egregious, I don’t think that’s being denied here. Respectfully, as tragic as it is and as much as I feel for families and communities who lost/are losing loved ones, and babies who will never know their parents, civilians are tortured and killed during wars (by the good and bad guys) all the time. It’s frustrating to see this positioned as an anomaly.

If what you’re really taking issue with is the “resistance” to the “setter colonialism apartheid state”  I sincerely hope you didn’t wear an orange shirt two weeks ago. 

Pointing out oppression at the hands of the Israeli government and military isn’t antisemitic nor am I denying that bad actors are and will continue to use this conflict to leverage antisemitism. No resistance will ever be acceptable and doing nothing isn’t going to liberate Palestine but it will continue to drag out the genocide that is being committed against them. Again, I, you, and everyone else can have all the feelings and opinions under the sun about what Hamas should or shouldn’t do and we most certainly  should speak and act loudly against resistance being synonymous with antisemitism. But at some a point, it needs to be acknowledged that a terrorist organization is the natural outgrowth of 50+ years of suppression. I’m not sure what people expect Palestinians to do, other than to act out of rage and desperation. Expecting them to accept the current situation is…well, delululu, so no matter what, they lose."
"That just says you live in a fantasy land. We're talking about people justifying slaughtering canadians because they arent muslim or because they live on first nations land.

"I literally hold a degree in math. 

Math is very distinct from logic. You can deny it but your denial doesnt change plain and simple fact. One very big hint is that logic is primarily taught in philosophy class and not math class. Another big hint is that we use different words to describe these very different fields of study. The final big hint is that you say math is ""rooted"" in logic. Trees are rooted in the soil. Yet they are quite distinct from soil!

Math is a tool which can sometimes be used to aid logical reasoning. And it has its own internal rules of logic which can be followed to derive theorems. But math is not logic in the sense that you are speaking about logic.

>The Foundations of Mathematics is set theory and logic.

Yes! But you are playing a fun rhetorical trick here. One which can only be spotted by applying some free-of-mathematics critical analysis. The ""logic"" which mathematics is rooted in is the system by which we can build the rules and operators necessary to construct an algebra. We use ""logic"" which is something if a parlour game, to build a few simple rules, and then we keep playing within these rules to discover deeper and more complex ones. 

This is a rather distinct beast from the sort ""logic"" required to do any critical reasoning or analysis. In English, and any language I imagine, we sometimes use the same word to describe two very different things. This is an okay thing to do, even though it can be confusing sometimes. 

When it comes to being able to read a text and analyze it critically, mathematicians, engineers, and even physicists like myself absolutely lag behind the folks whose training specifically and explicitly involved critically analyzing texts. This should be obvious."
"Four hours of lecture every single day plus labs? Nope. 

You might be confusing tutorials, which are typically optional in engineering and sciences, for lectures. Worth noting that in the arts, tutorials are typically mandatory and make up the bulk of what we would consider ""lab sessions"".

I understand engineering was very difficult for you. That's fine. Most subjects are difficult for most people. There's a reason why grades tend to cluster around a 65. That you personally struggled does not make engineering in any way intrinsically ""better""."
Clearly you lack any form of critical thinking if you think that my statement in any way rejected the definition that you gave.

">But Gaza was negotiated land for the Palestinians.

Consider this...you've owned 10 acres of land. One part of the property has nice, arable farmland, with a nice house there. Another part of the property has a small woodshed.  People you've never met before seize the ENTIRE land.  They control YOUR access to the utilities, water pumps. Everything.  Then, after a few years of you being homeless, they say, ""we'll be generous.  You can have ONE room in the woodshed"". 

Do you think that's generous? Do you think that's fair? Do you hink that's reasonable? Israel NEVER owned that land. The land belongs to EVERYONE there. It was called Palestine. 

The only reason why the state of Israel exists is because Europeans were relatively anti-semitic post-WWII but were, ""yeah. Nah. We can't MURDER people.  We'll just put them over......there...""

Call the ENTIRE region something else.  A unifying name. Then, slowly disarm the terrorists, including Jewish Terrorists."
"Honestly, that's not a terrible solution. Seeing as how you lot can't play nicely, NONE OF YOU can have it. And we're going to make sure of it.

But seriously, if that was what he campaigned on, then yeah, anyone who voted for him would be an asshole.  

If he made that decision himself, out of the blue, then no I wouldn't."
And to also assume full responsibility for said government's initial  attack
"They’re always interested in breaking the cycle of violence— you know, *after* the Jew killing part is finished first, of course."
I honestly don’t which government you’re referring to here…
Pretty sure they've never not been at some degree of war with each other.
"The ethnic cleansing didn’t end in 1948. In the days before the Hamas attack, Palestinians were still being murdered by the Israeli government and settlers protected by the government in the West Bank. 

If it’s about kidnapping children, then as of the time of the attack, over 200 Palestinian children were in Israeli prisons where torture is common according to amnesty international. Hell most of the footage you’ve seen of kids in cages or fleeting were actually Palestinian kids. 

If it’s about gunmen shooting up civilians, look no further than the West Bank settlers that do it for sport and in the day before the attack, burnt a Palestinian child in a tent (the video of the aftermath is very graphic but I can show you if you don’t believe me)

And lastly the ethnic cleansing and land theft is obvious according to literally every NGO. Imagine you’re living in the West Bank. A Jewish settler can go up to your home, say they like it, and within a few weeks you have the army showing up claiming your home is illegal and set for demolition. They’ll force you out and some Jewish immigrant will get your home. If you leave the West Bank at any point, there’s a high likelihood you may get denied re-entry. There’s also a clear government policy to shift demographics in the West Bank. How is it anything BUT ethnic cleansing a la manifest destiny

Supporting the status quo or peace under conditions when a people are constantly subjected to war crimes is not peace, as you’ve stated earlier"
"Before they were declared a country they had already annexed and ethnically cleansed most of Palestine creating 600,000 refugees under britains watch during the British withdrawal. Arab soldiers joined in almost a year after it had begun as a response to the ethnic cleansing"
"Again, one sided take with no knowledge of how this conflict started. You refuse to learn or listen to the other side. This is textbook 1900s repeating itself. The occupied are demonized, jailed, dragged out of their homes, starved and killed en masse. And a blind revenge that will wipe out a whole country."
"I don't have time to go through my 2 week long Global History 12 unit on Israel and Palestine with an internet stranger, but I do have enough time to tell you don't have a clue."
"Have you looked at a map of Gaza? Did you know that it’s the 3rd most densely populated ‘country’ in the world? Did you know that Israel blockades their borders? Did you know that Israel controls their airspace, destroyed their airport and controls their sea space? 

The answer is “no” you didn’t know that, otherwise you would understand that there is nowhere for these innocent civilians to go."
"Yea bud, I'm sure they're totally having fair elections in a concentration camp controlled by terrorists and extremists.

2.3m people in Gaza and 43% under the age of 14. You're a callous idiot if you think they deserve this because of what Hamas did."
"Israel has done nothing wrong. Have you read UN reports, human right watch, amnesty international ? International law during war ? Right now as we speak Israel is bombing hospitals and ambulance cars, they are using illegal weapons. The land where those civilians killed is Palestinian land per 1967 convention. So they are being killed in occupied land, as far as logic goes, they only have themselves to blame.
If you deeply believe Israel has done nothing. Then, no matter what I say, you can’t change your mind."
"40 billion is literally peanuts in 30 years. 
Aid in a worn torn country literally get deprived within minutes.

Especially after every couple of months, you have Israel with their radical policies to “trim the hedge” of Palestinian if their population grew too much. Not much aid can get distributed properly.

It takes way more than 30 billion for a country to recover from 75 years of oppression."
">Civilians need to get out of the way.

They literally cannot because Israel won't let them leave Gaza.  Are you saying that we should put pressure on Israel to remove the restrictions on movement?"
"You're saying they should just leave or turn in the terrorists when most of them are starving children. Many of them won't be able to leave, many have already died and many more will die while Israel commits war crimes and uses genocidal language. If you wanna carry water for Israel while a humanitarian disaster that they have a large responsibility for creating unfolds then I don't even know what to say."
"There are several Jewish ethnic groups, like this is an objective fact, I don’t give a fuck about where you are from."
"I do not agree with illegal settlements in the West Bank, and I think they are abhorrent in how they removed Palestinians. But what happened in 1948 was that israel declared independence from the British mandate within their allotted borders, and then were invaded by arab states. Israel won. This led to expulsion of palatines in Israel, and of Jews everywhere in the Middle East. And then egypt annexed Gaza, and Jordan the West Bank. Palestine as we know it today only existed after israel fended off 2 more invasions by arab states. So, Israel is actually older than Palestine. 

To answer your questions, there are several Muslim theocracies, Vatican City etc…. And 20% of Israel are Muslim arabs."
"Are you kidding? Canada is a Christian country and so is America. There are literally 50 Muslim majority countries, 23 of which have it declared in their constitutions. 

Don't believe me, do you get Christmas off as a statutory holiday? What about Easter? You don't even realize how much benefit you get from being in a country that has similar values as you. Israel is the only place where the Jewish new year is a holiday. Where majority of the food is Kosher. When Fridays are half day for those that celebrate the sabbath. 

And this doesn't even touch the surface of the history of the Jewish people being exiled roughly every 150year for millenia. There is value in having a homeland."
"I disagree, many professors love to virtue signal, help them express their elitism."
"If only there was some kind of 2 state solution both sides could agree to, too bad one of them wants the total annihilation of the other based on their religion."
They said it. You just didn’t read it carefully
You are about as sharp as a wet noodle
"not the entire but the majority? If you voted for trump, and trump makes a dumb statement, looks really bad on you"
Are you new to words?
"The statement clearly words supporting the massacre while carefully not using words that would remind the reader that over a thousand civilians were butchered in a rave and in their homes. They could lead with that. But they represented those actions as ""a strong act of resistance"". 

Where I come from, brutally murdering civilians is not a ""strong act of resistance"". 

The whole response, and yours for that matter, conveniently ignore that hamas was behind it.

This is a very serious ask: what would peace look like? What would it take to have peace with hamas? They've already shared their opinion on that matter, its in their charter: they want to kill every jew. There is no version of peace acceptable to hamas that accepts the existence of a state of israel in that region in any way shape or form. There is no version of peace acceptable to hamas that accepts living jews in that region. 

The brutal invasion explicitly reflects that. So where do we go from there? I'd love to hear your proposed solution. 

FYI removing jews from Israel is a non-starter. We've had our shit kicked in by europeans and arabs for far too long. We have a right to live. We have a right to a country willing to protect us against mobs that would kill us in the street just for being jews.  If you can't understand that, there's not point having a conversation."
"This isn't just Palestinians saying they want their land back, **but their physical homes**. 

The fantasy land is believing this happened because of pure hate, and nothing else. Reality would suggest that the actions of the Israeli government led to that pure hate, created a breeding ground for it and continued to provide justification and reasons for that hate. 

It's not fair that innocent people died, but it also isn't fair that innocent people were being removed from their homes and killed. One terrible thing doesn't negate the other, but it can definitely lead to it."
"Don't paly dumb. 

When you demonize an entire group of people just for being born and want to pass laws prohibiting them from getting healthcare and taking part of society, what do you think happens?

When you call an entire group of people pedophiles and child abusers, what the absolute fuck do you think is going to happen?

A massive increase in anti-lgbtq hate crime of course. A massive increase in hate crimes driven specifically by conservative rhetoric.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/globalnews.ca/news/9393280/canada-lgbtq-hate-trans-west-block/amp/"
"Oh yeah, so hyperbolic. It's not like there's been a dramatic increase in anti-lgbtq hate crimes in Canada, has there? Oh wait....

https://www.google.com/amp/s/globalnews.ca/news/9393280/canada-lgbtq-hate-trans-west-block/amp/

But that's probably just a coincidence, right? Surely it's not the direct result of the hateful rhetoric spewed by every conservative politician in the country."
"Uoit. Mechanical engineering. 

And yes it did both English, history as an elective and introduced to pyscology as an elective."
I literally hold one as well and most programs require courses in logic as part of their degree and training is their degree. Maybe yours didn't. I don't know.
"Why are you arguing with someone whose actually done it?

We had 6-7 courses every single semester, most were 3's, some were a 4. 

And about 1 or 2 had labs every single semester.  Not including tutorial time. 

And fourth year obviously there's the degree project, which is listed as 3 hours but we spent two full days every week doing it. 


It's not hard to go look up the program outline."
"You seemed to think so highly of us, seemed it might add some sway to my comment.

Evidently not. Great job using that as an excuse to completely ignore the meat of my comment, however. Super fun rhetorical trick. Really lets everyone know that your priority here isn't in having an honest discussion."
"Thanks for adding your perspective; I have a lot of respect for engineers, and its interesting to hear how much ethical considerations factor into your work. My degree isn't in philosophy either, it just frustrates me to see it disrespected and I wish people weren't so black and white about the value of STEM vs non-STEM educations."
Jews have been living on the land for thousands of years - even before WWII.  It's a myth -  and pretty offensive - to say that Jews were just put there.  And you know what happened after the UN declared Israel a Jewish state - they were attacked. And then attacked again and again.  I agree that the 'conquered' land should be returned to the Palestinians and create a two state solution. But you're wrong in claiming that the initial land of Israel doesn't belong to the Jews.
"Most Israelis are from other parts of the Middle East such as Iraq, Egypt, Syria etc. They were expelled and chased out of those countries. 

But go on about Europeans."
This is a gross miscategorization of the situation. Israel was majority Jewish when formed and Israel has only taken land in defensive conflicts.
"Yes there was, pre 1948. 

Many Jews fleeing Europe during WW2 were actually welcomed and protected by Palestinians."
"Israelis left Gaza in 2005 as part of a negotiation with the Palestinians.  The IDF forcibly removed israeli settlers even though many Israelis disagreed with Sharon. Both sides agreed to this temporary solution.  

Hamas was elected in 2007 and has been launching rocket attacks ever since. There has been a ruthless back and forth which has resulted in more Palestinian deaths than Israelis.  Israel has responded by trying to rout out the terrorists.  

This is what has been going on for the past 18 years.  Don't give me this horse shit fairy tale of Palestinians being in a prison.  They have their own elected government and land that was negotiated.  That's why you don't here any shit coming out of the west bank right now."

"It was an internationally observed election you idiot they elected a group that openly declared they wanted to kill all jews.

Once again what is the response you think is right if someone keeps launching rockets at your cities. Just...let it happen?"
"It’s less than 1000$ per capita per year.
People claiming superior morality can’t argue with facts"
You're again twisting words. So I'm not going to respond further.
"That's why I was so careful to say ISRAELIS  and now Jewish.  
You are the one who tried to correct me. 

This is an Israeli thing.. not a Jewish thing. 

I agree the two are closely tied.  But that's because the Israeli government  refuses to have peace.  They steal,  they kill,  they arrest and imprison."
"To be clear,  Israel  did not win,  NATO won.  Just like NATO is going to be ultimately the winner in ukraine.  

These were wars fully backed by Britain and America.  
Obviously this whole region is an absolute quagmire, and anyone can find facts to support their theory.   But at this point in history,  Israel is occupying land that isn't theirs,  holding citizens that aren't Jewish essentially prisoner,  not allowing movement without an Israel passport ( which they take away from noon Jews, so you can't get through check points).


I'm not saying the Jews don't have a horrific past.  But that doesn't give them the right to steal someone else's homeland,  to create their own"
"The problem is not that significant, if you make distinction between Jewish nation and Judaism. Millions of Christian Jews  live in USA, and they don't suffer from lack of Jewish holidays.

On the other hand, living in a traditional country makes life only slightly easier a for serious believer.

A serious Catholic will tell you right away, that the state make a farce from Christian holidays, it's only a popular tradition and consumerism, nothing about religion.

E.g. every day of the Holy Week is more important than Christmas - good luck getting a supportive look for requesting time off on them."
But they stole  SOMEONE ELSE'S HOME LAND TO CREATE IT....
"So how many non Christians have had their houses seized in Canada to be given to Christian families? 
How many rockets has America fired into Jewish settlements in new York? 

Are you really comparing a paid day off ( even if you don't celebrate) to Israel locking people in an open air prison,  removing freedom of movement within a country and stealing homes in Gaza? 

That's the same to you?"
Agreed. Virtue signalling in universities is huge.
"I remember a certain Canadian university posting all over social media about how one of the teachers is a furry and how great it was they taught university classes dressed like an animal/furry.

I am all for progressivism as well but educational institutions' top priority should be producing the highest quality education, not appeasing people's emotions."
"Or, maybe, just maybe, they are expressing their genuinely held beliefs and it's actually possible for people to hold non-selfish ideals. 

Ask yourself why would professors, who have studied for years to become an expert in their field, feel ""elite"" for expressing progressive ideals? Why do we associate virtuosity with elitism? Is it maybe that virtuosity is something they see as worth striving for and respecting? Are they lying to students and manipulating their education to convince people *fallaciously* that conventionally virtuous acts are good and that we should strive to do more of them, when we really just wanna ""control the masses"" or something? Or are they simply arguing in favour of a better world that they see a path toward through years of exhaustive study searching for it and the evidence to support it's possibility?

People who ring the ""virtue signal"" alarm all the time are people who genuinely cannot fathom why a human would give a shit about something that doesn't personally effect them. To those people, being virtuous is hard, so they assume anybody living a virtuous life or expressing virtuous ideals must be doing it as an extreme and difficult labour that they engage in simply to ""be better"" than you. They can't understand it at all, because they themselves are so inherently selfish that they cannot believe people can just be good people and not act in some kind of self interest. A motive in a human mind, to them, always has to come back to how it serves the person doing the act.

Sorry to those guys, but the truth is 99.9999999% of the people who do what you call ""virtue signalling"" are actually just people who believe in doing right by people regardless of who they are, what they have or where they come from, and are willing to make sacrifices to realize a world in which that is the standard. Its not hard to be good. Its just hard for you."
"Hamas proposed a 2 state solution in 2017 btw, the same one Obama proposed to Netanyahu in 2011, the same one the White House proposed in January this year, based on the 67 borders. Obviously Netanyahu has rejected every 2 state solution since that’s not what he wants. He doesn’t want Palestinian sovereignty. That’s what this entire war is about or have you not been following

And I fail to see which “one” you’re referring to, since Zionism is fundamentally about annihilating all other religions."
Yea yea ok 😂
"It's worse than that, Netanyahu in particular was an architect behind keeping Hamas in power when he had opposition to both the left and right for that policy. But killing civilians is first of all illegal, but even say you are one of these students that says killing civilians is justified, how did this help? If you support this attack on the Israeli civilians, then you support the Israeli attack on gaza too, because everyone knew with 100% certainty what the response would be. 

For people that supported peace, I think they are thinking that now it is farther away than literally ever."
"I'm not playing dumb, you said they made calls for their execution, they didn't. You drew extreme conclusions and spouted off nonsense."
">And yes it did both English, history 

>pyscology 

Get a refund.

Anyway, it's very funny that you call their perspective ""lies"" while operating entirely on your own tiny perspective (three elective courses at one university). Take some social ""sciences"" courses and watch the bullshit flow. Almost every class I've ever taken in that field was just a pulpit for the prof with almost no room for critical engagement with the material. My intro criminology professor explicitly told the class that they are *not* to engage critically with the criminological theories presented in class."
"Yes. We cover some material. But if you want to get deep into logic, head on over to the philosophy department. Math departments tend to only cover enough to get people off and running with proofs.

Regardless, the point remains. Math is not logic. And logic is not math. They both hold similar aspects, and there is overlap, but especially when we're talking about things like critical thought, a knowledge of more advanced mathematics is absolutely not required and, often, not helpful in the least.

How does an understanding of ZFC, for example, help a person to understand when an article is written from a biased perspective, with only one viewpoint? As in all things in life, the only way to become good at something is to practice it. Critical analysis is not practiced by playing with mathematics, physics, engineering, or even statistics! It is practiced by taking texts and analyzing them critically."
">We had 6-7 courses every single semeste

Yeah okay. If you're doing a 21-credit hour semester (which I'm still skeptical of because I tried it once, it required dean of science approval, and was denied). Then yeah.

But a full course load is 15 credit hours.

Any art student doing a 21-credit hour semester is still getting the same hours as you. As you say, it's not hard to go look up the program outline."
"> using that as an excuse to completely ignore the meat of my comment, however. Super fun rhetorical trick. Really lets everyone know that your priority here isn't in having an honest discussion.

I did not evade anything, because i agree with you. So why argue about something we both agree on lol."
How and why was Israel formed?
"Hamas was strengthened by Israel to divide Palestine. This was explicitly confirmed by Israeli officials on multiple occasions. It was elected 16 years ago, what does that tell you about it? Would a representative government fear elections?

Israel is controlling all Gaza borders with only 1 passage to Egypt. And if you've been following events in Egypt you would know that Rafah is just another Israeli controlled-by-proxy passage. There's a blockade imposed by both Israel and Egypt. And Gazans aren't even allowed to travel to the West Bank (Palestine). The settlements have ramped up significantly in the past few months. I didn't call it an open prison, human rights watch did, the UN did. It's only a fairy tale because you refuse to listen to their side.

Gaza has been on lockdown for the past 16 years. It's only natural that people would hate Israel. That doesn't mean they like Hamas. I am seeing a lot of military aged men hiding with their families. They're not fighting they just want to live. What choice do these people have?"
"Not as convenient as you making up facts to suit your own narrative, but convenient enough."
"So the Israeli military kills 1500 Palestinians and then tells 1 million Palestinian civilians to evacuate gaza city to head north - closer to the heart of Israel which is planning to bomb/invade.

The UN said the mass evacuation in a country that small would be “calamitous” having “devastating humanitarian consequences”

You’re response is “but check out those nice hotels!”

Stay classy Reddit…"
"[The election was \_seventeen\_ years ago and was extremely problematic.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Palestinian_legislative_election)  Keep drinking the Israeli dis-info kool-aid though.

The response is it shouldn't be to indiscriminately kill civilians in their homes with heavy bombs.  They have no where to go, it's a fucking concentration camp."
You justify Israel's war crimes.
"My god read a fucking a book, the US only started sending aid after the Yom Kippur war. Britain gave tepid support to the arabs in 1948, Jordan’s army was even led by British officers. And, the soviets provided a massive amount of weapons to the Egyptians.

Also did you even read any of my previous comments? This situation is a so much more nuanced than you think, the only good guys are the civilians want to peacefully coexist, either in a 2-state solution or anything else that would actually lead to peace without more ethnic cleansing."
"Right but you clearly dont know anything about judaism. There is a huge cultural component to all of the high holidays even if you aren't religious. The culture is part of an ethnoreligion so it's engrained in everyone. 

And major things are also different too. For example, catholic private school is free in Canada. But Jewish school has $20k/year tuition and no tax reimbursement for funding public/catholic private school. 

Again, the kosher thing is a really big one which you glossed over. I wasn't raised crazy religious but I felt odd at public school and not always in place having different holidays and customs than the majority. The food was a huge limiting factor. 

All of this to say, every other culture has a homeland where they can be a majority, where their culture is supported not just tolerated, and where laws are written with them in mind. So why is it only a problem when the Jews do it? Why is it when every other country makes big political blunders or breaks the rules they are complained about but no one calls for them not to exist anymore? Canada stole the land from the natives, we killed them in droves very recently and no one is calling for the ejd of Canada. Trump was the president in USA saying crazy things, clearly corrupt, impeached etc and no one said USA shouldn't exist. But when Israel does it, it shouldn't exist."
"It wasn't stolen. All of the homes were bought and sold to jewish refugees after WW2 which was owned by the British after the fall of the ottoman empire. Palestine was never a sovereign nation and there were already very many Jewish settlements there.

The big misconception is around the 1948 war. All sides attacked Israel and it was supposed to be a complete massacre of Israelis who were the minority. There are two competing ideologies. One says that the neighboring countries told the Palestinians to leave their homes and come back once they won the war. The other says during the war the Israelis pushed them out of their homes. Either way, people fled bc of active war. And Israel surprisingly won and set up new borders to solidify their defense. Then the 1967 war happened and again it was supposed to be a massacre. But it wasn't, and instead they began the occupation of Gaza and the west Bank to prevent this from happening yet again.

In 2005, as a sign of peace Israel pulled out of Gaza entirely, forcing all the Israelis to leave their homes, and to leave the agriculture which was a main source of money. Gaza held an election and voted for Hamas. They destroyed the agriculture, and used Gaza as a fighting ground to regularly cause terror not just in Israel but also in Egypt. Egypt shares a border with them and won't take them in either. In fact, Israel offered for Egypt to take the land and expand Egypt, and they said hell no, we don't want them. 

So what is Israel to do? If they loosen their guard, hoards of terrorists invade and kill their civilians. If they give land back, it becomes a breeding ground for new attacks and the infrastructure is lost. They have been defensive this entire time. And yes, the ones suffering most are the Palestinian people. I agree, and I think the whole thing is extremely sad and fucked up. But we can't argue like this is simplistic when there are terrorist organizations actively hurting the civilians on kne side. They get hit by IDF and hamas, of course they're worse off."
"What a straw man argument. Obviously they aren't the same, I was referring to the right to have a country that shares your religion. Which was what I replied to when you said what other religion has their own country. 


Also, you're awfully comfy from your armchair at home. Canada's land was stolen from the natives. We placate and posture with our land acknowledgements. But if a faction of native american decided to bear arms, indiscriminately murder civilians, and declare war, you bet your ass you'd want them pummeled back.

I dont agree with many things israel has done as a country. I don't agree with many things Canada or America have done either. But somehow, when one criticized north American countries, they manage to do it without calling for the complete dismantling/destruction of them. But Israel is fighting constantly for a right to existence.  

The conflict is incredibly complex. There is so much animosity and hatred that there is no trust between nations. Israel withdrew from Gaza and immediately hamas took control and sent daily barages of rockets. Meanwhile, that animosity is unfairly sent to the West Bank where the settlements are unfair and illegal. But we can't ignore 75y of history and pretend that the neighboring areas have ever been friendly to Israel. They have instigated every single war."
Very misleading.  Should say former resident of Toronto who moved to Gaza many years ago is desperate to come back to Canada.
">“Tell me what to do, tell us Canadians what to do here on the ground, please tell me.”  
  


How long has Canada had a travel advisory on Gaza that says **AVOID ALL TRAVEL**"
"Why does it say Toronto? She is not in Toronto. She left Toronto to go live in Gaza. It should say ""Canadian of convenience wishes to be airlifted back to country she left behind long ago"""
I understand people visiting family and friends and being caught off guard by a developing new situation  however is this not different? When was living in Gaza not ultra risky?
Why did she choose to live with two small children in a war zone…
She left Toronto in 2014
"Living in Gaza since 2014 and hasnt been back to canada since. 

Life is about choices. She made a shitty one to stay there. Are we supposed to send in JTF2 to get her out?"
This is what you call a Convenient Canadian... convenient when you need to GTFO of somewhere you chose to be after already being warned not to be there.
Why is this a story? She's been evacuated FIVE times already. That's baffling. Why did you go back?! I swear some of these people actually have a death wish and it's so tragic when they have kids too. Like why are you forcing them to live in a war zone? You had a choice! Going to Gaza from Canada with 2 kids is soooo irresponsible imo.  I heard some dude talking about how his children had died and were martyrs now. That just rubs me the wrong way for some reason.
It's hard to get on her side after choosing to move to Gaza from Toronto. What were you thinking?
A Canadian when it’s convenient.  Stay there.
She will have to wait no way to get anyone out of Gaza
"How is she a “Toronto” mother of two living in Gaza? She’s a Gaza mother of two who used to live in Toronto. She’s lived in Gaza since 2014!! She’s a Gazan not a Torontonian. 

This is the stupid prizes portion that follows the playing of stupid games."
I like how many times she emphasized that she’s Canadian.   Like she’s trying to convince herself.
Canadian of convenience.
"Someone clearly not ethnically Canadian who **chose** to move back in \~2014 and **who has been evacuated five times already** is upset there aren't immediate plans to evacuate her again?

Man I hate this fucking country.

Why did you even move back? If Gaza is somehow more appealing than Toronto, she's probably also extremely well-connected there. Find your own way out Jesus Christ. The perfect example of someone who abuses Canadian citizenship while not contributing whatsoever to the country."
There's a Toronto in Palestine?
Did leopards just eat her face?
"You made your bed, now sleep in it."
I thought Gaza was a open air prison. Why would a Canadian go there?
Um why is she living there and then waiting  the government to intercede?  This isn't a tourist.  What a waste of resources if they evacuate her.
"She is a Canadian, let's not forget that.

But dwelling for 9 years in Hamas-led territory under the protection of a terrorist organization, according to Canada, makes her a fool and possibly a danger. 

If she gets out with Canada's help, they should question her why she voluntarily chose to live under the protection of a terrorist organization."
[deleted]
This woman is incredibly stupid for moving to Gaza and living there since 2014. Don’t hope she dies but the Canadian government is not responsible for her choices.
"It just feels so good to see people finally calling out bullshit like this. 5 years ago, this sub would have had the exact opposite response. 

People are finally angry."
"I can't imagine, must be terrible being in Gaza and being surrounded by terror.

And then a war breaks out as well..."
Real cool how everyone in this thread is basically saying she deserves to die in the bombings because she dared to move to Gaza.
"If she were in Israel, the comments would be much different. Too bad we are all brainwashed by the mainstream media."
Canadian citizens are Canadian citizens. The disgusting nature of the comments in this thread is a really clear indication of how racism is alive and well in this country.
"Regardless of how you feel about her being there to begin with, it speaks volumes to our weakness as a country that we can't get our citizens out of Gaza"
"I can't speak about her case in particular but I hope to fucking god we tighten up immigration and the ""refugee"" and ""asylum"" system.

We have put ourselves in the middle of the Sikh Independence and India Hindu Nationalist Movement by having a majority of our immigration from one nation (Fucking insanely stupid).

And we know scamming and exploitation of the refugee/border/asylum system is going on across the world.

It would be nice to not deal with another crisis especially Islamic Extremism here at home which a lot of other countries are dealing with.

Be nice to see what is happening in the world and get ahead of shit for once."
"True, but it also shows how powerless our country has become that we can't get them out"
"how come we are showing so much hate to this person and not the policies that allow things like this? she sounds like she was either born here or raised from very young. 

if the canadian gov allows citizens to move to another country and retain all priviledges of canada... people will take advantage of it. the gov needs to be held accoutable, amend citizenship rules and regulations. 

that being said, since theyve done nothing against canada themselves as individual private citizens, why shouldnt they reap the benefits that they are entitled to? especially in such a dark time?"
"This.

I have sympathy for the children, not for her."

"Wasn't exactly the same when she emigrated.  And like most people, she became trapped in an apartheid."

Probably immigrated to Toronto in 2012
It's time to end dual citizenship
Really though. Toronto is no shining city on a hill but shit man Gaza idk about that
They are surrounded on all three sides by a hostile power!
Now now cant be racist with logic
"So if moved to Australia in 2014 but was born and raised in Canada until adulthood, I’m no longer Canadian?"
Then so are Canadians in Israel
"What does ""ethnically Canadian"" mean?"
"Reflect on what you just said later today, when you've had a chance to think."
"Oh, most of the ones trying to get out are from Hamas, you can bet on it!"
"Yes, but as another comment here states: Her daddy is a multimillionaire developer, of the Al Zafer Company, who owns a big chunk of Gaza too.

I'm sure she could buy her way out, since there's no way her daddy would have gotten rich without having best friends in Hamas, but the cheapskate wants Canada to rescue her."
"No they aren't saying that. No one has said she should die. The objection is about her pleading for rescue from Canada when she left Canada a long time ago to live a privileged life as a Palestinian. Regardless, Canada can't do anything at this point."
"Maybe as Canadians we are growing tired of people relocating to countries our government has for years issued warnings about, only for them to realize their mistake and demand rescue when the situation inevitably gets out of hand.  What does she expect, Canada to spend millions and put the lives of our diplomatic and military personnel on the line because she chose to live there? I'm all for our society helping its members, but she left Canada years ago and chose who new home, how about she appeal to her current government for aid?"
"I would love it if we could get every innocent civilian out of Gaza. I sincerely hope we can figure out a way to save her and her kids.

I think what people find objectionable is the notion that not being able to get them out is a failing of the Canadian government. She chose to move her family to an incredibly unstable region. Most people in Gaza have never had the privilege to travel in and out of that region. 

That doesn't mean she deserves to be the victim of collateral damage, it's just not the Canadian governments fault that she is caught in this crossfire. Everyone knows these two countries go to war constantly."
">Canadian citizens are Canadian citizens

That's obviously bullshit. Living in Canada for 3 years is all that's required to apply for citizenship. Based on her age I guess that's less than 10% of her life. How Canadian can that make you? Especially if you came to Canada, got your passport, and then immediately moved back to your home country. She doesn't see herself as Canadian, why should we?

Her kids aren't old enough to ever have spent time in Canada either.

We also don't owe anything to ""citizens"" born to birth tourists who never lived in Canada."
">how racism is alive and well in this country

Her daddy is connected to Hamas, who want to exterminate the Jewish race.

Yeah but we're the racists."
Obvious troll
"First of all, have you heard her speak? She sounds like you or I - meaning, born here. To assume
That someone who moved away is an immigrant is plain old ignorant."
"At the very very least, because Canada taxes based on residency. She's getting all the benefits of being Canadian without paying into Canada."
You’re speculating about their relations to hamas to try and justify the situation from a biased lens.
">Wasn't exactly the same when she emigrated

Emigrated to where? She grew up in Palestine as the daughter of a multimillionaire property developer."
I was wondering that because when they were showing pictures of them in their house it was obviously a very large luxurious house which seemed out of place for a regular citizen in Gaza.
That makes a lot more sense for why she's in Gaza.
Great catch!
"> I'm sure she could buy her way out, 

I doubt that right now. Even if she could potentially be smuggled out, the risk of being killed in the process is pretty high.."
She has a Canadian accent. She didn’t immigrate in 2012
"Sure, I assume you also include EU, US and Israeli citizenship in that."
Lol
It’s time to euthanize stupid people.
"Compared to Gaza, for safety and security it's a 9 vs 1 out of 10."
Yup and that lady has no desire to be Canadian she just wants whatever protection the passport affords her which right now is nothing unless she can get to a border
"4 sides actually, warships are there now"
If they live there for years and only come back or beg for help when they want something then yes they are.
Someone whose ancestors settled this country and built it into what it is and has a lineage tracing back several generations as opposed to one who willingly moves back to Gaza and at best has one generation ahead of her that's Canadian.
"If you make poor life choices you have to live with the consequences

like moving your family to fucking Gaza lmao"
Oh.  Interesting.
By the time Isreal is done there won't be much real estate left in Gaza.
">Maybe as Canadians we are growing tired of people relocating to countries our government has for years issued warnings about, only for them to realize their mistake and demand rescue when the situation inevitably gets out of hand

Or maybe we are growing tired of handing out citizenship to immigrants/refugees from dangerous third world countries, so they can immediately move back there, just to come running for help when faced with the logical consequences of their choices."
"If you don’t like how Canada awards citizenship, then advocate to change that. A Canadian is a Canadian. You want a two tier citizenship program? Fuck off."
"In the interviews she sounded pretty Canadian to me, not like someone who had only lived here a few years."
Lmfao being Jewish isn’t a race
The West Bank has never been a peaceful place to live. I don’t have a lot of sympathy for people choosing to live in a region known for political instability.
"They are a land developer in Gaza.

You do not develop any land in Gaza without connections to Hamas."
But Gaza is an open-air prison...
She's literally a member of the ruling class there.
"Why exclude our allies? USA is our dearest ally. Is Gaza in any way an ally? Why expect the same treatment. 

It would make total sense to limit dual citizenship with non-allied countries. Let’s form our immigration policy around importing culturally compatible people, one mediocre proxy for this could be those countries allied to Canada via a trade or defence agreement. 

Not perfect, but better than bringing in people who are enemies of Canada to come stir up conflicts on Canadian soil."
"No, just those other countries with the baddies."
"If your daddy is a millionaire friend of Hamas, Gaza is probably more like an 8/10 on most days."
"I mean Toronto is bad, but it's not 1/10 bad."
Is Egypt a hostile power?
"I appreciate that you hold others to the same standard then. Unfortunately by the downvotes, it doesn’t like most of the sub does."
That leaves a lot of us out.
"I think the downvoting of my comment reflects how unable or unwilling people are to actually think about the value of life at moments like this.

Reflect on the fact that her children are in Gaza, and that they had no choice in moving there. They didn't make any choices."
"No I want a one tier, but when people choose to live elsewhere, they made their choice. Taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook to rescue them."

"Yet people in this thread also want to clamp down on immigration. So you don’t feel sympathy for those living somewhere that’s unstable, but you also don’t want anyone immigrating here. So where are people who live in unstable places supposed to go? People have family, cultural ties, etc. to some Of these places.  Very easy to say “don’t go there” when we haven’t experienced having family somewhere. Just my two cents n"
One could be a king of slum!
">It would make total sense to limit dual citizenship with non-allied countries. 

Kinda what Germany is doing. There are some exceptions, but they mostly only allow dual citizenship for holders of other EU citizenships.

We should restrict ours to NATO countries"

Lol
"Egypt hates the Palestinians, because whenever they let them in they get a massive terrorist uprising.

Look at the disaster that is south Lebanon if you want to see what Palestinians do when you let them in."
"It’s not allowing people from gaza to enter, the us is trying to convince them to open a humanitarian corridor so people can leave, but that’s not happening at this time afaik"
"If you trace back a while in Canadian history and you consider Canada home over any other nation (and thus wouldn’t do something as stupid as this woman like moving to fucking Gaza) then I consider you Canadian, regardless of your creed or colour.

Clearly, this woman has no ties to Canada other than legal ones and she got those explicitly for situations like this - so she could be rescued."
"You can still be Canadian without being ethnically Canadian. 

If I, as someone who is ethnically Canadian, moved to Italy and had children there with my Chinese wife, none of us would be considered ethnically Italian."
I feel little sympathy. You won't convince me that someone who chose to move to Gaza values their own life.
"I complain about Canada? I’m actually defending how Canada awards citizenship but sure, put words in my mouth."
She went there voluntarily. She’s not a victim.
"What about countries that we are allied to, but aren't part of NATO?"
No no the “baddies”
Glad someone laughed :)

"That's a bit difficult to define and changes constantly, doesn't it?

Is India an ally? How about Taiwan?"
Yes.
That’s okay.
Turkey is in NATO. Would they be an ally by your definition?
There's always a ceasefire...until Hamas attacks again...
Hamas will hold off until they can sneak enough weapons through with the MSF and Red Crescent supplies and then they will sent more rockets into Israel breaking the truce. Rinse and repeat.
Asking Israel (and the world) to go back to October 6 and just hoping that the next day isn’t October 7 is about the most naive thing Trudeau has come up with yet.
"How long this ceasefire lasts is up to Hamas.

> The Israeli government said it would extend the truce by an additional day for every 10 hostages released"
Is he really this stupid?
Trudeau is irrelevant to this and any other international issue in 2023.
"The only 'peace' that is possible at this point is a Korean style frozen conflict where both sides are separated by landmine-filled DMZs and have enough artillery/nukes pointed at each other that neither side is going to try anything, and even that assumes the Palestinian side can come up with leadership that cares enough about their civilian population for Mutually Assured Destruction theory to work."
Dude has his head up his ass.
"At this point I don't really care what ""Trudeau says"" he's a farce. International laughing stock."
Longer term peace deal with Hamas?  He must be joking.
"He's so out to lunch. 

No, Justin, Israel has no interest in longer term peace as long as Hamas exists and governs Gaza."
"Hope? If this were any other country after this much carnage there’d be stronger damn words than “hope.” There’s a responsibility to form a long-term deal. Support should hinge upon it. Diasporas understand this cannot happen again if prioritizing safety and the abolishment of Antisemitism around the globe. Plus, like Hamas, Bibi’s regime has got to go."
Yes.
">'We saw some preliminary evidence but we'll keep working with our allies,' Trudeau says

This is the way to go about it."
Little reminder that this conflict isn't a ball game. No need to pick a side.
">""We saw some preliminary evidence but we'll keep working with our allies as quickly as possible before reaching any firm and final conclusion,""

Pretty much my stance as well.

We're talking about war crimes. This is not something to take lightly. Standards of evidence should be very high, and a thorough process, with independently obtained evidence, should be the basis for assigning responsibility (and, if possible, prosecute the responsible ones).

I'll refer to the downing of the [Malaysia Airlines Flight 17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_17) in 2014 over Ukraine. Early on, there were allegations that Russia was involved, but there was a lengthy process until a report came out by an independent investigation body, in 2015. Political responsibility was assigned in 2018 by the affected governments. Based on that, later, convictions were made of persons involved (two Russians and a Ukrainian separatist), and broader responsibility to Russia was assigned as well by the court.

That is the process to follow, and that takes time.

Politicians should stay away from making conclusions as to who is responsible for what war crimes, until independent reports are available, and in fact until after convictions are made. That is the normal process we follow for any criminal prosecution, and in cases involving war crimes, we should adhere to the same standards.

Edited: verb choice, thanks to u/TheNakedGun"
"It’s important to remember when evaluating these competing claims that the information we get is deliberately constrained. Israel is not allowing international journalists into Gaza, so no one can supply a reliable 3rd party source of information.

Canada should be lobbying Israel to allow independent observers into Gaza. I don’t see any reason why this would be controversial."
"Global News has a thread on this 

""The PM repeatedly used the word “attack” in his answer. Senior officials tell me that wasn’t intended to imply it was the Israelis. One senior political source and a national security source say Canadian int points to same conclusion as US and Israel - it came from w/in Gaza""

"The Headline:

>Trudeau not ready to accept U.S. finding that Palestinian outfit was behind Gaza hospital blast

The Article:

>""We are working closely with allies to determine exactly what happened,""

>""We saw some preliminary evidence but we'll keep working with our allies as quickly as possible before reaching any firm and final conclusion,""

Headline is a little sensationalized, no?"
"If only his ministers had shown the same caution before insinuating that Israel had done it.

Lots of folk were tripping over themselves to be the first to blame Israel."
"People are faulting the Media and Trudeau.  The first few hours, we all saw images of the blast, and immediately thought ""bomb"".

That was enough for sports fans to decide who did what.  I'm already seeing people shifting this to ""Hamas did this deliberately"", and ""if an errant missile could miraculously shift trajectory and speed and hit a hospital, then the missile failure can also coincide with an Israeli attack"" kind of piss fight.

So it's wise not to beat that dead hoarse."
"Previous comments are too exhausting to read. Issue for me is that some of these comments address the Israelis in Hamas as each representing government that was duly elected. Hamas is a terrorist organization that overthrew the duly elected government and continues to control the Palestinian people of Gaza with a combination of disinformation, manipulation, and violence. People need to stop speaking of these two entities as equals."
Plenty condemned Israel with nothing but Hamas's word but now we have to wait for the evidence before having an opinion.
">Palestinian outfit

Say Hamas.  You sound anti semitic when you blame Palestinians instead of Hamas"
"Everyone in the house of commons was quick to call out Israel when reports first started. But now that evidence is starting to show that it wasn't Israel, NOW is the time to proceed with caution when making statements about the incident?"
Wasn't it a parking lot? Was a hospital involved at all?
Trudeau is a doushbag
"why dont we just send trudeau over to Israel and Gaza and he just can apologize to everyone about everything, cause thas the only thing he knows how to do, oh and he can raise and impose new taxes on both countries."
"So this guy was ready to accept US intelligence in the murder of Nijjar, not in this. Interesting."
"The idea that an errant rocket just happened to bullseye a hospital - Oopsie! - is ludicrous. 

Who launched it is up for debate, but it was no “accident”."
"Odd, not ready to accept US findings, but jumped all over Hamas' findings..."
"Just look on Reddit at what the Israel strikes look like. When they want a building flattened, it's flattened."
"When it comes to the US/Israeli relationship, it's not always clear who's in charge.  I remain very skeptical of any claims that come from the Israelis."

"It's super weird to see ""Canadians"" in r/Canada celebrating some weird idea that Trudeau is some pariah on the world stage. Like it doesn't even come from reality, or atleast no reality outside of right wing opinion pieces. Like all these guys saying ""none of our allies share intelligence info with Canada because specifically Trudeau is bad and evil"" and forgetting that it would be our security apparatus sharing information with their security apparatus. Like do most of the people here not understand how our government works and also cheer for some imaginary situation where we aren't friends with our friends? 

Right wing brain rot is fucking nuts."
Wonder how many in this thread work for IDF
"Let it be known that the most anti-israel news network, Al Jazeera, admitted (by inference) that it was a Palestinian rocket and not an Israeli missile before our incompetent government did.

[They could not deny the overwhelming evidence and so ended up concluding that the damage was caused by fragments of a Palestinian rocket that was intercepted by Iron Dome.](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/19/what-hit-ahli-hospital-in-gaza)"
Extremely rare Trudy W
"Absolutely, that should have been the stance of all third parties instead of rushing to one side."
"When he thought it was Israel that bombed the hospital, he was immediately at the podium saying it was unacceptable.  

Now, with evidence pointing to another group (terrorists), he's dilly-dallying.   

Why?"
"He can’t. He looked really bad jumping to a conclusion very quickly without looking at all the evidence. I think he’s hoping for some clear evidence he was originally right. 

Man… a standing O for a legit Nazi, now this. Needs to do some research before reacting, or fire the people who are supposed to do that for him.

Besides the point - this is not the place to pick sides really. The main point should be that too many innocents are being killed over there due to “revenge” on both sides it’s disgusting."
PMJT is leading from the front on this one- best not to rush into baseless opinions on small issues in the region.
"Why does Trudeau’s opinion matter? They’ve basically no say in what happens whatsoever. It’s like if the president of Mexico says something about that conflict, it’s just pointless and irrelevant"
"""U.S. finding that Palestinian outfit was behind Gaza hospital blast"" Is this the same US intelligence that said Iraq had WMDs?"
"Not just US intel saying this. BBC also had several experts look at
the data & stated the blast wasn’t consistent with an Israeli missile. More likely a Palestinian misfire."
"yo man, they got camera footage from al jazera showing it coming from gaza, and a audio recording israel took with them admitting it wasn't from israel. if it was a missile it would have left a crater in the ground. Don't be scared i got your back man. If anyone threatens violence me and you can walk out in sexy clothing and use our words to beat their violence back. If the truth doesn't stop the violence response you will get from the protesters, our fashion will scare them away."
Can we rename this sub to r/notreallyrepresentativeofcanada?
Good not to jump to conclusions.
Very weird headline phrasing.
"I just want to know, for the sake knowledge, what would be the effect of a roof knocker missing a roof and hitting a parking lot with a lot of cars and motorbikes, that are all filled with oil and gas. What kind of explosion would that cause?"
"If the first casualty in war is truth as goes the famous saying, then he's absolutely going about this the right way. I'm also waiting for further evidence."
"b..but source from usa is deemed as ""credible source"" right? why not in this case?"
We can't afford more war. Simple.
[deleted]
"It’s not unlikely that one of the thousands of rockets flying over head had a mechanical failure and no one intended for it to hit the hospital. Munitions fail all the time.

Israel doesn’t gain anything from the horrible publicity. Hamas gains international sympathy… but I doubt if the truth will ever be known."
MFer... I agree with him on this one!
 😤 They Team America’d their own hospital.
Did he not see the videos ? It’s seems pretty conclusive that rocket came from the barrage being sent off from within Gaza.
"Absolutely insane to see people spouting their completely unqualified 'analysis' here, and people commending them for it. Truly amazing time we live in, where someone can be a munitions expert, a climate scientist, a virologist and a doctor, all without any training or relevant education."
The best part is the deniers will have to admit Al Jazeera is fake news
"It’s really irrelevant, pretty clear neither side intended to hit the hospital so it’s a friendly fire incident either way. Just one of the horrific things that happens during war.

All of this is just posturing so that people can say “oh my side is innocent” when both sides are responsible for needless death and destruction."
It has to be said that there are war crimes everywhere in Gaza. The hospital is the only one the west noticed due to the response in the Muslim world.
"The Americans know when anything is on fire or launched in the world and the algorithms to determine where things were launched from and where they might impact.   


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-Based\_Infrared\_System"
"ok ok

respect where respect is due. this is a nuanced, careful take on a very delicate situation with a lot of fog of war."
"Yeah I wouldn't trust shit the US or Israel says about this, just like with Hamas and all of their bs propaganda. 

Why would I take anything said as true from two terrorist ethnostates and the warmonger that backs them?"
"so let me get this straight, 5 eyes allies(lets be honest it basically US who does all the intelligence ) allegedly provides ""credible evidence"" which states indian govt was involved in killing nijjar, and this guy is up in arms, but he's not ready to accept U.S. finding that Palestinian outfit was behind Gaza hospital blast!!?? I am sorry but that’s really dumb. That selective nitpicking of intelligence. I don’t think this current Canadian govt can be trusted at any level, i am lost of words, this guy it sounds like is either a puppet or that dumb."
But he was super ready to condemn Israel when everyone claimed they had bombed the hospital.
"Letting antisemitic rhetoric stew longer based on the reports from known terrorists is irresponsible.

Everyone was quick to attack Israel and Jews based on lies. These people should not be in Canada."
"He is smart to not accept it given that the Israelis have blatantly lied about so many war crimes in the recent past that they turned out to have committed—the killing of the Canadian military commander in Lebanon, the American journalist last year, the four gazan boys on the beach, the disabled palestinian man, and 12+ other hospital attacks. In each case they produced “evidence” which turned out to have been doctored, refused third party investigation, and then eventually admitted complicity but it was always “a tragic accident”. 

We need a third party investigation, particularly as the church that runs the hospital have confirmed they received a warning call for the bombing from israel shortly before the attack"
"Trudeau didn't make a mistake.

He just experienced the hospital bombing differently than reality."
"I'm inclined to believe the Israeli stance much more than Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah or even the PLO, who have naturally seized on the opportunity. Not that the IDF is known for its transparency or objectivity, but at least it belongs to an elected democracy.

Israelis strikes follow a pattern, and there would be no reason to strike a parking lot of a hospital (unless you believe of course they are literal ghouls). I read that the crater it left was tiny, and that based on witness accounts it did seem to be mainly an incendiary spray (i.e. fire, from unspent rocket fuel).

Still, making more of the evidence public would be nice. Trudeau having a cool head is a good thing here.

I find it hard to take sides here, but still, fuck Hamas. They fucked around, and now they're finding out."
"The propaganda channels are in full effect, from both sides. Both sides have garbage people in charge. This should not be a controversial take. 40 beheaded babies, hospital blasts. Let’s just say fuck Hamas and any of their supporters and fuck the IDF for the levelling of Gaza. This is the way."
He’ll invite some veterans of the Charlemagne division to consult with on whether they can trust Israel
Right approach. No point in having your own independent investigative team if you're just going to accept what the US says.
"Honestly, after it turned out that the hospital wasn't leveled and everyone is up in arms over a parking lot being hit, who really gives a shit which side it was?"
"If Israel was responsible, the hole would have been a lot bigger. It looks like it was incendiary damage, not explosive damage. If it was an Israeli missile which malfunctioned, fell and spilled fuel, there would still be parts of the missile body for Hamas to show to the world."
"The fact that it's conceivable that Israel would hit a hospital killing hundreds says a lot. Whether this specific attack was Isreal doesn't much change that its with the norm for their behaviour.

Ffs they're literally stopping a million Palestinian children from getting water. Is bombing a hospital worse than that?"
"Haven't the Israeli terrorists been, literally, calling for evacuation from that hospital in their ""warnings""?

They thought people would support them and they celebrated it on twitter.

Videos of people pulling out pieces from under the rubble started going viral and all the IDF terrorist sympathisers started deleting their tweets.

Then, they started posting unclear videos or videos of literal timestamps of 40 minutes POST time of impact as proof that it was Hamas.

Today morning, they are denying any hospital even was hit.

The media has truly convinced us to support rampant, unchecked terrorism, as long as it's done by the IDF."
Sensible
"The amount of people who not only celebrated a terrorist attack the day after it happened, and now are  just eating up ANYTHING a terrorist organization says at face value when it comes to deaths is INCREDIBLY telling.


Im not even going to entertain 'we were supporting palestine, not hamas' or any garbage like that, the DAY after a terrorist attack, people were literally in the streets cheering. And now are just immediately promoting hamas lies when thet figured it was a 'win' against israel. We all know what you were doing. And its vile."
"Because it's fishy at best, and if true, pure chance. Israel had announced they were going to bomb that hospital, and even if miraculously, they hadn't, is bombing everything around a hospital for five square miles really that much more humanitarian? The media is being spun to shit on this."
"What the fuck is wrong with this dude, honestly."
Hamas has killed more Muslims than all others combined in their years of terror.
"So let me get this right. Israeli intelligence had no clue that a 9/11 size terrorist attack was about to be committed, but in the middle of indiscriminate bombing of residential area, a hospital get hit, and now israelis have intercepts of hamas admitting they did it? Hmmm. And no i dont condone murder."
Considering Trudeau is very pro-Israel this is interesting. If the evidence was so clear he would just side with the US and Israel on this.
Well tell him to jump the Canada spy satellites and produce evidence to the contrary. …. Oh wait a sec!
Imagine how conflicted he'll be when satellite photos show the flame pattern forms a giant swastika.
"What's not to accept? If it killed anyone, it was a handful of people at best and mostly just burned a parking lot full of cars. The hospital's fine, no patients or doctors were killed, we literally have pictures of and videos of the whole thing."
I thought everyone agreed that it was a parking lot that got bombed not a hospital...
I agree with Trudeau
Pretty sure not one person in the world gives a shit what he thinks at this point.
Israel bombed houses of worship hospitals and essentials infrastructure long before the current escalation. They’re not above it. They had 3 different conflicting stories on what happened before settling on Hamas. I’ll take their own investigation with a grain of salt.
No one cares what he thinks.
Why is Canada even weighing in on something that’s not Hockey or maple syrup?
So y’all **do** just want Trudeau to blindly follow the US?
Canada is a useless country in the global military world anyway so who cares
What a joke. When this came out and everyone instantly accepted and blamed Israel without any evidence. Now that the shoe is on the other foot all of the sudden the threshold for evidence dramatically changes.
"Hamas literally admitted to it.  
Wtf."
The findings where Israel investigated itself and found itself clear of any wrong doing? Somehow we know this line of reasoning doesn't work with cops but for states known for humanitarian issues? Sure!
Here’s an idea 💡 let’s stay the fuck out of other countries business ?
"good.  Israel is a country that lies all the time.  They denied and deflected about their murder of the Al-Jazeera journalist, Shireen Abu Akleh, until the evidence was so overwhelming they couldn't anymore.  And then they blamed Palestinians on it anyway.  And then they send in the jackbooted thugs to beat the shit out of people attending her funeral. 

 They are a deeply depraved, immoral and sick government."
"Good. Not taking wholesale acceptance of claims, preliminary evidence, and shaky eyewitness accounts inside a gong show of a war zone for something that would be an egregious war crime is the right approach."
What is the debate?  There is video of it!  From multiple different angles.  You can clearly see an entire volley of rockets being fired - and where they were fired from.
I hear Hamas has WMDs as well.
Trudeau: I just do what others tell me
"Hahahaha so - we have Trudeau's secret TeH InDiAnS ArE kIlLiNg CaNaDiaNs with no evidence and yet he;s willing to hang on for evidence in this case.

What a buffoon."
Remember when the Americans said that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and then hundreds of thousands of Iraqis were killed but there were no weapons on mass destruction? Best to take the American intelligence with some skepticism.
"Trudeau stands strong with Hamas propaganda, or ""misinformation"" as he loves to say."
Trudeau not ready to accept that anybody on the global stage gives literally no fucks about him
You spelled parking lot wrong
"America: Credible when it comes to finding that India Assassinated some one on Canadian soil. 

America: Not credible when it comes to the effects of their own weapons in the hands of a close ally. 

Ok."
Trudeu’s waiting for input on what to say from the head of the Islamophobia office…doesn’t want to set off riots
Just like when IdF sniped that American journalist and blamed it on Palestine snipers.
Worst PM ever.  Completely clueless.
What a fucking doofus
"Wow, unexpected from Trudeau but good on him!"
"Finally some backbone! Nobody can be 100% convinced at this point, especially since Israel has a history of lying when they kill innocent Palestinians and Hamas is Hamas."
He’s an idiot
No one in the world cares about him. Canada and him are a joke now. He should just shut up until we can vote for a more competant pm
"Y’all are nuts. 

One side has a mountain of evidence supporting its claim. 

The other is the word of a terrorist group with 0 evidence. 

People are acting like we should believe hamas until Israel can prove it was them with 100% certainty. Nah I’ll believe Israel and the evidence until hamas can put up even a scrap of evidence"
"It doesn’t matter if the beheaded babies story true or not. The Hamas did unspeakable things regardlessly. Similarly, it doesn’t matter if Israel bombed the hospital or not, they’re still carpet bombing civilians, starving them, and using white phosphorus."
"Man, he""ll immediately label Canadian citizens as fringe minority or hateful... but when actually violence and war ia taking place he wants to take his time to review the facts... horn honking, arrest them! Missle strike on hospital killing innocnents, well you know, need time to think..."
"Isn't the US finding evidence, a five eyes partner, credible?"
"These Reddit detectives seem to have an all seeing eye into this conflict somehow lol it’s wise to be skeptical of what you are being told about this incident. Likely we will never knew who did this, you’re just going to be told what ever story fits the chosen narrative best."
"Obligatory: Not a fan of Trudeau.


However he does have some areas of competence and this is one. In time all facts will come to light, in the meantime we don't need to speculate as to who did what. There's no prize to be won playing that game.


IMHO it's too early to jump the gun and loose language like 'the other team' by Uncle Joe, makes no sense."
"American here. Never paid much attention to the criticism of Trudeau, but now changing my mind."
Remember when the US lied for months that they had nothing to do with the Afgani wedding party slaughter...well it'll be a cold day in hell when I believe anything coming from the US intelligence community (OF WMD fame) much less the lying IDF who has killed more Americans than most terrorist groups.
"I’ve looked at the evidence myself and although it’s not 100% conclusive, it does seem like it was a rocket originating from Gaza that was intercepted or failed, although again it’s not 100% sure, it does seem the Israelis didn’t bomb the hospital. .. this time. 

I don’t mind our government waiting to see more evidence though, let’s not forget about the American lies of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq… US intelligence isn’t perfect nor is it unbiased either."
"Lets remember how IDF denounced not killing Shireen. ABU Akleh. Blamed the Palestinians initially but later on admitted to it. 


Only things that's going to resolve it is an independent investigation."
Who cares what the Canadians think
"Seems kinda odd that a rocket could kill 471 people due to a misfire but thousands upon thousands that make it into Israel never do near this amount of damage.

Then theres that tweet that got deleted.....

Fog of war is thick..."
"Said the same PM that had evidence (yet forth coming) of foreign interference in Canada by India. News flash - the U.S. dod has evidence already. 

“How to Alienate allies and become a global pariah” in stores and on shelves in 2024."
This coming from a country that celebrates and uplift Nazis at their highest level of Government. Are you surprised?
"""israel's number 1 ally and protector says that israel didn't do it"" uh OKAY"
Even a broken watch is right twice a day.
"Maybe he learned from bogus US claim that served as catalyst to go into Iraq. A little delay, while there is a strong push to agree, is not a bad thing. To say the delay means he is for Hamas is not valid."
A question. Does Islamic Jihad have rockets that can be that destructive?
"So the blast happened in the parking lot. A munite after a failed launch of a terrorist rocket. There was no crater, nor a significant enough amount of damage to attribute it to an Israeli bomb or missile. So that leaves?"
he's just mad because he was one if the first to condemn Israel and now he doesn't want to look stupid.
"We weren't a part of the conversation. That's why we have no comment imo.

Not being a part of the conversation should be the real concern."
"Yeah, us Americans aren’t ready to accept that bullshit either."
"If it’s the same source who claimed that Iraq had WMDs, why on earth would you believe them? Good on you, Trudeau."
Canada will use their secret spy network in Gaza to get to the bottom of this......you know they have way more intel and military power than the US or Israel. Oh wait? We dont have a military anymore.....he gutted it and gave all the arms to Ukraine.
"The problem this situation is illuminating is the complete spread of disinformation.  People are sharing ""facts"" that others are completely refuting with their own ""facts"". Videos, he said she said, photos, journalist reports.  At this stage, pick a side and you can find convincing evidence to refute it.

The battle goes deeper than just the explosion."
Biden and the rest of the world leaders not ready to accept that Trudeau is competent.
Good.  Nobody wants him to make us continue being America's gimp
Am I crazy or have satellite and ground photos not shown the hospital is perfectly intact save for a blast to the parking lot? Or Are those photos not legitimate? Because hamas was quoted as saying 500 ppl died but they were still pulling people out of the rubble when in fact the rubble was nonexistent and that blast couldn’t have kill 500 ppl even if you tired. Feel free to correct me here though
"I believe USA lied when they said Irak had mass destruction weapons, so I cant truste USA here. Is other part with interests. USA side strongly with Israel interests."
"“American intelligence agencies estimate that a deadly blast at a Gaza hospital on Tuesday killed between 100 and 300 people…” (1)

“U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Israel was not responsible for the explosion at Gaza’s Al Ahli Hospital, based on videos collected by civilians, satellite imagery, missile activity tracked by infrared sensors and other intelligence.” (2)

“The United States has infrared sensors, which are both satellite and aircraft based, that can determine the launch sites of a variety of rockets and missiles. That technology has proved critical to the American assessment that Israel was not responsible for the blast at the hospital.”(3)

“…U.S. spy agencies say Israeli officials have intercepted communications that indicate some militants in Gaza believed the explosion was caused by an errant rocket or missile launched by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad…” (4)

“U.S. intelligence agencies have reported to the White House and Congress that there was only light structural damage to the hospital following the blast, and no impact craters on the hospital.” (5)

On an independent channel called, “Military and History,” the man who owns the channel (a German military historian) did a thorough analysis of the explosion at the hospital. He used open source intelligence and vetted it while the MSM was repeating a distorted narrative. Here’s the link:

That would have been a lot more meaningful if his people hadn't just condemned the attack as an Israeli war crime without any evidence.
"Trudeau : we have intel but can't show you guys, please just trust us bro"
"Well atleast someone used their brain in his cabinet. Don't trust any U.S. investigation, even if it does turn out to be a misfired hamas projectile. They just want war to continue."
Trudeau is a complete Wanker!
Trudeau doesn't have a clue about anything. He really isn't a credible source.
This is just Trudeau signaling that the wheels need a bit more grease before he'll toe the line.
It's only okay when the US bombs hospitals in the Middle East /s
"Joe ""40 Decapitated Babies"" is surely a trustworthy source of info on this."
"The US and Israel have shown evidence to support that the “hospital” bombing was the result of a miss fired rocket from Gaza to Israel.  
They have produced videos, satellite images, and audio conversations supporting this.  
Hamas claimed within minutes of the explosion that it was Israel and 500 were dead.  
Trudeau without question supported Hamas claim and blamed Israel.  
President Biden repeatedly put the responsibility on a rocket fired from inside Gaza.  
Trudeau is waiting for information from “Canada’s Allies”  
Who are “Canada’s Allies”?"
"Russia immediately went to the UN before evidence, so with that my assumption is it wasn't Israel but an active measure to push propaganda and may have even been sabotage / maskirovka using a front. 

The key point though the attack helps misdirect from Russia bombing hospitals and apartment buildings daily. This whole thing is a distraction that can't be solved and the root cause is the Kremlin fronts. Russia needs big enough chaos to misdirect from Ukraine, they'll push these more and more. Stay on target. 

Guess who Russia blames for the bombing? The US... ffs bro. Clearly sabotage. The problem here is Trudeau is falling for the same thing so many others do, giving the Kremlin the benefit of the doubt.


All so telling... Kremlin can't allow peace here. They need it as a fallback distraction and have used it at every single point to distract when they lose a round.

Just look at who benefits right now from Israel/Palestine....and who might be pushing it. Kremlins and Kreminals...

[Russia will soon be labeled a state support of terrorism which they are and have been since Putin took power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Litvinenko#Support_of_terrorism_worldwide_by_the_KGB_and_FSB). Putin rated 9/11 an 11/9.

> Support of terrorism worldwide by the KGB and FSB

> Litvinenko stated that ""all the bloodiest terrorists of the world"" were connected to FSB-KGB, including Carlos ""The Jackal"" Ramírez, Yasser Arafat, Saddam Hussein, Abdullah Öcalan, Wadie Haddad of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, George Hawi who led the Communist Party of Lebanon, Ezekias Papaioannou from Cyprus, Sean Garland from Ireland... Litvinenko said that ""the center of global terrorism is not in Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan or the Chechen Republic.

[Support of terror in the Middle East against the West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Litvinenko#Alleged_Russia%E2%80%93al-Qaeda_connection), the recent al-Zawahiri, Osama Bin Ladens right hand, is another step in the direction of labelling Russia a state that sponsors terrorism.

> Alleged Russia–al-Qaeda connection

> In a July 2005 interview with the Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita, Litvinenko alleged that Ayman al-Zawahiri, a prominent leader of al-Qaeda, was trained for half a year by the FSB in Dagestan in 1997. Litvinenko said that after this training, al-Zawahiri ""was transferred to Afghanistan, where he had never been before and where, following the recommendation of his Lubyanka chiefs, he at once ... penetrated the milieu of Osama bin Laden and soon became his assistant in Al Qaeda."" Konstantin Preobrazhenskiy, a former KGB officer and writer, supported this claim and said that Litvinenko ""was responsible for securing the secrecy of Al-Zawahiri's arrival in Russia; he was trained by FSB instructors in Dagestan, Northern Caucasus, in 1996–1997.""

One of many reasons he is not respected by his peers on a national stage.  I guess he hasn’t watched any of the videos or seen the satellite after photos.
"He's such an idiot, can't wait for the next election..."
Can't wait for this IDIOT to finally be out of office. I really hope enough Canadians have finally woken up by the next election 🤦‍♂️
Massive balls.
"Israel has bombed hospitals before and is bombing churches, a bakery- all where civilians are known to be. Israel openly admitted to bombing it and then retracted the statement to blame it on Hamas. They were caught in lies many times"
"Channel 4 and Al Jazeera have BOTH done investigations which discredit Israel’s claim.

"Wise decision, Isreali evidence hasn't been the most reliable source of information on the recent events.

Especially with the amount of credible intel denying their evidence."
"WOW, Trudeau making a sound decision? 🤯"
"He's worried about the Muslim vote, not the accuracy of his statements."
"I've seen mountains of evidence that point to it being a rocket fired from gaza and literally no evidence that points to it being an air strike.

At this point it's not even fair to call it a hospital blast, it was a parking lot blast"
"DOUBLE STANDARD CHICKEN…

With India - we saw the preliminary evidence and India most definitely ordered the kill

With Israel - we saw the preliminary evidence and we don’t know, you know…."
Princess Justine Trudeau is a joke.
Who cares anymore what this asshat thinks? He’s no longer relevant (not that he ever really was) and is a condemned man trying to prolong the inevitable walk to the gallows. Farewell Sock Boy.

"This guy is such an absolute tool. It’s no wonder the U.S. has started to simply not care about him or what he says, he has no sway"
"Given the sometimes questionable reliability of the intelligence the US chooses to share with its allies, and it’s history of conveniently making shit up in order to intervene in the affairs of other countries, I think waiting to be 100% certain is not a bad idea.

https://theintercept.com/2023/03/19/george-bush-iraq-lies-trump/"
It’s pretty fucking obvious it was a misfired rocket and delaying/denying the truth is just fanning the flames of anti-Semitism locally and globally.
Pretty surprised by this considering how deep down our throat Israel is.
"Expect anything else from this guy, all this when his country has proven hamas rallies in his cities"
What an idiot…
I don't trust anything that comes from US or Israel. Neither is trustworthy. I don't even recognize Hamas.
Guy is a fucking idiot. You could show him a can of peaches and he’d argue it’s grape jelly.
"This is flat earther level of denialism happening. 

It's time to accept the earth is round and stop the nonsense.

Israel is allowed to not be culpable for one fucking thing."
Just like he isn't ready to accept that he's enabling a massive housing crisis and crippling our healthcare and education systems via mass immigration.   How about focus on home Trudeau. No one asked you anything about the middle east
I never thought it was possible for a leader to be as big an embarrassment to his country than Trump was.  But I give Trudeau credit for trying.
"Did he tell the truth too soon ?
Retract retract"
"I've seen posts that contain screen shots of an Israeli politician? who was claiming the IDF hit the hospital and took out HAMAS fighters. The post had been taken down but was screen-shot before that. The real question is, which is more likely: that HAMAS blew themselves up to cast a bad light on the IDF, or the IDF, who are actively bombing the shit out of Gaza, hit the hospital? Trudeau is right to look for independent confirmation."
"this is the fuckin way it should be.

the only acceptable thing america can say at this point is ""yup, it was an extremist group, definitely not the people we are very publicly supporting"". 

and literally **everyone** else should question it. they should question everything."
Thank you mr. Trudeau. You are the best PM ever.
"I don’t accept US findings on hospital attack but I firmly believe in US findings on Indias involvement in domestic killing , I haven’t seen clueless government in handling in foreign affairs"
"Mr. Trudeau, I would like an explanation for how an Israeli precision-guided bomb left a tiny crater. And it's not a roof-knocking munition which wouldn't leave charring."
That's what happens when you're so quick to blame Isreal. Come on be a man and admit you made a mistake.
"There is nothing to find. Everyone knows it's Israel. Start watching international news people and you will see that Israeli strikes have killed countless children and women over the past 2 weeks ( something you don't see in western media). 

Israel is known to target hospitals, churches, mosques and other civilian populations. This ridiculous coverup for Israel's crimes is a shame just so that they are not held accountable in front of the international courts. Stop the lies and fabrications, people had enough with this genocide against the Palestinian people.

If you believe otherwise, you are either a fool or ignorant. Even the Israelis themselves said that they will target hospitals and that nowhere in Gaza is safe. Not only that but they also initially said that they bombed the hospital. They quickly however had to retract because they didn't want the international community to think of them badly."
"Let’s all just face the fact that ONCE AGAIN, Israel will cave to international pressure and NOT bulldoze Gaza into the water, or make sure that they kill all the leaders."
What is sad is that this hospital bs is taking up so much of the airwaves. Israel didn't do it -- but there are still a LOT of palestinian civilian casualties because of their ACTUAL air strikes.
Because biden lied.
Trudeau is such an embarrassment.
He doesn’t want riots on his streets due to a lax citizenship process.
Not surprising. Canada just gave a standing ovation to a Nazi the other day.
Very rare Trudeau win
"Israel is known to lie about things like this (re: Shireen Abu Akleh) and the US is their biggest ally. I don't like Trudeau but he's playing this properly.

Remember when US claimed Iraq had nukes and launched a war?"
"Common sense.

The USA has insanely strong ties to Israel and a history of shameless lying. I wouldn't believe them either, not without solid evidence."
"US, the biggest israeli ally found that Israel did not bomb a hospital.

Excuse me if this is abit of ""we have investigated ourselves and found that we did nothing wrong"""
Smart guy. Wish the states has a leader like him.
"It’s not like world leaders care what Trudeau has to say , he’s seen to that result himself"
Why would Hamas bomb it's own hospital? Why would Israel take credit for it immediately then withdraw?
🤡
Good! Because it’s all been a pack of lies.
"I know it sucks because people are literally dying, but my silver lining is the morons who rode the ""Islamophobia"" train for 8 years now tongue tying themselves to justifying that the insane islamist core belief that all jews need to die actually is super not cool and isn't allowed in Canada runs straight into the Liberal party's brick wall of ""all muslim garbage ideas are allowed into Canada"" that Harper was warning us about in 2015."
Anyone whos played a few war based video games can point out 100 things wrong with the hospital attack and it being pinned on Israel.
Is... is the cbc turning on Trudeau?
If Israel didn’t do it why did they produce flyers warning everyone their intentions to bomb the hospital?  Why did the IDF immediately claim responsibility lying instead it was a munitions depot?
Get this fucking clown in some makeup already
This is why he and by proxy Canada is not taken seriously on the world stage.
Lol with what intelligence… oh right he has none
"Noone cares what his opinion is, including any of the countries involved or watching not just his own citizens. 

The only one who seems to care is CBC and Trudeau himself"
"Plenty of proof the IDF did it, they're also bombing very close to other hospitals... either they have shite aim, or they're targeting hospitals."
"Yeah when it happened this is fine to say. Now there's enough evidence to conclusively say it was a terrorist rocket misfire. An Israeli Airstrike would have left a far bigger crater and done more damage.

I've been happy with what Trudeau has said for the majority of the conflict but this is the wrong message given the evidence available."
Clueless as usual...
Doesn't want to upset his jihadi buddies is my guess.
"Fucking finally something from the west, thank you, thank you so much supposed calm liberal institutions. We’re finally getting the slightest pushback to bullshit claims made by a nation that is ENGAGING IN AN ETHNIC. CLEANING. CAMPAIGN."
He's a leftist and therefore leans Palestinian.
First time Trudeau has grown a pair during his entire political career.
But he'll jump to conclusions that the Indian government assassinated someone on Canadian soil? Interesting.
Let’s goooo Canada! This is how you deal with Israeli BS and propaganda.
Trudeau is definitely not the brightest.
Trudeau should just admit he spouted off before knowing any facts.
I’m more surprised that anyone actually cares about Canadas opinion.
Biden says it looks like it was the other team.  Nice he refers to crimes against humanity as football.
"[Video of the misfired Hamas rocket, HD and pretty clear of you watch it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/s/f0WkhRirvu)"
"The proof is already out that it was Israel.

A US munitions expert analyzed the attack.

There is a tweet from the Israeli defence minister celebrating it before deleting the tweet.

The hospital and church received a warning to evacuate  from Israel, but couldn't in such a short timespan.

Stop buying into fascist Israeli propaganda. Or don't, whatever."
"Another investigative report was released [https://youtu.be/yyNLvL\_8SeY](https://youtu.be/yyNLvL_8SeY) 

also, the good old [edited statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/17au4ku/the_israeli_deputy_media_advisor_appointed_by/)"
It was all the geo-locating nerds for me. Objective truths are just that regardless of who’s reporting them. Bit of irony with the whole India thing tho
Hey Canada; focus on internal problems. Stop getting distracted by every little thing.
Neither have Macron (France) or Sunak (Britain)
Lol no one is showing Canada or JT anything.
"Sounds like somebody is a dirty, right wing conspiracy theorist."
Here's what I can say with absolute certainty: JT is an absolute moron that couldn't organize a coherent thought.
Israel. Just go in and smoke all those terrorists
"Holy shit this is going too far! This is fucking Canada! Everything Trudeau has tried to label as Canada is a false pseudo woke utopia is bullshit. Stop sucking off groups who are protesting. ""If"" a Palestinian group fired a rocket that malfunctioned and caused collateral damage, then a Palestinian group did that!"
"I mean, US findings are basically Israel's findings and we only need to go back a few years to see a pattern where..yeah Israel's findings are not to be trusted. They always deny it was them, and only admit it when they're blatantly caught later. See their assassination of the reporter Shireen just to get an idea, and there are hundreds more.

So yeah, no one should really trust US findings on this matter. It's US's war as much as it is israels and there's pretty much no reason why anyone should trust that so I guess Trudeau is wise to say what he has. 

Channel 4 did a great analysis, check it out."
IT WASN’T A HOSPITAL BLAST!! No one died and it was a wayward explosion and only hit the parking lot. Stop the lying!!!!
He always has to be the contrarian c\*nt doesn't he?
What does Trudeau even stand for?
What are we going to do anyways
Seems like a common motto here is don't believe your lying eyes.
"What if it was Israel mossad and cia behind the attacks, giving them a reason to destroy Gaza and then rebuild the way they want. That seems more like the truth. I don’t think Canadians are able to realize that."
Its not like Israel has bombed that hospital previously.
"Biden blatantly lied and offered no retraction or apology about seeing the 40 beheaded babies ""with his own eyes"", so I take anything that senile idiot says with a grain of salt. Not a fan of Trudeau lately but I'm glad he's not just going along with what grandpa says"
The last you would want to do is believe your eyes and ears. I saw what Israel showed as evidence. And the audio. It's cut and dry to me. It wasn't Israel..
Trudeau doesn’t know what foot is his left foot.  How would this joke of a PM know where a rocket came from.
"Trudeau is trying to play the significant minorities who voted for him in last election and gave him enough votes to be PM.

The significant portion of minorities (who come from once colonized countries) aren’t pro-Israel and see Israel as colonizer/oppressor…"
[deleted]
What can we expect from the leader of terrorism supporters in Canada?
"I think Canada should take in all of the Hamas in. As per  Trudeau they are honorable people. I never knew that Canada was the penal colony of the world. It specializes in supporting terrorists, murderers and fraudsters from china , India, Pakistan ,Bangladesh , African countries to Sri Lanka and Syria. We salute Canada for its sacrifice for world good."
"Shocker.

In other news... Canadians are not ready to accept the LPC gaslighting that Canadians' financial difficulties can be solved by cancelling Disney+."
someone gift Trudeau a ladder so he can climb out of the deep holes he always puts himself in
he rejects actual reality and substitutes his own.
Who on this good earth really cares what Trudie is thinking!
Votes matters 🤷
Because to do so would make him look like an idiot and he needs to court voters?
"Like, who gives a fuck what he is ready to accept:)"
That’s fair I’d give the odds 50/50 that Israel did something they don’t want to admit to vs a black market weapon went wrong
the USA scares me
FFS
Holy shit! Trudeau is actually using his brain. He said something that is actually true and won't please his woke friends around the world. What is happening??????
Even if it was from Hamas it's understandable that they would blame Israel when Israel has bomb hospitals before
Smartest thing this idiot has done all year.
Such a drama queen
"Omg, the only country that came out to support Canada with the Indian murder was the US, and this is what you say. Another liberal shot in the back again,  wtf"
Looks like Israel doesn't have anything to blackmail him with.
"Hard to know what is true. After everything that has happened with this liberal government, it’s impossible to leave Trudeau."
"Maybe he should resign, take a trip to Gaza, see how they made water pipes to rockets, look at how many billions were send to Gaza and how it looks - he also should take a look where Hamas stores it's weapons, take a look the hamas ""schools"" where they make future terrorist...the list could go on almost endless

A lot of money from the west directly hoes to Hamas, Hamas uses hospitals schools and kindergartens for launching self made rocket which have a failure rate of 10-20% - yes it is more likely that a Hamas rocket malfunctioned than that Israel bombs a hospital courtyard"
Dumb
This government is such a pile of poo that even the left US doesn't trust them.
"Israel did this, make no mistake, targeted. this was no hamas made artillerly, hamas rockets have no locking/target lock-on ability. this was a targeted hit.

"Of course, the voter base he's trying to woo and the people he's bringing to this country would riot."
I'm not concerned with what Trudeau is willing to accept. He's not running a serious government anyway.
[deleted]
Because it is not. The evidence IDF provided was nothing but lies.
He needs to zip it
🌚: “…Uh…umm…uh…ahhhhh…”
So much for not our government not weighing in. Guess what you don't piss off anyone if you keep your opinions to yourself.
"God, fuck this fucking fuck…."
"His comments about ""preliminary evidence"". Like, I'm *pretty* sure that he's referring to Twitter and didn't actually look at anything before condemning Israel for something that didn't happen. This is 100% political! 

I really hope that hospital parking lot appreciates the time Trudeau is taking to *decide* on whether or not facts matter."
"We should not take any side in a war!!! Be like Swizerland. Not taking part of ukrain war or palastinia war. We should fix our housing problem and fuck the rest
 I need money and will be homeless soon"
Usa give information to canada the way they want canada to believe
"There is reports saying it was an accident... there's is zero saying it was on purpose...

The other option being thrown out by the US was it was 3rd party"
I think after the debacle of the media in believing and peddling that lie that Israel bombed that hospital we should all take some time to actually see the facts of the situation before who did what.
We know nothing
Trudeau is a confirmed redditor I guess
Plo
Can I get a hot TL;DR?
Both may be responsible as israel for months was sabotaging guidance systems of missile parts coming into Gaza.
Do we expect the US to a credible moderator?
I think we're expected to go to war over this
"Yeah well there was that whole thing about those weapons of mass destruction, wasn't there?"
I don't trust a word from anyone here.
"Look guys, it’s not a question, anyone can watch the video of the Hamas rocket launching and then crashing on geolocation of the hospital.

It’s been days, you can see images of the parking lot being hit and the hospital itself intact.

There was no JDAM which you can easily see on IDF videos flattening housing structures easily.

This is sticking your head in the sand."
"Hamas was not behind the explosion at the hospital, but they were beside it as they used it as civilian cover, launching rockets into isreal."
"He shouldn't be commenting on stuff he doesn't know about. Since both sides are doing horrible things to each other, maybe just stay out of it?"
glad we aren't going to find out next time foreign agents kill someone in Surrey because of this blunder. /s or am i?
"You guys still believe in US propaganda? They lied about Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Lebanon, Ukraine. And all of a sudden theybare honest about Israel, the nation they funded and allied with? Grow up people. One thing you can be certain is no matter what, US always fight for their benefits , not justice or freedom and other bs they claim. 
If they were honest, they would intervene and stop global conflicts, not pour oil on them."
Looks like Mossad did a great job.
The only thing we know for certain is that we know nothing. The truth will take years.
"Remember the St Louis.  And the Alamo, too."
" I don't say this often, but good job Trudeau being smart enough to wait for the investigation to finish, instead talking the word of any invested parties."

"Weird trend nowadays where an invading force enters a country, a ton of infrastructure explodes, and then the invading force is just like “wE HavE NO iDeA aBouT aLl ThAt”"
"In a battle of religious fundamentalists, which this is, it's best to investigate every claim and then assume the worst once the less civilized guilty party has been identified as being responsible. Basically, Israel will use more sophisticated methods of cruelty and will be thinking of international politics when doing that shit. That stuff won't apply to Hamas. Their side will be far more brutal. They'll go so far as to blow themselves up, rape, and mutilate the enemy for shits and giggles.

Folks need to remember that in this conflict Hamas believes that their God has told them to purge all non-Muslims from the world and has a history of blowing themselves up and committing full on fucking atrocities to achieve this goal. Their goal is probably to cause a giant Arab uprising and bring about the complete annihilation of the Jews. 

The other side has a history of using their God ordained status to claim land and generally be controlling assholes who abuse power...but they aren't anywhere near as bad as Hamas and their allies are. 

I see tons of people picking sides and the sides are not equal. They are not equal at all."

Good on Trudeau to keep an open mind and not jump to conclusions.
"You shut up and do what you're told, pretty boy"
That's good.
Nor should he
"Trudeau's comments on this put me in mind of Chretien's ""A proof is a proof. What kind of a proof? It's a proof. A proof is a proof. And when you have a good proof, it's because it's proven."""
As someone living in the Middle East I still do not have even the slightest grasp on this complicated issue and have no opinion
Thinking canada has any relevance anymore. Laughable.
What a divisive title. OP you practicing for the papers or what?
Remember WMD supposedly in Iraq? Canada almost got roped into that war thankfully we didn’t.
"There are pictures on the ground showing it was a parking lot fire. Palestine definitely lied about 500 people dying (how could you even know it that quickly?), and that it did not in fact destroy the hospital.

There are pictures inside the hospital, it broke a few windows and damaged roofing."
the first smart statement to come out of his mouth in a long time
This was the way he should have gone about it when the news broke. Now the evidence is out and the events are clear.
"If he had waited for this info to speak and started with this, I would agree with you.   


But instead he dashed to immediately blame Israel for the attack, without waiting for any info beyond Hamas' statements and reporters who just passed it along.   


This seems more like Trudeau refusing to say he may have been wrong, than wisely waiting for more information."
"what this means is they aren't sharing their intelligence with us anymore

Edit: from +50 to -7 in 30mins , not strange at all"
"Interesting how the left has now found the virtue of cautious neutrality, after ravenously canceling all who disagree with them for a decade or so.  In many cases, with serious consequences without any due process.

In principle, I agree of course, but it’s pretty suspicious that all of a sudden people of the left are finding religion on free speech and such."
"He made his statement on ZERO evidence, but wants to hold off correcting the record until there's some multi year investigation?

This is why Canada has become such a clusterfuck."
He has access to far more intelligence than us.  I wonder if he knows something we don’t.
Keep working on figuring out who burned 5 cars on the parking lot
"What this means is that he shot his mouth off for the points and then turned out to be wrong, and he's so lacking in character that he can't admit that."
"It's fucking bullshit. 

They are openly saying, we believe the corroborated reports of the organization we label terrorists. We believe this missile, had a direct hit to a hospital and killed 500. 

It was not a misfired rocket that hit a the hospital's parking lot, whose blast radius was limited to approximately 2,500 sq ft, killed 500 people. (imagine 500 people in your home). The impact crater left from this ""Israeli bomb"" was under 2 feet deep and wide. Meanwhile all other impact craters are 10+ feet wide. The recorded call of terrorists saying it was an Islamic Jihad misfire.

   
Yet all this evidence saying the contrary from our Allies is not sufficient."
Ya i dont see the problem here lol.
"Absolutely

This is an issue where there's no winning, keep playing the confused card here, try and remain neutral, any side you aide with will about to tremendous backlash"
"Well the reality is JT in his zeal to appear as if he cares about ""marginalized"" groups has put himself in the pro-israel and pro-palestinian camps several times, and doesn't want to look like a hypocrite by coming out ""in support"", so while normally we'd expect JT to champ down on the bit over *any* progressive issue, the second an important progressive issue hits the dirt, he's going to cower and be as waifish as possible.

This is, of course, because JT doesn't give two shits about either - he cares about having the opinion that will get more votes, full stop."
It it? Because no hospital have been destroyed this is fucking dangerous what he's doing...
Don’t you wish he had done this with India as well????
"Did they go that route with India though. Justin ""Credible Evidence"" Trudeau"
"How dare you not believe what the US and Israel wants you to believe, smh

For real though, I'm not a fan of Trudeau but I agree he's not wrong here. There simply is no way to objectively know where that rocket came from, fog of war and propaganda are very real things right now and only a fool would be 100% certain it was one or the other."
ok then why was he so quick to condemn israel without all the facts?
Especially when it seems false https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/s/WLcuIs3nDG
"The best reports I've seen which are all terrible is a rocket may have been launched from Hamas..  but it might not have... but said rocket or missile (potentially from the see)... was intercepted by Israeli air defence. And then something it the hospital parking lot.

Edit: so basically 50/50"
"Yeah especially since the US is not a neutral player in this conflict.

They have been bankrolling israel and their millitary for decades."
I guess they could not show everything as there is tech US and Israel have they dont like to share?
"With Trudeau, it's best to assume pride over competence or caution.  History is an excellent indicator of that."
I'm sure world leaders are waiting with baited breath - said no one.
Incorrect
"Yup a measured response cognizant of the diplomatic boundaries.  Almost like someone who takes the job seriously, and not some caricature the far right projects.  I dislike a lot of his policies, but he doesn't come across dishonest.  At least no more than any other politicians."
is the u.s not our main ally
"The title of the article feels so misleading. Based on the body Trudeau is doing his due diligence, but the title seems to imply he’s being skeptical *specifically* of the israeli claim"
and we want India to believe what we showed them... Irony
"It isn't because it suggests the evidence is neutral. I'm sorry, you can wait to pass final judgment but also acknowledge that evidence on the ground doesn't match the seriousness of the claim."
"Justin hasn't seen the evidence......because no one will share it with him.

Maybe if he hadn't alienated all of our allies......no one takes this ass-hat seriously anymore......"
"IDF claimed credit for the airstrike and took it back when they realized how bad they fucked up.  Hananya Naftali tweeted victory for an IDF airstrike on the hospital then deleted it after when the damage report came out.  

Hananya Naftali is an IDF soldier as of OCT 9.  

[Naftali drafted](https://twitter.com/HananyaNaftali/status/1711291414946914551)

As of OCT 14, he was assigned to the Digital Warfare Task Force by Netanyahu himself, according to Naftali in this video:

[Naftali explains he is now part of the Digital Warfare TF](https://m.facebook.com/hnaftali/videos/i-have-been-called-up-from-the-frontline-to-another-front-the-digital-warso-from/867197738404877/)

The propaganda bots on Reddit are trying to downplay his position in the IDF and push the narrative that he is just an influencer and on OCT 17th he states that he got faulty information from Reuters.  However, he is clearly directly participating in operations as a soldier in the IDF, hand picked by Netanyahu.  He previously served as Deputy of New Media for Netanyahu for years.  

I can’t definitively say whether the videos and photos that came pouring out from a million sources are real or not, considering Adobe’s new AI suite can doctor then with undetectable manipulation.  

However, Occam’s razor suggests that the IDF’s Digital Warfare Task Force don’t need to get their air strike updates from Reuters and in this case, we should probably trust what the IDF has put out by accident.  Israel is lying and everything after their initial admission of air strike is bullshit."
This is rich after reddit the first night when it happened.
Now we play the waiting game to see how PP tries to spin this as Trudeau being anti-Israel or some shit.
"posted this in r/CanadaPolitics but this is the internet and I'm allowed to post the same comment in multiple places so here goes:

  
I think in isolation this is the right stance. My issue is that representatives of the liberal party have repeatedly classified this event as an ""attack"". Since the attacked side is Gaza this implicitly says that the attacker is Israel. Considering the amount of aggression that this currently unfounded and not-unlikely incorrect view has precipitated I think it is fair to be critical of the Liberals handling of this incident."
I would hope that we would avoid siding with terrorists.
"The USA and the UK have already confirmed that it was a militant rocket.

What Allies is he waiting on? China? India?"
Since the US didnt back up Canada when India murdered it's citizen I guess this is retribution
I just want them both to stop killing Israeli and Palestinian citizens.
"I'm picking the side ""Genocide is bad."""
"Agreed.  There doesn’t have to be a right and wrong side, being on the side of “no more killing” seems like the right choice"
The sad part is most on this Canada sub already picked a side
"It's not picking sides when you're just reporting the truth. 

There's no gray area in looking at evidence and coming to a conclusion of events. 

(But btw, it is sort of picking sides when one side says something and you immediately rush to make a statement, but when all evidence point to it being a lie - you stay quiet and when asked about it you say you're still looking through evidence as if these evidence can suddenly create an event that just didn't happen the way it was told)."
I see your point. I think it typically applies. But not here. Neutrality of genocide is being complicit.
This applies to most things. This sports team mentality with politics is dangerous. That you 'have' to pick a side.
"I'm picking a side: innocent people trying to have a meaningful life who are being used, displaced, injured, and killed in the name of politics."
Nice luxury to watch from the sidelines
"There's no good guys here, only bad guys and victims"
"This is what I've been trying to avoid but some people blatantly force you to choose sides by saying your silence says you've already chosen a side. 

I personally think that everyone loses in a war. There are no sides to choose... it's a bunch of fuckin terrorists and higher ups choosing to fight in a war for no reason. The civilian that just wants to go about their days are the most affected. 

I've heard it from a Syrian refugee best. ""I have friends on both sides, and neither of them wanted this."". People have their differences but they didn't choose to kill others that didn't agree with their beliefs."
"I'd also say it's not a bad thing to say ""i hate the bad actors on both sides"" (of the ballgame/whatever)."
"Yeah, that need to be said to conservatives mostly being that apparently to a lot of them not wanting innocent Palestinians to be killed = hamas supporter."
Little reminder that it shouldn't involve us at all.
Exactly. People are so desperate to label strangers on the internet as either supporters of baby-decapitation or hospital-bombing that the reality of the situation becomes secondary.
[deleted]
"> Little reminder that this conflict isn't a ball game. No need to pick a side

Imagine uttering those words one week after 9/11

Terrorists just targeted and slaughtered 1,400 civilians and kidnapped 200. 

""No need to pick a side""

Jesus fucking christ."
It isn't even a conflict. Was the Warsaw Ghetto  a 'conflict'?
"I dunno. One side beheads babies and parades raped women around, while their citizens all over the world cheer. 

The other just wants that to not happen again."
"I root for the one that didn't shoot first. Also, the one that didn't make the blunder of executing American hostages"
"You're right. You don't pick sides when one of them raped women, killed old ladies and beheaded babies."
"Yep, both sides are pretty awful."
this is giving “all lives matter”
"Well the thing is no one cared about Israel murdering all on Palestinian civilians for years now at a much larger number than hamas. I don't support what Hamas is doing, but why isn't there the same outrage when it's Israel killing the civilians?

I'm sure some would consider this ""picking a side"" but it's just the truth."
May both sides vanish alongside all religions
"little reminder, someone stole a land and forced people to turn into violence to take it back."
"To be fair, picking no side is exactly what the israeli government wants.  Don't get involved, stay where you are mind your own buisness that what they want you to do.  Israel is in the wrong and has been in the wrong for decades. Just simply watching without picking a side is virtually sitting and watching a genocidal occupancy taking place and not doing anything or standing for anything.  If your uneducated on the topic, sure, sit it out, but if you know what's going on, you have to do the right thing by humanity."
"I dunno, I think the civilians of Palestine are a solid side to pick. Locked into a small area and bombed heavily, including in refugee camps. 

To be honest, I think not picking that side is morally questionable."
Seriously? They were viciously attacked by a terror group. Way to try to make Israel as bad as terrorists.
"I think the word you were meaning to say was prosecution, you kept saying persecution.

[The difference](https://www.englishgrammar101.com/module-16/troublesome-words-2/lesson-24/persecute-vs-prosecute)"
"I mean sure ok, I suppose if you want to be reasonable that works, but have you considered the need to fuel the social media rage machine?"
"All the open source evidence points to Gaza with multiple video angles of the launch of their rockets in the direction of Israel and subsequent strike of only one of multiple they launched falling into a parking lot while the rest of the rockets continued into israel. It was geolocated for multiple videos to Gaza controlled territory 

Idk what more evidence people want 

Palestinians obviously hid the rocket fragments otherwise they’d be all over Twitter too, which is the normal thing that happened in Syria and Ukraine when they wanted to blame x party for a missile strike. But in the worst strike imaginable it’s suspiciously absent"
So the allegations were right. Russia.
"Great, I wonder why he did not take a similar mature approach regarding the murder of Nijjar."
We blamed Israel without evidence we can accept an intelligence report.
"Yeah tell that to the whole sub for the last week that went ""it was Israel"" now y'all are backtracking. Not you specifically but I came here a few times to straight antisemitism hard"
There is no doubt Hamas did it. None. If you actually followed the story you’d know that.
War crimes and the liberals? Are they looking to pin medals on them and give a heroes welcome to Parliament? Or is that just select war crimes?
[deleted]
"russia was involved, it was Russian missile system that was used, it was given to the separatists by the Russian government"
"That’s true, but I would like to note that the US has its own overhead surveillance of the area and they said that their current assessment is that it didn’t come from Israel; I imagine that’s easy enough for them to verify from overhead imagery. https://x.com/NSC_Spox/status/1714654402118832440?s=20
  
My personal suspicion is that it was an unfortunate accident/misfire and both sides are throwing out different narratives on social media to confuse and inflame tension. DFRLab says it’s been rampant: https://dfrlab.org/2023/10/12/in-israel-hamas-conflict-social-media-become-tools-of-propaganda-and-disinformation/
  
An accident in this kind of situation is especially dangerous, that was basically what the Cuban missile crisis was. So even if it were just an accident, it’s one that has been damaging to public peace around the world and we wouldn’t be in this situation if tensions weren’t so high."
"Attack on the hospital implies intent, not a mistake"
What alternative interpretation does his wording allow other than blaming Israel?
"I agree. 

It's like bashing someone for not forming an opinion based off an article headline before they read it."
They always are. At the end of the day they just want your click and that's it.
"I was *heavily* downvoted and was called an ""idiot"" for saying that world leaders should wait before releasing statements. There's a reason why statements are made in calculated fashions instead of off the cuff. This is a delicate international crisis."
"In an active conflict of any kind, there is a lot of chaos to account for so it's essential to not bite down and make sweeping declarations about the first report available. This is especially true of today where information travels crazy fast.

During one of the Jacobite rebellions that culminated in the Battle of Culloden, the conflict was reversed by a British spy in the Stuart high command who convinced everyone that a sizable British force was moving to intercept the rebel army on the march and the rerouting of the rebel army effectively cancelled the march on England. Today, acting on a claim like that without giving appropriate wait time would be asinine considering how much information we have available and can almost count on having available later. Sometimes restraint before speaking is important!"
[removed]
You mean the same caution they showed before the 40 beheaded babies claim?
"Israel has already bombed multiple hospitals and schools in the past few weeks, changed their story multiple times for this particular bombing, and have a history of lying about crimes against humanity. It's a pretty safe bet they did the deed."
Amazing how people would just assume that the side that has been using missiles and jets and bombs to systematically destroy Gaza would also be the ones who destroyed the hospital.
"The hospital says they were told to evacuate by Israeli military so idk.

https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hospital-explosion-3d255725997c4e2757372b3ee2fc8859

>The Anglican Bishop of Jerusalem, Hosam Naoum, said the hospital received at least three Israeli military orders to evacuate before Tuesday’s explosion. The warnings by phone began Sunday, after Israeli shelling hit two floors of the hospital, wounding four medics, he said.

>The staff at al-Ahli, like those of other hospitals across Gaza, refused the evacuation orders, saying that it would endanger the patients to try to move them, violating the medical vow to do no harm.

Wouldn’t be the first time Israel lied and tried to cover up war crimes."
If they haven't been blowing hospitals up the last few days maybe more people would be inclined to believe Israel didn't also blow up this one
And absolutely nobody condemning Hamas for using a *fucking hospital* to launch missiles from. By doing so they're exposing it to actual bombing from Israel because it loses any protection from the Geneva Conventions.
[deleted]
"Not the most shocking conclusion in the world considering more than 6,000 bombs have been dropped by Israel over the course of a few days."
"Considering Israel sent a warning, they would bomb the hospital then bragged about it after bombing it, it's pretty obvious they did it. All the evidence they've produced to say it was Palestinian's bombing themselves has been nothing but lies."
[deleted]
Insiders of Israel itself made those claims so what do you expect.
"And that... is how Israel got away with bombing a hospital.

Confused people into a 2 side thing and people let it be. 

Palestinians will continue to be bombed to unrecognisable pieces, will be forced to evacuate and Israel's map will expand.

If they fight back, fake news such as 40 baby beheadings etc will be spread and people will hate on the Palestinians."
"Al Jazeerah proved yesterday this was Israeli...

Also Israel has a long track record of lying. They're worse than China, how TF do people find them credible still."
"And was supported by Netanyahu in doing so. He was pursuing a divide and conquer strategy of having Hamas in Gaza and the PLO in the West Bank. It was also assumed that Hamas were zealous morons who would be ineffectual at attacking Israel. This blew strategy blew up in his face.

">with a combination of disinformation, manipulation, and violence

and up until a week ago - support from israel"
“We should rush to decisions when I agree with it”
"Israel has bombed dozens of hospitals already, including that one 3 days before this. There is no reason to believe they WOULDNT do this, and a member of Netanyahu’s staff initially tweeted that it was an Israeli air strike before deleting the tweet and posting a new one saying the exact opposite"
"You should always wait for evidence before having an opinion. Just because people were dumb before, does that mean you should be dumb now?"
"No. No one is saying you have to wait for evidence before having an opinion. Most opinions fly in the face of facts. However, before a conviction, you must have evidence."

">Everyone in the house of commons was quick to call out Israel when reports first started.

I don't think that's true."
Ive been looking from statements where anyone from our government blamed israel prematurely for the attack and i cant find them. I think some news sources maybe did? But not any of our government officials.
It's so disgusting that the best way to capture the muslim vote is by echoing Hamas propaganda and not retracting when all evidence points that it's a big lie
Do you have an actual source on that happening?
Show me some quotes where those people directly said Israel bombed the hospital.
"Yeah, when you make a snap judgement and are proven wrong, you shouldn't swap to another snap judgement. You should learn from the mistake and spend more time analyzing the situation."
"All the evidence still points to Israel, stop spreading disinformation."

"You meen the Nazi lovers in the house of commons were quick to blame Israel?

Obvious sarcasm, but you're absolutely correct."
"“I ain’t saying she an antisemite, but…”"
"Israel is balls deep in a disinformation campaign. Much of their “evidence” has proven to be false/ incorrect. Such as the phone call between jihadists claiming that it was a PIJ rocket. This is not to say believe what Hamas is saying, rather we will just have to wait until a third party can get in their to do a forensic investigation. We should not trust what either Hamas or the IDF claims because both sides are consistently spreading lies"
40 beheaded babies.
Who exactly blamed Israel?
"You’re right, the time for caution has passed and what was said caused too much damage already. Not trusting and supporting your allies at this point is a critical mistake on a national security scale."
"Yes? That's exactly what the take away should be.

If your response to being presented with counterfactual evidence to wildly swing in the other direction then you've learned nothing. 

Saying ""maybe this isn't as clear cut as it first appeared let's actually do our due diligence now"" is about as reasonable as you can be."
its totally rational to blame them at first a. They are the ones bombing the region with an underrepresented amount of bombs B.They have done things like bomb the Rafah crossing and are not direct at saying yes then eventually admit to it C. Brazenly lie about beheaded babies
Lol idf propaganda bot. Rememebr when Israel shot a reporter in the head and claimed in was Palestine? Oh yeah then they admitted 3 months later it was them…
"What evidence? An awful phone call with accents, awfully fake conversations? and they bleeped their names for safety reasons? It took them a day to put that together instead of immediately posting it too lol. 

And when they posted footage, it had different time stamps from the attack. Then they removed the videos from the day of attack from their tweet.

One of the israeli government officials tweeted IMMEDIATELY confirming it was them bragging about it then removed the tweet and blamed it on Hamas.

They also bombed the same hospital on Saturday

warned previously to civilians to get out because they were planning to bomb the hospital.

They have bombed 22 hospitals previously

Bombed gaza so far with 6000+ missiles in the first day and bragged about it.

the missile that hit the hospital sounds EXACTLY like every other missile attack from Israel.

And, they were running a bombing campaign at the same time that Hamas shot rockets when the hospital was bombed. (Flashing lights in the sky, not the rockets flying up)

AND THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT HAS LIED ABOUT BOMBING AND MURDERING CIVILIANS IN THE PAST AND THEN A WEEK LATER AFTER THE INVESTIGATIONS CONFIRMED IT, THEY ACCEPTED THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE ON THEIR PART

But you’re putting your trust on corporate media entities, Biden, and the Israeli governments word

Also, US vetoed a request for ceasefire in the UN to allow humanitarian aid to go in. Idk, you’re brainwashed like the other troglodyte redditers"
Do you have a source for the disinformation you’re posting?
500 dead but it hit a parking lot. So either 500 people were in the parking lot for no reason or that hombre is also BS.
Jumped all over the same intelligence about plumbers
"Pretty hard to trust anything we're being told from both sides. There was a journalist a few days ago saying ""This is the biggest mis/disinformation campaign I've ever seen in my time in doing this work."" Information is being weaponized."
"you should be more skeptical of any claims that come from a terrorist organization.  They tried this same thing a few days ago falsely claiming Israel destroyed a church.

"Then what about the multiple claim from 3rd part that are usually right that came out less than 6 hour after? You are trusting terrorist over Israel, USA, and multiple reputable 34d party like geoconfirmed. Its embarras in behaviour."
"Last year the IDF bombed and killed 5 kids playing in Gaza, and blamed it on a failed PIJ rocket. The same thing they’re doing now; i guess Palestinian Islamic Jihad sounds scarier than Hamas. The IDF [later admitted](https://mondoweiss.net/2022/08/after-initially-blaming-palestinians-israel-admits-to-airstrike-that-killed-5-children-in-gaza/) they had killed the five children."
"The claims don't come from Israel, they come directly from Biden's mouth. When asked why Biden should take Israel's word on this he emphatically says he isn't using Israeli information but rather his own DoD sources. Further, Hamas can't produce any evidence that 500+ people died & daylight suggests a hospital was directly hit. But yes, continue to believe there isn't sufficient evidence to make an initial claim. You're never going to get ""admissible in the court of law"" evidence in a war zone but have to accept that 95% certain is probably the best you're going to get, which Biden gave you."
"""Jews control the U.S. government.""   


Upvotes coming in hot."
They also bombed the same hospital last Saturday and called the head doctor in the hospital asking him to evacuate all the patients (where to put people that are intubated? Who knows?)
"They also bombed a civilian convey after telling them to evacuate, these people are pure evil."
">It's super weird to see ""Canadians"" in r/Canada celebrating some weird idea that Trudeau is some pariah on the world stage.

"Bots, astroturfing."
I speak Arabic and I can tell you the conversation that the idf released claiming to be Hamas is 100% fake and staged. Palestinians do not speak with that accent
Iron Dome does not intercept on accent. It's good but not that good. Also not that fast. This investigation are just more lies.
"AJ has already made a a bold video showing the IDF theory to be straight up propaganda

"To be completely fair to Al Jazeera, they will absolutely jump on any opportunity to cheer and take responsibility for bad things happening to Israel. It absolutely is not in their nature to attempt to deny responsibility, and they're liable to celebrate *anything* bad happening to Israel regardless of the cause."
What evidence
Not really a small issue when the jump to blame Israel caused global reactions including attacks on embassies and increased protests on streets which have at times been violent.
"Because as a Canadian, I'm interested in my prime minister's take on an active war."
It’s the best intelligence agency in the world so imagine how little weight what anyone else says carries. Not to mention there’s a video of it and it’s not just the US stating it was from Gaza.
22 years ago?
"Intelligence was bypassed to some degree for the WMD thing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Special_Plans

Also there are counter-examples like Ukraine where US intelligence was on point."
And the same US president who woke up from a nap thinking he'd seen photos of babies being beheaded.
The US and British back Israel unquestioningly which is weird given the history of the USS Liberty and the King David hotel.
"All the expert analysis I've seen points to it being a JDAM. Not even taking into account Israel's history of lying about its atrocities and manufacturing fake ""proof""."
"There's definitely a nationalist slant here.

I imagine that's the case for lots of country subreddits, but when I look at UK, Ireland, Iceland, etc. on occasion, I don't see the same bias. Maybe I just don't have the cultural context to identify it."
"Channel 4 in Britain has a well balanced video on the hospital explosion:

https://www.channel4.com/news/who-was-behind-the-gaza-hospital-blast-visual-investigation"
Military experts say the sound of the explosion was consistent with that of a US made missile.
"And the video of Bigfoot is conclusive too!  

Video is no longer a reliable source of information"
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/19/what-hit-ahli-hospital-in-gaza
"To be fair, Israel did a job discrediting themselves lol. They shouldn't have bothered releasing those ""audio recordings"" because a lot of critics have already pointed out that they aren't speaking in the right accents. Also, it is very difficult to see what actually happened in the video. The theory about the rocket's debris falling onto th hospital after the interception is a bit questionable as well because in the time between the interception and the explosion, it's unlikely a lot of debris would've been able to reach the ground.

A lot of pro-Israeli accounts are also claiming that the lack of a crater indicates there was no airstrike but Israeli JDAMs have the ability to explore before actually reaching the ground so that argument doesn't have too much merit it seems.

Doesn't help that an official Israeli Twitter account have edited its post to remove the ""video evidence"" once people pointed out that the timestamps didn't match up right.    There was also an unofficial pro-Israel account that made a Twitter post celebrating the attack for killing terrorists but then deleted the post just minutes later. An Israeli airstrike is also consistent with some many reports that he hospital was contacted and told to evacuate but I'm not 100% sure if that's verified yet.

I'm not saying it's a confirmed rocket malfunction on the Palestinian side but stuff just isn't adding up at the moment so I think it's a bit early to come to a conclusion.

Edit: lol I knew the downvotes were coming"
Let’s be honest western media isn’t the most reliable. The bias and propaganda is unreal
"I mean, we could believe the people that have faked audio."
but they'll believe the US or Israel 😂😂
Al Jazeera is a mouthpiece
"Biden said in his speech that ""the other team"" did it so it's pretty clear where the lines are getting drawn now at least from a US perspective"
Source?
Who said anything about jews?
"I'm sorry, but the difference between ""40 murdered babies, some of them were beheaded"" and ""40 beheaded babies"" is much smaller than the difference between ""Israel bombed a hospital"" and ""Islamic Jihad accidentally killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians with their own rockets"""
Or the 14th SS (Galician) Division .
"Also gotta remember that the US and Israel are too close an ally to let some facts get in the way. 
Similar to Iran and Hamas being close, it’s very hard to just believe what a government is saying because we are being peppered with propaganda from both sides."
"don't think anyone would take seriously if hamas provided 'samples' for investigation.  israel has been blasting gaza for days, the easiest item for a scavenger hunt would be pieces of spent israel munitions.

so no value in the samples... and the source is anything but trustworthy."
"What the fuck is wrong with the media for attempting to turn this into a divisive story.

I hate Trudeau but this monkeyfuck war shouldn’t occupy so much of our periphery here in Canada."
"Trudeau is very pro-Israel?

He was initially supportive of Israel, but not necessarily in a way that I’d characterize as “very pro-Israel”"
Wondering if he merely doesn't want to alienate his Middle-Eastern voting block.
">If the evidence was so clear he would just side with the US and Israel on this.

The exact quote is different than the headline. Here: ""'We saw some preliminary evidence but we'll keep working with our allies,' Trudeau says"".

That could mean anything. Even Israel isn't blaming Hamas - their account is that it was fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). The rocket certainly seems to have come from Gaza, but know actually that it was even accidental. I don't read any assignment of blame on Israel in his comments at all - even the original statement condemning an attack on a hospital is hardly different than Biden's."
"He's not pro-Israel lol

None of our leaders are."
If we were attacked by terrorists we'd be happy for the support of our friends and allies.
"Because the antisemitism and islamophobia from there has spread here.

And it's just going to get worse if Israel decides to carry out this 'siege'."
Too late. The British/French/UN decided to draw a lot of straight lines in the Middle East and here we are.
Don’t forget they lied about the baby beheadings.
"Channel 4 TV station from the UK has a well balanced video on the hospital explosion and the Israeli narrative may not be as accurate as they claim.

https://www.channel4.com/news/who-was-behind-the-gaza-hospital-blast-visual-investigation

how do you *really* feel?
the US would never admit Israel was at fault even if they had the evidence to prove so
"Have you seen the photos from the impact crater? That wasn't a high yield military grade explosive. Its barely a foot across and a few cm deep, any kind of Israeli ordinance would have left a significantly larger crater. 

Not to mention, clay tile roofs less than 40ft away on the hospital were barely damaged.

It looks like the majority of the damage was caused by the ignition of unspent fuel in the failed rocket, that cascaded through a parking lot engulfing vehicles with more fuel in them.

The hospital wasn't even hit, or really by the looks of it damaged."
He’s literally just making a statement. Chill.
">This guy is such an absolute tool. It’s no wonder the U.S. has started to simply not care about him or what he says, he has no sway

The U.S. also acknowledges the source is still disputed even though they believe it was IJF.

Was there not Canadian troops on the ground? Or was that just Afghanistan?
"I literally deployed and saw Canadian units in Iraq what do you mean, I actually think the longest sniper shot in Iraq was by a Canadian lol"
"Idk who’s lying about what but American news media is still running with the 500+ dead narrative but assigning those deaths to Hamas. Call it propaganda, call it fog of war but I have noticed a lot of fuckery in the media and it’s really reminding me of the Iraq war days."

"""Palestinians""?  You mean Hamas. 

And I hope it's true.  I know most people here are rooting for their favorite ""team"", but if it means in fact 500 people didn't die, that's awesome news."
"There were people in the court yard.  There are other images of burnt out walls, in the back of the hospital.  

I truly hope that Hamas is using this for propaganda, if this means that in fact the casualty count was much lower."
There are even pictures of the rocket being launched and then coming back down. It's disappointing but not surprising how quickly the media took the outrageous Hamas claims seriously.
"Waits minute, the Palestinian’s lied!?…. Who would’ve guessed that 🙄"
">  (how could you even know it that quickly?),

There's so much misinformation nowadays"
For sure they lied about it.  But what’s funny is how the media reacted to the “report” .  It’s not like their credibility was already in the gutter
That isn't true. MSF has been reporting large numbers of people sleeping on hospital grounds.

"Literal thousands of children dead, video proof of doctors practicing and finding their children dead with the casualties brought in - nothing. No push back on Israel. 

But maybe 500 people exactly did not die in this bombing. Those fucking Palestinian dogs, how dare they try and trick you. 

Fucking hell."
"Both parties are lying, Hamas trying to push the terrible hospital masacre, Israel changind the narrative 4 times in a single day (there was Hamas people in the hospital, to there was in a parking lot, to it was a hamas failure) and all the western media pics what they want of all of this to make us not hate their wage payers and also grab our attention. 

In moments of war first you have one sided propaganda. If that doesn't work, you let both sides of propaganda run wild till the point of absurdity, so the audience doesn't know what's happening and don't trust anyone so just go with their country."
"Over 1200 dead. People were under rubble, numbers weren't known until they stared pulling bodies out. And no Hamas hand made rocket who be able to take out a whole hospital, put aside isreali called and warned the hospital 3 times that they were going to bomb. But people and patient had no where to go...  if you have tik tok. Type free Palestine, and you'll see exactly what's going on in there. First hand not no fake propaganda. And stop watching America news."
"Source. make a claim.

provide a source.


Or STFU"
But there are two tweets from Israeli officials saying that they bombed it.
"Naftali (israel spokesperson) literally tweeted about bombing the hospital, then DELETED the tweet, then blamed hamas..

https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cyi13fmrzwv/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

you want pictures and videos of the bodies?? there’s certainly no shortage of those going around.."
"
""The hospital is owned and run by the Anglican Church.

Canon Richard Sewell, the dean of St George's College in Jerusalem, told the BBC that about 1,000 displaced people were sheltering in the courtyard when it was hit, and about 600 patients and staff were inside the building.""
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67144061

So it is possible a significant number were killed in what we're crowded conditions in the courtyard."
[deleted]
"They know approximately how many people were in the car park before the strike, you have to make estimations in war and Palestinians don't have the resources of a state.  Different weapons do different damage, Israel has also been targeting vehicles and you don't use jdams for that. You think they don't have e.g. thermobaric type weapons and wouldn't use them to wipe out a group of refugees looking for safety in a hospital car park?"
"I mean, there were literal physicians on the ground, treating the patients, that gave this number."
"> Palestine definitely lied about 500 people dying

\*hamas"
Yeah and you can watch Channel 4's investagation about it.  It's a bomb used to cause mass civilian casualties.  Channel 4 has absolutely doubled down on their claim the attack was Israeli.
"You could know that quickly if there were 500 people in there... Right?

Like if a plane with 150 people in it crashes and no one is walking around afterwards you could pretty easily say 150 people died.

Or if there's about 10 people maybe walking around you could say ""over 100"" pretty comfortably."
Cause you’re so informed about the details right?
"You think Israel and the US can't fabricate videos of a parking lot on fire. The Palestinian rockets are barely fireworks, they can't destroy buildings and kill 500 people.  And yes 473 people died, but hey you believe CBC so wtv makes you sleep at night."
"Clearly the 500 figure is inflated, but please refrain from saying there was only a few windows broken. You can guess how it makes you sound."
Imo he's always been pretty solid at international issues. The party can't seem to figure out Canada though...
Most of what he says is fine. Media headlines are what always make him sound awful. Remember all politicians at that level have professional speech writers.
"I just hope we wake up to the world around us and not live in fantasy anymore.

We immigrated a housing crisis.

We immigrated ourselves in the middle of the Sikh independence movement and the India Hindu Nationalist movement.

Let's tighten up immigration and the ""refugee"" and ""asylum"" systems and not inherit more fucking problems that shouldn't be a thing here in Canada."
"It's not evident to 15 experts bbc uk asked. 9 hasn't replied, 3 said not sure, and all the other 3 could manage is ""not consistent with*usual* Israeli strike""."
Where did he blame Israel? All I could find was Trudeau condemning the attack...none about who he's accusing
"> But instead he dashed to immediately blame Israel for the attack

In fairness, Israel also immediately blamed themselves for the attack."
"You know they hAve a habit of killing doctors kids and bombing civilians and get away with it , fuck sake a sniper shot a doctor dead years ago treating kids and he was clearly marked as a doctor , the only reason there was so much uproar is because he was fucking British , the Isreal government deserve people jumping the gun , but ……. Next time this happens it will be brushed off"
They literally just shared information with us about a domestic assassination. Where do you guys even come up with this stuff? 😂
Streeeeeetch
Or that we don't trust the US to provide unbiased intelligence about their key middle Eastern ally. Either way I think it's a sensible take.
Not sure I trust American intelligence.   Remember when they said that there was proof Iraq was involved in 9/11 and then when they changed that to saying there was proof of WMDs?  Remember how that all came out to be bald faced lies? I'm all for demanding to see the real evidence and not just taking preliminary evidence or their word for it.
"Canada isn't reliable or they act too hastily when info is shared. As consolation, they've also looped New Zealand out of certain updates"
Is biased information actually intelligence?
Who could blame them ? Not sure I'd let Justin borrow my car for a few hours.
"Or they are lying to prop up an ally. That's not on Canada, or Trudeau."
You nailed it.  And for good reason.  We are on the outside.
Bingo.
"What are you going to do with it?

It’s not intelligence if you tell the other side what you know."
"Like anyone gives a shit what Trudeau believes.

Why does he think anyone cares?"
"You need evidence to say ""hospital attacks bad""? He doesn't need to correct anything unless you mean ""hospital attacks good""?"
"I'm sorry, what record is he supposed to correct? The one where he doesn't blame Israel?"
Yes. He condemned bombing hospitals without verifying personally a hospital was bombed. What an asshole am I right? Boy that alone has ruined Canada. We’re the worst country on the planet now /s
Lol
"If Israel is responsible here, it would have to be the biggest coincidence of the millennium here. 

It would mean that Israel flew with fighter jets during a rocket barrage, dropped a bomb that is completely different than what they've used so far, at the exact same time (to the second) that a PIJ rocket failed (or was shot down if you believe that narrative), at the exact same location that the rocket fell and cause the exact same damage a rocket might cause. and also fall directly on 800 civilians standing on top of each other for the damage to also be close to what Hamas reported.  

I'm not a math guy, but I feel like the odds would be pretty slim here."
Do you think he should rush to judgement before we have the facts? Isn't that part of the problem?
"Ya they’re not saying that at all

It’s smart for Canada to be skeptical and play neutral for now.

It’s not the first time the US has lied to Canada about acts of war"
"Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's not the way to go nor is it ""smart"". 

Hamas: ""Israeli Air Strike bombed hospital, kills 500 civilians"".  
Reality: ""Small ornament hits ground outside the hospital, kills 10-20 civilians"".   


So let's even put aside the ""fault"" here, the rest is also a lie. Not 500. No damage to the hospital itself. AND WHAT FUCKING evidence do you need more of it other than your own fucking eyes? It's pictures. Clear as day. Taken by Palestinians in the area. 

Then we move on to fault - And here I can be okay with not being 100% conclusive, maybe Israel has a very small ordinance rocket they drop that somehow looks exactly like the damage from a rocket. And maybe that Israeli ""bomb"" also falls with shrapnel that looks exactly like a failed rocket. And maybe Israel is so good at timing it that they flew and dropped the bomb at the exact same moment PIJ launched a barrage of rockets at Israel, and hit the ground at the exact same timing as the PIJ rocket failed and dropped down.   
That's a lot of maybe, but fine, maybe. Who knows. It definitely makes more sense to trust a terror organization over our 2 closest allies on this, based solely on their words against countless evidence our allies put forth. Maybe they fornicated all of it, who knows.

&#x200B;

But if that's the argument - If that's the line we're going with from now on. I expect us to believe every criminal from now on about everything, and throwing doubt about everything. Oh, you're saying I murdered my girlfriend? And you have her body, the murder weapon that fits exactly to a special knife I tend to use every day, pictures of me entering her house with that knife, a phone call of my friends talking about how I killed her, and my criminal record where I also already killed multiple people in the past with that weapon and how I also almost killed another girlfriend in the past with that weapon? Well, I'm saying she's not even dead, she's sleeping in my apartment and it was her sister who killed her with a gun. 

&#x200B;

Sorry for the rant, I'm just completely and utterly tired of reading this ""just asking the questions here"" narrative and ""he said, she said"". You want to be equal, bring forth countering evidence of some nature that actually explain how it's Israel. And also, don't lie about the outcome completely to begin with, and I might be more inclined to believe it in some way."
AJ lol. We checked our own and found nothing.
The fact that this is a hot take is what's wrong with this whole mess. I cannot believe the lengths people go to to justify thinking that statement is somehow offensive to either side of this.  I am against terrorism and also against breach of international law...how can those two things not be true at the same time?!?!
"Yup, I'm picking the side that hasn't killed kids, which isn't Hamas or the IDF. 

That just leaves the innocent Israelis and Palestinians caught in the middle of this shitshow."
Does it? Seems easy to say but reality often excludes “no more killing” as an option
"So you’d be Switzerland in WW2? Nazis or Allies, hmmmm I can’t decide…"
[deleted]
"I agree, we should've said this a long time ago and now we could all be enjoying vacation theme parks in Europe designed by lead architect Albert Speer! Great call dude! /s

lol."
"Definitely, but also setting up the future to prevent the killing that started this all.  It’s easy for most to say but if someone broke into your house and raped and killed your wife/daughter and possibly beheaded your newborn you may not be in the same mindset."
One could argue no more killing is a side (with the other side being more killing)
"Actually, we are only in this mess because of that policy. If we let them kill each other decades ago, mathematically, more people might have been spared than killed."
Tell that to hamas.
"Ya you know how you get no more killing? By wiping Hamas off the face off the earth because their chant is from the river to the sea - aka kill all Jews. 

If isreal stopped fighting, there would be no isreal. If Palestine stopped fighting, there would be peace. 

You can either pick a side or be a Nazi. There is no third choice."
No more killing … until there is more killing.
"> There doesn’t have to be a right and wrong side

This is an absolutely insane take after what happened. I can't believe the world we live in right now."
"No more killing or oppression. If this stops and israel still treats palestain this way, another hamas will come along."
"That’s where I am, and just because you’re against bombing civilian neighborhoods doesn’t make you a Hamas sympathizer. 

After reporting where a Likud member said horrific things, I was leaning toward Israel did it simply because they were dropping bombs on civilians already.

It seems this was a Hamas misfire, but I still have doubt. Israel has been careless in the past and I leave the majority of all this in those who hold the most power; even in the face of this horrendous terrorist attack. 

This is complicated and people with dualistic minders need to take a step back."
"A lot of killing needs to be done before we reach that point. I'm in favour of No More Gaza Strip instead. We can relocate people instead. If there's nothing to fight over, no reason to fight."
"Isn't it funny though how the side of ""no more killing"" only ever seems to show up *after* a bunch of Israelis, Arabs as well as Jews, have been massacred yet again? 

They're never around to demand that Hamas be cleaned out once and for all and prevent future death and atrocities by a regime that's every bit as evil and genocidal as the Nazi Party was. It's *almost* as if it were actually a dishonest and cynical political ploy.

There was a time when people understand that you could abhor violence and killing but also that some political groups, movements, and regimes simply could not be allowed to exist. Nobody was out there demanding we stop oppressing the Third Reich, provide them with supplies rather than blockading Germany, and claiming the siege of Berlin to eliminate Hitler once and for all was ethnic cleansing."
"Amen!!

If Israel was guilty with substantial proof I would have no problem saying they fucked up in the face of this much conclusive evidence.

I have never seen the burden of proof need to be this high. Yes, stakes are high , but the evidence is conclusive"
Sure but the issue is that there’s no reliable sources in any of this. Choosing to believe something 100% without verification is choosing a side.
"All evidence, such as?"
It'd be a shame to waste it.
[deleted]
Imagine thinking this conflict started on Oct 7th
"This has a more complex history than the run-up to 9/11. Certainly Hamas are not the good guys, but the Palestinian people are suffering too. The side I pick is the level-headed and humanitarian one; why deify some state?"
[deleted]
You're late to the party. Get in line.
Those are 2 different groups
You just described both sides lol
Thanks for the propaganda chief.
[removed]
"Already proven as a lie. But one side has now killed  4200 people in Gaza. 👀 unless you believe collective punishment is justified, cause if so, you are by definition asking to be called a war criminal."
You're talking about Israel right?
"Let’s not pretend the entire Israel-Palestine issue started on the 7th of October. If you care about what you just said, Israel could provide you with a very long list of such atrocities they have been committing for 75 years."
You just described the leaders of both sides
"Except that those things you're describing, happen to Palestinians at the hands of Israelis, too. 

There are no innocent sides in this conflict.  

This started as a land-based conflict, that became an ethnic/sectarian issue. The solutions involve BOTH sides making concessions, that right now ain't happening until war criminals are held accountable, including Israeli generals who order strikes on civilian population."
Still keeping up with that BS lies and propaganda. did you all see the pictures just like Joe Biden did. Right
">They were viciously attacked by a terror group. 

Did this conflict start 2 weeks ago for you?

>Way to try to make Israel as bad as terrorists.

They are."
"Thank you internet stranger, my bad. I'll make the edit, to avoid confusion."
Agreed. We should definitely jump to a conclusion in this and every other case.
They want to be there and witness.
"Most experts bbc uk asked came back with ""there is not enough evidence to say something conclusively"".

How are you so sure?

All you have heard is so called proof from people potentially responsible and their biggest ally, USA."
"They want to somehow be teleported there to watch the missile with their own eyes. 

Sooooo pretty much they won't accept anything."
"They don’t actually want evidence.

Guaranteed this guy hates Israel, and was parroting the claims that Israel attacked the hospital. Now that there is overwhelming evidence (including a videotaped admission by the terrorists - what the hell!), he thinks that by saying “I want to wait for the facts to come out,” not only does he feel like he’s superior to everyone, but he will also continue to believe that Israel was responsible. He knows that they aren’t, but pretending he’s “still waiting for more evidence” is the closest he’s going to get to blaming Israel without being an explicit liar."
"Here's my hesitation: if it is clearly Hamas why would the IDF lie about it twice? They released a video that was debunked and removed, then they released an audio recording in with two ""Hamas leaders"" talking about how they did a terrorism in extremely fractured Gazan dialect. It also wouldn't be the first time the IDF have bombed a hospital. 

Either way, the expedient thing to do is wait until Canada can independently confirm, given how serious the allegation is. Part of the problem yesterday was people rushing to judgement without verification."
"Al Jazeera did a pretty good breakdown of how the supposed rocket was hit by an interceptor and that the video evidence doesn't really support either claim. It's not clear at all that that rocket caused the explosion since it pretty much disintegrated. Maybe the warhead survived and fell? But there were also airstrikes conducted in the area of the hospital at that time as well. We might not ever know what really happened. The death count is definitely suspicious though, the images the morning after don't look like 500 bodies were ever there."
">is that just select war crimes?

The term war crime is a joke.  Everyone just ignores the ones that the side they support commits, while using the ones the opposition commits as a way to call them barbarians."
"I don't think there's a shortage of missile fragments in Gaza right now, they could have come from anywhere."
It’s a war… people don’t play nice or by the rules
"Can you really trust that US will provide unbiased information, though? They did the funding for most of this war, after all."
"The one that really scares me is an errant rocket hitting Al Asqa Mosque/The West Wall

That could set off a massive conflict, no matter who’s fault it is"
The US is funding Israel lol... not exactly a neutral source
Israel claimed it and then removed the tweet remember.
They also didn't release their surveillance. It's normal to not take the US' word for granted when it comes to something in the Middle East.
I would like to Note that the us is not a neutral party in this conflict.
"Prior to this recent conflict, the FBI were trying to get permission from Israel to investigate the death of a Palestinian-American journalist and given the way that unfolded I think it's sensible to at least try to gain more facts first"
The US is one of Israel’s most staunch supporters. Do you really think they wouldn’t lie?
"it does - but its also the word you would probably be inclined to use when responsibility was hazy and the act in general was being condemned

i think it would have been better if he had chosen his words more carefully - but i also think he is well above par when it comes to being careful - to the point where he comes across as disengenuous at times"
"Technically if a Hamas rocket failed its attack, it was still part of an attack."
That Trudeau is not a good public speaker.
I’ll upvote you
💯 if you didn’t make an immediate statement you were assigned a side. Lose-lose
Not like IDF never lied right? (Shireen Abu Akleh)
"There were definitely lots of murdered babies. If the only dispute here is how horribly some of them were murdered in their beds and cribs, is that really an argument you think winds up reflecting well on Hamas?"
"Is the difference between beheaded babies, immolated babies, stabbed babies, and shot babies really so important to you?"
Amazing how the side that launched thousands of rockets from their territory would have some fall short and kill their own people.
"As opposed to the side that filmed themselves murdering kids?  Or the civilians spitting on corpses?  

I guess we know who the media is talking about when they say 3 day memories."
"I’m pretty sure if I can find the video you can as well. You gotta remember Israel’s rockets aren’t made out of water pipes, hopes and dreams. I doubt Israel’s rockets would fail to hit the target. You can legit see the thing detonate mid air then drop from the sky. At this point in the conflict, Israel would have nothing to gain from blowing up a hospital. From having world support from attacks on its civilians to condemnation for hitting a hospital? I’m pretty sure Israel and the US got this one right."
"they are not systematically destroying gaza.

they are systematically destroying HamAss."
"wouldn't be the first time HamAss accused Israel of destroying a sensitive building and lied. they literally did this a few days ago.

It's what they do every single time. Like it's a rinse and repeat tactic that we buy over and over and over again. We're dumb and it works for them so they will continue.
Israel is trying to get civilians to leave Gaza City. The hospital is in Gaza City.
"Are you saying that they have been ""blowing up hospitals""?"
"except...   
there was live al jazeera footage of the explosion showing outgoing missiles 3 seconds before the explosion   


and ...   
Israel had been so consistent in NOT bombing hospitals, that Hamas had put their HQ in one for at least the last 9 years (first reports 2009,verified 2014)  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Shifa\_Hospital#Use\_by\_Hamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Shifa_Hospital#Use_by_Hamas)  


all the while Hamas was not being shy about firing rockets from the hospital parking lot."
Not really given the thousands of rockets fired by Hamas. Some are bound to fall short.
"The BBC interviewed multiple experts [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67144061). While the BBC is hesitant to draw final conclusions, all the experts say that the video and blast are consistent with a rocket that misfired, in line with the IDF’s story. None of the experts suggest another explanation."
">Israeli officials claimed that they did it first

That's a pretty bold claim. Any proof?"
"""Insiders""

I assume that you are referring to the alleged post being spammed all over Shitter by some asshole social media influencer bragging about the hospital being attacked.

An asshole social media influencer does not constitute an ""insider""."
"But, the hospital wasn’t even bombed. The parking lot is scorched and a few cars are burnt, and it clearly wasn’t an Israeli JDAM as that would have left a crater. 

Seems weird we are arguing about who bombed a hospital when a hospital wasn’t bombed."
"But the hospital wasn’t hit, the parking lot was.  And where are the 500 dead?  And why do we have several videos from several different sources showing the rocket failure, and geolocation evidence and a wiretapped call saying it was PJ?"
"I don't think ""blew up in his face"" is really accurate in this case.  
Because of Hamas, Netanyahu got the excuse he's always dreamed of. Does it matter if his career is ruined if he ends up achieving the dream of the Israeli people?"
and hamas had their hq under a hospital for decades
What a ridiculous take. Hamas publicly and emphatically calls for the extermination of all Jews and the Israeli state. Israel has to defend itself from multiple unfriendly (and often attacking) neighbours. Israel is not the one committing a genocide.
"Listen to yourself, you're saying it's ok to believe the worst of Israel without evidence but not of Hamas and you're trying to claim I'm the biased one."
">On 14 October, Israel's military forensic teams attested that there were indications of torture and multiple rapes among the deceased.\[810\] In addition, one reserve warrant officer among them attested that the forensic teams had ""seen dismembered bodies with their arms and feet chopped off, people that were beheaded, \[and\] a child that was beheaded"".\[811\] Brigadier General Israel Weiss, the former IDF Chief Rabbi who led operations to identify victims, alleged that he had seen ""babies, women and men beheaded. I have seen a pregnant woman with her belly torn open and the baby cut out ... A lot of the women who were brought here were raped"".\[812\] Colonel Chaim Weissberg stated that they had found ""Young girls, elderly women, raped ... Soldiers and citizens whose heads were chopped off"".\[813\] Chen Kugel, the head of the Israeli National Center of Forensic Medicine, said ""We also have bodies coming in without heads, but we can’t definitely say it was from beheadings. Heads can also be blown off due to explosive devices, missiles, and the like.""\[814\]

I don't know man. They killed children in cold blood and dozens of them. Whether they beheaded them or not is kinda irrelevant and it seems reasonable to easily believe that anyone that can walk into someone's house and kill kids is also someone that is capable of decapitation. A lot of the bodies were tortured. This has been verified last I checked even if the specific detail of decapitation has not.

Do you deny they killed kids? There is not a single news source that denies Hamas killed children far as I can tell. So if you don't deny that part, why does it matter so much whether they were beheaded or not?

Same goes for the rape. You're innocent until proven guilty in Law. But if you are capable of killing HUNDREDS of innocent people at a music festival in cold blood it seems reasonable to conclude there is a high chance you are capable of other atrocities like rape as well. This is just common sense. It seems perfectly reasonable to believe women were raped until given counter-evidence precisely because we already have evidence of the mass slaughter and kidnapping that occurred.

If Hamas had only targeted the IDF and acted with discipline then I would say people shouldn't jump to conclusions about the rape and decapitation. That didn't happen. They acted as terrorists and explicitly wanted to invoke terror. Rape is an extremely common form of perpetuating terror on those you hate and has been throughout all of human history. It would be more surprising if rape did not occur given what all news sources have already verified Hamas did insofar as killing civilian and burning entire villages to the ground is concerned.

So most people aren't jumping to the conclusion that Hamas raped and decapitated because they're Arab. Most are drawing the conclusion because they slaughtered hundreds of innocent civilians. That's perfectly reasonable. \*Anyone\*that does that we can reasonably believe is likely also capable of decapitation and rape.

If your friend told you they were raped by someone that is a known baby murderer then it perfectly reasonable to believe they were indeed raped with lower required evidence because you already know the person is a baby murderer. You should wait for independently verified evidence before legally convicting, but just believing your friend in this situation is perfectly respectable from a purely evidence and reasoning point of view because you already know the person is a baby murderer."
"No one did it, people just imagined it / assumed from other countries that did assign blame"
I doubt that this would secure a vote. Trudeau screwed himself out of Muslim votes when he scolded Muslim parents after the million march for children. He won’t get those back.

It’s all vote bank politics and once the majority population becomes Muslim, you can kiss goodbye to Canadian freedoms. Or French. Or Swiss."

That guy is a social media influencer who works for the Israeli government as a social media aide. He’s not an official spokesperson for Netanyahu or the IDF. He also later retracted that statement.
"Propaganda is a huge part of making war. It has been since Ramses II erected monuments to his ""victory"" over the Hittites in the same region."
"There are very few people trying to pretend that Hamas is made up of good people.

The main point is that the apartheid inflicted on Palestine by Isreal very predictably leads to people fighting back as well as producing awful terrorist groups."
"Standard war propaganda is calling the people you don't like ""terrorists"" even as you're the one who's killing people.  If they're of a different religion then that's even better, as the Nazis well knew."

"I don’t live in Canada, just stumbled upon this post. And I can confirm that no one really thinks lesser or more of Canada because of Trudeau. 

Honestly, Canada isn’t a massive global player influencing the rest of the world in major ways, and so there’s not much talk."
"Canada's corporate media, Conservatives, and other right-wingers on here and /r/canada_sub have spent the last few weeks having a massive public meltdown over the Ukrainian war vet with Nazis ties who was invited to parliament by the speaker's staff, who did not do a proper background check on him, and trying desperately to blame all of that on Trudeau.

It's not all bots. Quite a lot of right wingers have Trudeau Derangement Syndrome.

The stupid part is that there's so many legitimate things to criticize Trudeau about - the housing crisis amplified by mass immigration policies, the lies over electoral reform, and doing nothing to stop all of the corrupt monopolies gouging regular people into the dust."

"They literally confirmed that a Palestinian rocket exploded right over the hospital, claimed that it was completely blown up into dust by iron dome (which never happens) despite iron dome not having the capability of shooting down a rocket within a few seconds of launch particularly on accent and despite no interceptors visible in any video  of the incident  (they always have bright  contrails) and then alluded to Israel bombing the hospital coincidentally within less than 5 seconds of intercepting it? Oh and despite the fact that the alleged target having a manhole sized crater and only cosmetic damage to the structure. 

If you believe that farfetched narrative, I have some magic beans I can sell you."
"Right and even they couldn't deny it. Just tried to shift some part of the blame to Israel. Even though even if the farfetched conclusion is true, Israel would be blameless."
Then it was smart of JT to sit back and wait for info to come out before making a judgement. Those protests and attacks on embassies would've happened either way.
"to be fair there’s been a lot to protest about israel’s conduct. this wasn’t the first hospital hit by an israeli strike this week. hell, it wasn’t even the first time *that* hospital had been bombed this week."
The best intelligence agency in the world means also being the best at propaganda and psyops.
the US would never admit Israel was at fault
"The US wasn't mistaken about the WMD reports, they knew that what they were saying is bullshit and proceeded to tell it with a straight face."
Lmao as if that matters? The same people are in charge of the US government
"Britain was responsible to create this mess, and the US supported it right from inception"
When has a terrorist group stated the whole truth? Why hasn't Hamas actually given real number of the dead.  They haven't listed the amount of Hamas fighters who died. The fact that the hospital deaths where supposed to be 500 but changed to 250 aprox after it was shown to be a missfired rocket.
"I’ve weaponeered and personally dropped many dozens of JDAM. Collected battle damage assessments from said drops. That damage/frag pattern is not consistent with even the smallest JDAM, not in the slightest. Not even close."
"Have you ever seen a JDAM hit? It destroys buildings, not  making some little bonefite that burns 10 cars, you wouldn't even recognize it as a parking lot if it was a JDAM.

Reason has left the building."
That’s good journalism
When you can geo reference activity from sat imagery it’s pretty conclusive. This isn’t Ai generated or what ever you’re trying to portray to support some narrative

"Live TV is live TV, I dunno how one can be so cynically stupid to deny what it shows, no matter where someones from. 

In this case its just legendary 🤣"

">The bombing of a hospital in Gaza was “absolutely unacceptable,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday, as federal officials confirmed Canada stands ready in Egypt to help people in the besieged territory get out amid a worsening humanitarian crisis

""Bombing"" very strongly implied it was done deliberately by Israel. As it turns out the hospital wasn't bombed at all.

He also said international law prohibits targeting hospitals. Hamas hitting a hospital, even accidentally, wouldn't be covered by international law because they aren't part of any government.

https://www.cp24.com/mobile/news/bombing-of-hospital-in-gaza-not-acceptable-trudeau-says-amid-conflicting-claims-1.6605204"
"Trudeau has been attending Israeli and anti-semitism awareness rallies this whole week, continuously says Israel has a right to defend itself...

I don't see how he's anti-Israel"
He has been nothing but staunchly supportive of Israel his entire time in office. Huh? He has pretty much been in line with the US which is very pro-Israel.
Is it even possible to be the head of a Western nation without kissing Israel's ring ?
"This. Liberals have a strong Muslim Canadian voter base. 

That support has already been strained by transgender issues. Suggesting that Israel did not blow up an entire hospital would cause them to bleed support to the NDP (those who care more about the transgender stuff) and Conservatives (those who care more about Palestine/Israel)."
"If it was a black and white situation, sure, but this situation is a fucking mess with both sides doing varying degrees of messed up shit. Picking a side in this war is certain to bite you in the ass eventually because one side does awful shit, the other does awful shit in retaliation and repeat. This has been going on for decades and it's not about to stop unfortunately."
Canada doesn't impose apartheid conditions on a neighbor though.
[deleted]
I honestly have no sides in this but I will say Palestine has gotten more deaths and been trampled for decades I can see why they’re fighting for themselves now. I don’t condone either side.
"That one ended up being true, actually. Though it’s less conclusive if all the beheadings were specifically with blades or result of explosives."
"If the Israelis hadn't put out such a glaringly obvious fake call, I would be 50/50 on who's responsible at this point."
Why would anyone support Hamas when it directly kills its citizens.  Hamas knows that rockets will be fired at launch sites and yet tell people to stay. They are nurdering thier own but Isrqel is bad....
check out r/worldnews they will perma ban anyone that isnt pro-israel
"[Yeah that crater is one of the main points, even bellingcat wrote about it](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/10/18/identifying-possible-crater-from-gaza-hospital-blast/)"
"Not an expert, but what kind of ground explosion pushes car roofs downwards ? 

Many people assert that the explosion was an airburst bomb, aka detonated midair, which would invalidate the misfire theory. 

Hence the small crater which would only be remnants from the bomb pushed downwards.

The crater thing isn't a convincing argument, knowing this. 

I'm merely reporting what I heard here I don't really care who did it."
"I’ve seen photos 


I’ve heard sounds 




I’ve seen the history of Israeli lies about bombing hospitals. 


Al Jazeera English and Channel 4 in the U.K. have both discredited the IDFs account.


I won’t believe anything but an independent UN investigation."
">He’s literally just making a statement. Chill.

lol Trudeau lives in his head rent free"
Lol. No.
the mental gymnastics on this sub is actually hilarious
"Yes, specially when Justin Trudeau + Jasgmeet Singh coalition was so quick to accuse India and cut diplomatic ties (we still haven’t seen any evidence).  All to appease the voter base in Western Canada.

So why this situation would be any different!!"
I'm just flatterd you think we have tanks.
Was that the Tim Hortons sponsored tank?
No they didn’t. The US has a team searching for them during the war and never found them. They later admitted they were wrong.
Your implication that the only reason we didn't get involved in Iraq is because we weren't militarily capable is incorrect. CSIS directly contradicted the claim that there were WMDs in Iraq.
"Jean Chrétien's government kept us out of Iraq, and that was probably the most important political act in my lifetime.

Stephen Harper, in opposition, and some Liberals (Paul Martin) would have giddily led us into that horrendous quagmire."
"I found this article:

""About a hundred Canadian exchange officers, on exchange to American units, participated in the invasion of Iraq. ""

So not officially under Canadian orders."
Afghanistan only.
"If Canadian forces were on the ground in Iraq, other than exchange personel then they were sheep dipped."
"Yep, lots of propaganda."
"Yeah, it is really strange how israelis keep getting killed, but palestinians seem to be dying of their own volition, and nobody is responsible for that."
All new has been fuckery for so long I’m really not sure why anyone believes anything.
"I don't trust the huge global powerful superpowers who have imprisoned 2 million people in a concentration camp where they control who exits and enters, what exits and enters, all internet traffic, all air, etc. 

I never trust the ones with the most power and capability when they say that they are threatened by those they're attempting to dehumanize. That they proclaim are weak, inhumane animals that need to be purged.

Seems sus to me."
"The 500 dead was the gaza health ministry casualties reported , so ZERO credibility"
"When big shit starts going down I disconnect and ignore most reports for awhile. Whether it be malice, ignorance or fear a lot of bull plop starts flying around."
Yep. It’s a good time for everyone to reread Manufacturing Consent.
"So lets first look at the rocket in question the [Khaibar-1]

according to this [picture](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BsL8-0nCMAE0EOa?format=jpg&name=small) from srtatfor in 2014 claims the rocket holds  a 150 KG payload.

You will also notice that since the missile does not spin its less stable and thus less accurate.

There is a UN website that helps you calculate damage and such. 

https://unsaferguard.org/un-saferguard/blast-damage-estimation

I am not sure what kind of explosive hamas/IJ typically uses in the rockets but ill just go with tnt 

Could this mean an errant Khaibar-1 could cause this kind of damage?

what a 150k kg explosion looks like https://www.youtube.com/shorts/bSz3x68qCCE

based on this it appears that it was a PIJ rocket that hit plus having so much fuel as it was supposed to fly to Haifa would add to the destructiveness"
"The dueling credible theories right now are between an airburst artillery munition  fired from Sderot, and some sort of fully fueled rocket that broke apart and hit the parking lot. There is also the suggestion that the rocket was intercepted not long after it was launched.

This report shows the state of the investigation, and why a lot of people are not believing the official story from either side:  


https://www.channel4.com/news/who-was-behind-the-gaza-hospital-blast-visual-investigation"
actually another group called Islamic Jihad is accused of being responsible for this bombing
"Yes, Hamas.

I'm also hoping civilians are safe. It would be immensely tragic, regardless of whose fault it is."
I mean the Palestine ambassador was very quick to accuse Israel and condemn them for the attack. What's not awesome news is that you have people willing to just make up deaths just to gain pity points.
"We can't really trust the government of Israel reporting on this, but we for sure cannot trust Hamas."
"The IDF pointed to Al-Jazeera video as proving their point.  Al-Jazeera did their own analysis of the video, along with video from other sources, and did not agree with the IDF's conclusion.

Im not saying this means that it was Israel that bombed the hospital, just that the evidence is a lot less clear."
"It's outrageous how quickly we believe anything from Israel as well. They can snipe reporters on video and the world is like ""welp IDF said not us so uhhh, no idea what happened there."" None of the powers that be here are worthy of any level of trust. I suppose we can trust the gov of Israel when they tell us that they're gonna do a lil ethnic cleansing though, cause that would be an incredibly dumb lie to tell the world."
"Naftali (israel spokesperson) literally tweeted about bombing the hospital, then DELETED the tweet, then blamed hamas.. 


[https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cyi13fmrzwv/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cyi13fmrzwv/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)"
"I watched the video that idf posted - it was quickly noted that it was time stamped almost an hour before the blast.

Idf took the video down immediately. The conversation between two Hamas members is also purported to be faked by linguist analysts.

That being said Hamas is clearly full of shit with a lot of their claims, it doesn't seem likely 500 people would be killed based on the blast.

Id be inclined to beleive idf over Hamas but it's a bad look to be caught lying once and presuming they made a fake voice call I'd almost say they have lost credibility. So both parties have no credibility.

In the end though, who really cares who did it. It's pretty clear both sides are going to kill lots of civilians before this is over."
"Uh, an Israeli spokesperson came out to claim the strike right after it happened and then retracted his statement after the world condemned it. Even if it was Hamas and an errant rocket, people aren’t suspecting Israel of the explosion for no reason - they literally said it was them first."
"Good thing we live in an age where no one can fake a picture/video. I’m not saying that’s what happened in this case but, unfortunately, pictures and videos don’t mean as much as they used to."
Didn’t an Israeli govt official tweet that they hit a hospital?
"> It's disappointing but not surprising how quickly the media took the outrageous Hamas claims seriously.

its only fair after the two days of news anchors in tears about decapitated babies."
"I mean, is it really a stretch to believe that a military force with a well established history of bombing hospitals might have bombed a hospital?

You reap what you sow..."
How dare anyone believe the IDF would bomb a hospital they already bombed recently.
"I never said no one died, just that there is definitely less than 500.

Current estimates by US and UK intelligence are saying 10-50 deaths with more injured.

There is also **very strong** evidence that it was a Hamas rocket misfiring."
After it came out that it was friendly fire all of a sudden palastine stated that ut was 250 people.  Odd...
"There's videos on the ground a few minutes after it happened, the ground outside is full of thorn and burned bodies everywhere, most of them look like kids."
Bro takes his news from tiktok
"There's hundreds of sources online.

Parking lot fire on the ground from a hamas rocket falling."
You think Hamas was counting people in parking lots before their rocket fell in it?
"Exactly, all it did was destroy some cars and make a parking lot fire."
Can people on this sub for one second stop talking about immigration on every post? Fuck sake.
"BTW we are looking at approving MAID for drug addicts now, isntead of you know... fixing society itself to the point people wouldnt need drugs to make life liveable."

This is channel 4's findings on it."
"I get the experts might know more than us,  but asking experts who haven't seen intelligence briefings doesn't seem like it's very beneficial."
He said “targeting a is unacceptable”. He didn’t say “Israel targeted the hospital”.  But pro-Israel folks decided that was what he meant because it fit their narrative.
"When two sides are at war, and you're condemning an attack on one side - It's pretty clear who you're condemning. 

If I said I condemn the attack on Israel, you wouldn't need me to clarify who I'm condemning, would you?"
"I agree that he didn’t specifically name Israel… but I think that’s a bit of a cop out, I think it was obviously implied; the message wasn’t lost on anyone."
The collective butthole of emotional reactionisim.

not how intelligence works between 5eyes
Thumbs up for useing bald faced lies properly.
"the majority of our intelligence comes from 5 eyes, which is considerably american intel"
"Or Canada doesn't immediately take America's word on everything...

Remember Iraq? Why we thinking it's a bad thing now? Cuz Trudeau?"
Americans are biased and not trustworthy when it comes to I/P conflict.
There is a video of the rocket coming out of gaza failing mid flight and falling on the hospital. The folks from r/combatfootage even geolocated it..

Well Satan does suck. What does your shirt say Hank? Satan rules?
The coincidence would be that a misfired rocket happened to fall on a hospital that Israel has demanded be evacuated just days earlier and had also been hit by two Israeli shells the previous Saturday injuring 4 people.
"He already did that when he condemned Isreal... for bombing the hospital...

Ultimately it doesn't matter but we should know that JT and JB ain't very close."
"Why though?  
And I'm asking honestly here. Even if you don't believe the US or Israel, since they've been known to lie and even fabricate evidence. Why believe Hamas here? 

I would understand if anything from the original report was deemed true. But it appears none of it was, not even remotely. And Hamas is showing zero evidence to support their claim. So even if you think Israel might be lying here, based on what, other than past behavior?   
(And mind you, it's not that the other party here is some truth beacon either. Probably much worse if you really check their record. - I mean, I just saw a video of Hamas spokeperson saying they didn't kidnap any civilians and they didn't brutally murder any either). 

Please explain, I would love to hear an answer, and what evidence makes you think it might still be Israel who dropped the bomb."
I think we are saying rhe same thing. I was too emotional when pounding at the keyboard. But I was saying its Bullshit that Canada is dragging its feet and listening to Terrorists and not our allies. Even after all the evidence
">The fact that this is a hot take is what's wrong with this whole mess.

The issue isn't that it's a hot take (it's not), it's what that actually looks like that's unclear. ""I wish we could just have world peace"" sounds all well and good until one party decides they want to invade another. Acting like we can just snap our fingers and war will disappear is naive at best."
"It would help if more of the world realized that Hamas are the one killing both Israelis and Palestinians. It would help if the number one priority, not specifically now but in general, would have been to remove them from Gaza and anywhere else like we did with ISIS. Hamas is not fighting for Palestinian freedom or Palestinian anything. No one benefits more from dead Gazans than Hamas."
"These people don't realize one side has in its charter the extermination of all Jews. There is no ""no more killing"" check box odor them."
"Yeah, kinda lucky Britain didn't take that position when the rest of Europe had collaborated or surrendered in WW2."
This seems way more grey than WW2 or even the Ukraine/Russia conflict.
Now is it the Palestinians or the Israelis that are fighting to prevent the other from taking over the world? Stopping the holocaust in the process.
Switzerland made out pretty good. They’re the most secure nation in Europe. Seems to me they made the right decision
Ireland or the UK?
Were the German people exterminated after WWII because the Nazis were German?
I'd argue there's actually two.
The people doing the killing?  Dropping bombs on civilian targets isn’t okay.  Explain to me how collective punishment is a viable response?
"No, you’re right Israel should keep bombing and killing civilians and then act all surprised when those kids grow up to be radicalized.  This is a circle of violence and what’s happening now will only make that cycle continue."
"You mean when the Israeli’s stole the Palestinian’s homeland?  Yeah, I’d be pissed too."
"The Palestinians in Gaza live in an open air prison camp governed by the Israelis.  What those Hamas idiots did absolutely should be condemned and they should be captured and put on trial.  That doesn’t give the IDF the right to bomb the entire city.

There’s absolutely a third choice.  Don’t need to align with any of the violent aggressors.  Come up with a fair two state solution. If you have all of the land why would want to give any of it up?"
"What happened?  Israel terrorized the Palestinians in Gaza for years.  Hamas launches a terrorist attack, Israel responds by bombing the heck out of Gaza creating a new generation of Palestinian terrorists and the cycle repeats.

Explain to me what was different this time except more deaths in the Israeli side during the initial attack?  We’ve seen this play out every few years and repeating the same actions on both sides isn’t going to produce a better outcome."
Why not relocate the Israelis since they came after?
"The evidence that we the public have seen is not conclusive. What the Americans and Israelis have is a whole other story, and I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't disclose a majority of it.

This is a good move by our government. If they can't confirm it themselves, they should not say anything beyond a generic statement of support for the civilian casualties."
"Same here. I would actually be horrified and terrified by Israel if it somehow turns out to be them. 
And I probably wouldn't trust anything they say for a long long time. 

But my god people, the comments here make me worried about humanity. This has passed conspiracy theory territory 2 days ago - This is ""Vaccines kill people"" and ""Earth is Flat"" levels already with people's arguments. 
Which, yes - that could also MAYBE be true, the same exact eay that Israel might be behind this. But at this point, nothing will make people think it wasn't Israel, and the tinniest detail will get them to say it was."
"This is a loose loose... if Israeli did it, you'll never be convinced. If a failed Hamas rocket was to blame, you'll use it as convincing evidence to wipe out more Palestinians. Either way, Palestinians die because you're upset that... Palestinians were killed... 

I completely agree waiting for evidence, and if it was a failed rocket, I believe Palestinians are backed into a corner here."
"There’s no real proof on either side, that isn’t massively biased (i.e.: Hamas claims vs Israel military intelligence statements). Initial ‘proof’ provided by Israel was a video of the event with a time stamp that didn’t match (so, not real), and Hamas ‘proof’ is equally cherry picked.

Neither side wants to own this obviously. Waiting and seeing more evidence (or lack therefor) is prudent thing to do. Something else bad will happen in the interim by both sides."
"What more evidence do you need that Israel is committing war crimes that shutting off water and food to an entire population?

And some say well - why does Israel even need to give water to Palestinians. it's doing them a favor...NO....Israel has always used the control of water to punish Palestinians..."
"Ehhh… I believe Israel’s story is probably correct, but saying the evidence is conclusive isn’t really true. The call between the terrorists where they talked about the hospital being hit would be very easy to fake. The imagery of trajectory of rockets is relatively easy to fake, especially when you don’t get the first hand information but are getting electronic info second hand. The video of the explosion from an Israeli drone that was taken down because the time stamps didn’t match is sketchy as fuck. The only piece of evidence that really supports Israeli’s claims is that there’s a video of a rocket exploding in mid-air that’s purportedly the same time. 

Now, was the explosion an Israeli air strike? Certainly not based on the lack of large crater. However it could have been a mortar or an artillery shell. 

The best evidence for why it wasn’t Israel is actually the logic test. What’s the risk to Israel if they were to have been responsible for the attack and were caught lying about it? HUGE! What’s the risk to Hamas if they lie about it? Almost none because Hamas is not an organization with a track record of telling the truth and if they’re caught lying it’s just another “eh, they lied who cares”. But, what’s the benefit to Hamas in convincing people that Israel was responsible? HUGE. 

Honestly the best explanation of this can be found here. I highly recommend people take a look: https://youtu.be/l29IRT16zq0?si=fJh1NWKmBimsiYF9"
"What do you deem reliable? OSINT groups did their own investigations and came to the same conclusion. 
And you can do the same. Don't look at Israeli evidence, look at just independent and even opposite biased evidence. I did, and I still came to the same conclusion. 

I'm not believing it 100%, I believe it beyond reasonable doubt. There is never 100%. In anything. Am i 100% certain Trudeau isn't a lizard person? No, but I'm certain enough. 
And I really doubt you'd use the same arguments if it was reversed and evidence pointed at Israel's airstrike doing the damage. You wouldn't wait for eztrrnal verification. Cause you know what? The world already did, they immediately chose to believe Israel did it, without any verification at all."
"Targeting and slaughtering 1,400 civilians, raping women next to the corpses of their friends, killing children, burning bodies, kidnapping 200 civilians and parading beaten women naked through an angry mob...that's NOT part of a fucking conflict. That's a religious terrorist group who calls for the killing of every jew and ""no negotiations, only Jihad"" in their public charter. It's literally their only goal. And they do this knowing full well that it will get thousands of its own citizens killed in the process without anything good coming out of it, except the death of those jews. 

Lets be clear - this isn't about Israel vs Palestinians. This is about Israel rooting out a psychotic murderous terrorist faction for the good of ALL citizens."
"No, it started in 1948 when Arabs including what are now Palestinians refused the original settlement between Jewish and Arab people in Mandate Palestine and tried to genocide the Jews. Then they lost again and again, refusing any peace, while whining to the world that the mean, evil Jews won't let them genocide in peace."
"Because 1500 Palestinian children dead in one week apparently don't matter as much. /s

Attacks against civilians is wrong and characteristic of terrorism. There are NO justifications for it. If anyone is using revenge/response/retaliation to Oct 7 to justify Israel's carnage of the past week then they are simultaneously justifying Oct 7 for the hundreds of dead Palestinians by the hands of Israel over the past year alone..."
"Well, you are not talking to me certainly. It doesn't have to be an all or nothing. Most people living in Gaza and Israel have very little to do with the tragedy that has been unfolding before us. How much killing and displacement of innocents is justified in the pursuit of justice and safety?  If the answer to this question is ""as much as it takes"", then genocide is on the table, which I hope we can agree upon is immoral.   


If you are not this hardline though, then why do you need to stand firmly behind one of the parties? Criticize them when they make mistakes and support them when they make wise decisions.  Moral questions in real life are almost always more complex than a binary."
When did Israel behead children?
The militants recorded it all on their smartphones which subsequently got recovered from their bodies.
Haha give it to him. They’re in full force in r/canada
Oh? 1200 Israeli citizens weren't slaughtered at music festivals and in their homes? Disgusting that you're trying to whitewash a literal terrorist organization. The world will be a better place when Hamas no longer exists.

86% of Arab Israelis are supportive of eradicating Hamas. It is not a Palestine vs. Israel thing, they see it as a war on terror. Here 5000 KM away we say Apartheid and Genocide.

" No, this was a terrorist attack."
"Nope, Hamas has been firing rockets ever since they could, which is when Israel, as part of a peace offering, removed all Jews from Gaza and gave Palestinians full autonomy. They elected Hamas who have fired rockets ever since, going back to around 2006, basically daily. Those rockets are fired at civilians and you probably said nothing that entire time. 

So I know what is happening, but let's see how you spin and defend terrorists."
Glad to help
"I also want to go out to space to see that the Earth is indeed round with my own eyes to 100% believe it. But even without it, with all the pictures, videos, statements and logic pointing to it really being round and no evidence so far to it being flat - I am confident enough to support the claim that it's round without seeing it myself."
"> We contacted 20 think tanks, universities and companies with weapons expertise. Nine of them are yet to respond, five would not comment, but we spoke to experts at the remaining six.
>We asked whether the available evidence - including the size of the explosion and the sounds heard beforehand - could be used to determine the cause of the hospital blast.
>So far, the findings are inconclusive. Three experts we spoke to say it is not consistent with what you would expect from a typical Israeli air strike with a large munition.

I don’t think your summary of this is accurate.

The BBC has spoken to 11 experts. 5 refused to comment at all but there could be a number of reasons for this, particularly when you consider that anything they say could lead to backlash. These experts may have strong views about what happened but are too scared to share them.

Of the 6 that were willing to comment, 3 said the evidence is not consistent with an Israeli air strike. The remaining 3 didn’t provide a view either way.

"There are other outlets like Channel 4 that did not completely bungle their reporting like BBC did. 

BBC’s poor reporting around this has soured me on them completely."
i mean most people don't want to wade through the massive amount of misinformation on the topic. been like a day? maybe realize that you don't need to find out about war crimes as they're happening.
">Guaranteed this guy hates Israel

Are you talking about me? If so, your statement is false.

>he thinks that by saying “I want to wait for the facts to come out,” not only does he feel like he’s superior to everyone

It's not about being superior. I believe in procedural justice, how exactly is that a problem for you?

>but he will also continue to believe that Israel was responsible

If you mean me, from what I've seen on several media channels, it appears very plausible that Islamic Jihad is behind this.

I just don't think political leaders should jump to conclusions, make accusations, or assign political blame about war crimes. That's not their role. It's judges who convict people for crimes, not politicians."
"I can provide a possible explanation for the video that was removed.

In the scenario where Israel did not do it, they would be immediately scrambling for evidence to exonerate themselves.

They receive information that the blast was caused by a malfunctioning rocket. They look for evidence of a rocket malfunctioning around the time of the blast.

They find a video from around the time of the blast showing just that and share it because they believe it exonerates them. 

It turns out that the video is timestamped to shortly after the blast was reported, so they remove the video as it does not show what they thought it did.

They then find a video from Al-Jazeera timestamped to the exact time of the blast and geolocated to the location of the hospital. This video shows a rocket malfunctioning shortly before a blast is seen near the hospital. They share this video as it is what they were looking for from the beginning."
"Nothing dropped by an israeli plane would really create an explosion/fire like what the day after videos showed. Any bomb would have cratered the ground and showered the buildings with fragments, destroying all windows, cars, and solar panels. How a misfired rocket could have caused the damage is certainly something that needs to be investigated, but from the visible damage there is absolutely no way that 500 people would have been killed"
"I trust the US more than a literal terrorist cell, especially as we now have photos and videos proving that not only was it not an Israeli missile, it didn't even hit the hospital. A Hamas rocket hit a parking lot."
"🙄 yes, I think it makes more sense to trust the US intelligence agencies, whose statements corroborate those of OSINT investigations, more than Hamas. 

Whose version do you trust the most?"
If you can't there are sources you can check yourself.
"Naftali is a social media influencer who has worked for Netanyahu, but he’s not listed as an official representative of Israel. https://www.politifact.com/article/2023/oct/19/explaining-a-deleted-x-post-that-said-israel-is-re/"
"Israel is the one who flip-flopped on who was responsible. The US said from the beginning that it was likely a bullet from the IDF (https://www.state.gov/on-the-killing-of-shireen-abu-akleh/). 
  
The only thing that changed was the US wanting to conduct its own criminal investigation. The US position itself was consistent, and that was just based on looking at the investigations submitted from both sides; they didn’t have access to their own information in that case."
"They didn’t lie about Shireen Abu Akleh even though Israel did, and the US didn’t even have its own intelligence in that case. 
  
Allyship only matters in politics, not intelligence. They might withhold intelligence to protect an ally, but when the US releases intelligence there’s no reason to doubt its validity on its face. That’s why they were releasing intelligence about Russia before it invaded Ukraine as a deterrent. They have no reason to undermine the integrity of their own intelligence operations."
I don't think you could describe that as an attack on the hospital.
"People said 'wow, this sucks all around' and were condemned for not picking a side by stupid people."
That has nothing to do with my post

"No which is why I think Israel is just as abhorrent. Babies killed by Israeli bombs and babies killed by Hamas however they did it, are equally shitty crimes to me. At that point if I really wanna start comparisons then I'll do it with the numbers but I have a feeling I already know who has more baby kills under their belt"
"6000 bombs dropped on Gaza vs. 1 highly disputed self-inflicted event

Directly on a hospital though? There is a whole lot of Gaza it could've landed on

This isn’t a case of good vs bad"
Yeah we should just find the side that killed less kids and side with them!
"Did you ever wonder how the simple rockets that Hamas uses are powerfulful enough to destroy a hospital??

>I doubt Israel’s rockets would fail to hit the target

That's kind of the point

They are.

Oh wait, no one cares about the lives of human animals right?"
Yes. See also Shireen Abu Akleh
"A lot of people have simply not paid attention to this over the last 20+ years, and so are shockingly susceptible to what the rest of us know to be the go-to playbook when the IDF does too big an oopsie. It's depressing but it's not surprising at all."
The UN already said it was impossible and the Israelis shelled the people leaving anyways
Yeah Hamas bombs that can barely take out a parked car somehow caused under 500 deaths.

Great. Now we are denying that a hospital even was bombed.
"Errant missile strike, possible other kind of munition, don't care.  It's old news now.

What *has* been bombed is a 1600 year old church compound sheltering refugees...and other sites in the south even though people were told to go south for ""safety"".

Point is, if you're going to play the game of defending ""one side', you're going to loose in the end.  Look at the outcomes, that's all that matters."

I'm asking for a source of Canadian Officials officially blaming Israel
Who TF are these accounts? Why would you believe this knowing there's a ton of disinfo out there?
"I'm sorry, where does that show Canadian representatives blaming Israel?"
Bombing a hospital IS unacceptable
Did you actually read the article? Please quote exactly where Justin said Israel is responsible.
"Good try, better luck next time"
Learn to read
">There are very few people trying to pretend that Hamas is made up of good people.

And yet, for some strange reason people (both politicians and the public, and even news) seem to believe everything Hamas says. Take this bombing, for example. The only source for info was Hamas (because journalists can't really go there), and they all ran with that. Similarly with the water pipes into rockets story - it's obvious bullshit meant to cover the true source of the rockets, but everybody just accepts it. Why?"
"Okay, but Palestinian terrorist organizations existed in the Gaza Strip before it ever fell under Israeli hands... Egypt literally GAVE it to Israel because it was nothing but a terrorism hotbed they wanted nothing to do with anymore, and regularly close the border crossings because virtually ALL suicide bombings in Egypt are caused by Palestinians from the Strip, so painting it as though Israel is the cause of it, is simply flat out untrue and shows a grotesque lack of historical knowledge"
"to quote you

>""the apartheid inflicted on Palestine by Isreal""

This supposed apartheid is the same apartheid Canada inflicts on the US.

* Does Canada allow US citizens to cross the border without stopping at a checkpoint and having their passport checked?
* Does Canada provide free water and electricity to the US?
* Does Canada require a US citizen to have a work permit to work in Canada?

What is the justification for treating non-citizens this way? A non-citizen of an ally country. I would like to think Canada would be a little more discriminating of someone trying to enter from a country that calls for Canada's annihilation."
Are you saying Hamas isn’t a terrorist organization?
"No propaganda. Hamas is recognized as terrorist organization in many countries, Canada included."
Hamas is a literally a terrorist organization though
"I mean... I'm pretty sure in this case, considering Hamas is literally a designated terrorist organization and has been for like twenty years at this point, the designation of ""terrorists"" isn't unwarranted."

"Israel: Our intelligence agency was hit by surprise, we didn't see this massive surprise attack from Hamas coming.

Also Israel: Here's a recording of two Hamas operatives saying that it was a missile that hit the hospital (ignore that it's the wrong dialect and accent).

"You are probably correct.  But this video has passed through some very suspect hands and if you think the US, UK ext. are above manipulating it to suit their goals you are naive."
And?
And most Americans news and IDF says “trust me bro” are credible ?
What source is NOT biased? I’d love to hear it
"At this point, every 'sources' you'll get are biased. I've seen videos from palestinians and analysis from Israelis. Hard to believe either."
I said that because everyone thinks being critical of one side means you automatically buy into the other side's story.
"None of the footage lines up or corroborates what the IDF have, said. Coupled with the fact that they 100% faked the audio..."
oh yeah definitely so your saying if the US found evidence of Israel war crimes they would actually admit it to the world? not a chance they would admit it.
"if out of 50 (example) different countries reporting. Only Israel and USA+allies are saying it’s Hamas. And another 40 others are saying it’s unconfirmed, but likely Isreal. All while they present different evidence or reasoning. Doesn’t that make you doubt?"
"So the best you got a is:

"Was he expected to describe the bombing of a hospital without the word ""bombing""?"
"So no, he didn't blame Israel.  You're playing gymnastics with syntax.  Bombing does not imply it was Israel.

Yand you can absolutly point out war crimes done by none government groups, we did it with Isis. 

He *might* have thought it was Israel, his language may even show a bias in terminology based on that belief, but that is not the daming thing as blaming Israel for the attack."

"Hamas rocket accuracy is abysmal. Something like 20% of Hamas rockets land right back in Gaza.

"Yep. Agree 100%. 

I dropped a shit ton of JDAM in my day. Even a 500 pounder, properly fuzed, going high order would've created FAR more damage than this—and it would’ve been a very, very different damage pattern.

This simply was not the result of a first world warhead or bomb body going high order. No way, no how."
You have done your homework! Solid.
Ya no shit.  The trees were still standing.  A JDAM would have taken down palm trees at the very least.
Iron dome doesn’t intercept middles at that stage of flight

"We can‘t trust literally anyone until the war is over and the whole situation can be followed up on by independent journalists and historians, and even then they will be accused of having an agenda"
Al Jazeera is funded by Qatar govt.
"AJ's ""analysis"" claims it was an iron dome interception which downed it and caused the damage, which is technically impossible. 1. You don't see any iron dome launches in the videos they show, where you can see the interceptor as a bright dot usually and 2, iron dome does not intercept rockets over Gaza that soon after launch and could not have flown there in that time because they aren't hypersonic.

Their ""analysis"" video is bunk."
Al Jazeera is a spokesperson of Muslim world. It will never side with Israel
"What's irrefutable is that Hamas lied in their release minutes after the explosion. The hospital wasn't destroyed and 500 people didn't die.  They also announced they were launching a new type of rocket minutes before the barrage.

No evidence exists that's its an IDF rocket.  It's certainly possible but unlikely."
"Some of the so called evidence…would not make it through grade 3 debate class scrutiny.

But it’s the truth now."
"Just keep in mind that Al Jazeera's run by the same government currently sheltering Hamas' leaders and that also literally funded the creation of ISIS.

They're not a reputable media outlet, and if you watch their arabic broadcasts they don't even pretend to hide their genocidal intent and racism most of the time."

"Naftali is just some ""influencer"" who previously did some social media work for Bibi. He is in absolutely no official capacity a spokesperson for Israel. He tweeted an idiotic assumption and then deleted it. *Please* don't take this as an official statement from the government or the IDF.

I'm not claiming to have any idea what happened to the hospital."
"They struck a different ""hospital"" with no one in it (to the North).

Palestinians aren't dumb, they know which spots are run by Hamas. They didn't go in it."
"There is no footage of a destroyed hospital, no indication at all that it's Israeli ordinance like JDAM.

Multiple neutral news sources have the pictures of the damaged parking lot with about a dozen cars damaged/burned out.

So with all the evidence that's out it's not looking like IDF."
They did briefly during the fog of war but it was removed once more information came to light. Multiple videos from multiple sources that I trust shows it was a rocket that fell short. That also aligns with the photographic evidence of the damage to the vehicles in the parking lot.
"That's a fair point. Lots of Israeli bodies were mutilated as per photographic evidence, exactly how many were decapitated and how many were infants is up for debate."
"Yeah there was definitely not 40 babies that were decapitated. Only a *small number* of the 40 dead babies were decapitated.

Propaganda these days =\\"
"That ‘evidence’ is provided by those accused of doing it though, and it’s cherry picked. 

Yes, it’s possible but you have to be objective. This is the same source who claimed 40 decapitated babies, had the US President repeat it as fact, and ultimately meant something different (albeit still bad by the way!).

Point is fog of war, nobody really knows for certain what’s going on as no way a neutral 3rd party can report, so being objective is not a bad thing."
">Current estimates by US and UK intelligence are saying 10-50 deaths with more injured.

Who don't have any actual way of knowing. And Doctors without borders has been reporting literally thousands of people sleeping on the grounds of the main hospital in Gaza. So the 470s estimate seems reasonable and the US/Isreali/UK report seem designed fo down play the incident.

>There is also very strong evidence that it was a Hamas rocket misfiring.

I wouldn't call it strong. There is a single video and Israels radar report. The video Isreal put out has the wrong time stamp. The audio recording is in the wrong dialect. 

With regard to the limited damage/crater that same hospital is reported by MSF to have been hit 4 days earlier. So whatever explosive they are using are clearly not always creating massive craters."
"We still don't know it was ""friendly fire"", that is what Israel and the US are saying. That's like believing Hamas and Iran. 

From what I've seen the 150-200 dead isnt a report of from the Palestine health authority but the chief medical officer at Shia hospital and that would just account for the people taken too that hospital.  Would you be able to point me too the 250 dead article?"

Bahahaha what the hell is this? Go away.
"Yes Hamas report of 500 dead in 80 bed hospital, with just pictures of a parking lot on fire. Solid evidence!"

Amazing how people like you completely misquote the guy.

When did he condemn Israel? I thought his statement was pretty neutral and a good hedge for either possible outcome (Israel did it or Hamas did it).

"Please. Live in the real world. 

1. War is brutal.  Look at world war 2. Were all Germans bad? No. But plenty had to get firebombed to end the war. 

2. There isn’t a third choice. Hamas won’t stop until Israel is gone. And I’d say judging by the piece of shit people all over the world, there are plenty of Muslims who won’t stop until Israel is gone. Hard to negotiate when people want you wiped off the face of the earth."

Except PM fuck face already blamed Israel for it when all the “evidence” he had was from Hamas mouthpieces. He could at least apologize for that.
Does Israel’s track record mean nothing to you? Israel has done worse than this countless times before. Is it really that hard to believe they would do something they have done multiple times before?
What should be asked is why Hamas would launch rockets near citizens. Each and every death is the fault of Hamas.
"I would go to every single comment I wrote about this and say "" I was wrong guys. When you're wrong you're wrong and I jumped the gun. Sorry I blamed the terrorist organization for this.""

That wont ever happen because.....The evidence is already more than substantial if you don't have an anti-Israel bias. Even Al Jazeera moved the goal post to an Iron dome interception and not an attack anymore. 

This is like getting pictures from NASA(US in this case) + seeing the horizon and still saying the earth may still be flat.  Don't jump to conclusions."

"Hey hey hey, slow down there.

Wasn't the whole barbaric attack war crimes? The thousands of missiles a day? The restaurant shootings? etc etc etc

Throwing stones from a glass house.

Israel shut down the water as a means of coaxing the representatives of the people in Gaza (Hamas) to return the hostages. If they cared about Gazans more than they hate Israel, maybe it could have worked. Did Hamas secure water for their citizens before they attacked?

 If they knew Israel turns off the water they should have, no? They use their citizens as shields and will do so over and over until destroyed."
"The moon landing could also be fake. What's the point here? Everything can be fake. 

There is zero evidence pointing to Israel other than a statement by Hamas made at the start of it, which everything else about the statement turned out to be false. 
There is nothing tying Israel to this other than our bias (bias as in we think it's them because we think it's possible for them to do something like this)."
A faction they supported and put in power in the first place
"It actually goes back to 1917. The British Empire, mostly a Rothschild, wanted Jewish support for WW1 thus the Balfour Declaration was initiated which gave Jews “back their homeland in Palenstine,” but at the time was an Ottoman territory. So what it means is the British took and gave away something that didn’t long to them. In 1948, Israel declared itself an official nation, no longer just existing on paper. The area created for them was no longer enough. They kept pushing the boundaries and claiming more land. Now the whole place is Israel and there’s no place for the Palestinians. Moral of the story is do not give away something that doesn’t belong to you. Also, free Palestine! Also, fuck the Rothschild family, they still fucking shit up today, too."
"Have you seen some of what has happened to children over the past week? Does proximity make a difference to the impact?

Haven't the IDF already retracted that beheaded children claim?"
Get up to speed. I'm speaking of the beheaded babies that's been debunked.
it's crazy how much more nuanced the debate is among actual Israelis versus how one sided this Canadian sub is
I've seen your comments. You're quite good at sophisms.
"Hamas doesn’t exist in the West Bank, and Israel still oppresses the Palestinians there, illegally occupies their lands, kills their children, and kicks them out of their homes and gives it to Israelis to settle there. Don’t pretend like the Israel-Palestinian conflict started on the 7th of October. If you really care about killing of children and women, don’t just look at Hamas, Israel has a lot of explaining to do."
"""yes we already carpet bombed a densely populated civilian area ful of children, yes we bombed an escape path we told civilians to leave on, but we would never blow up a hospital! We have morals we only kill thousands of healthy children! We gave Gaza fancy restaurants, malls and beaches."""
"Gazans are refugees of Israel it’s not Egypt’s obligation to take them and even if it did it would not resolve that they are refugees of Israel and fully have the right to live on their ancestral lands. 

It’s an open air prison because Israel as a government that Gazans cannot vote for and a government that is not accountable to gazans  controls its borders, trade, water, power, and general living conditions and people are unable to leave.  

If Gazans were Jews you’d be singing a different tune."
"Israel cut off drinking water to 2.2 million people, 900 000 of them literal children. You can denounce Hamas and what they did while also being critical of how Israel is handling Gaza and the innocent civilians trapped in the wake of the attack."
"Egypt is pressured by Israel to close their crossing. Do you think Israel will allow Egypt to have open borders with Gaza?

Eradication of Hamas will not change things in Gaza or the occupied territories. The root of the issue is the occupation and apartheid, which existed and will continue to exist before Hamas and the Hamas attacks, as it is driven by right wing religious Jewish settlers and the right wing Israeli government that has power mainly due to their support."
The person you replied to literally never mentioned genocide...
"Also their land is shrinking, their food, water and basic needs are rationed. 60% unemployed. >50% children because the older generations get killed. This is genocide from day 1. Taking about Gaza specifically.
Stop revising history. Hasbra militants in full force on western subs is just sad, but also hilarious."
"😏 just say it, just call the Arabs a bad name, I know you feel like it. It's guttural for you. Just say it my guy. It'll be our little secret."
"And what do you call Israel's response? A reserved response, or the classic, ""fuck around and find out""?

Do those poor children deserve to be starved and denied water, medicine, etc...? No. 

Listen, if Israel wants to hunt down Hamas militants and recruiters, I'm all for that. But, they can eliminate EVERY Hamas member today, but unless they change the way they treat Palestine, shit like this is going to happen again. 

THAT is the reality.  Israel has ABSOLUTE zero intention of handing back stolen land. They have zero intention of making Palestinian whole. And as long as they continue acting like assholes, they'll be subject to terrorist attacks.  

This is not an endorsement.  

What did England have to do to end terror campaigns in Belfast and Derry, and to a lesser extent, London? 

They had to make concessions.  When they made those concessions, groups like Sinn Fein, P-IRA, Ulster Liberation, etc...became irrelevant. Sinn Fein was able to transition to a political party.  Liberation groups ended up getting involved with other criminal activities.  But, the terrorist attacks ceased. 

The Palestinians NEED representation.  They need their voices heard. While the world wags its fingers at Israel, NOTHING is going to change. Put BiBi in prison for war crimes, and embargo Israel until the ILLEGAL settlers hand over STOLEN land, and I guarantee you that the rhetoric from Palestinians, as a whole, will turn down.  

That's how this problem gets smaller. But, hey, Israel is a democracy (even though it's a Jewish ethnostate that has shifted further right akin to the US under Trump). 

The bullied kid punched a bully in the dick, and now everyone is saying the bullied kid was wrong for choosing violence when the bullied kid already exhausted every other legal avenue. 

To quote MLK ""a riot is a voice of the unheard."""
"This is an extremely charitable interpretation IMO - when you are trying to confirm I feel like one of the first steps is checking timestamps no?

It does not explain the ""call"" between two hamas ""leaders"" talking about the oopsie they did.


Either way - when there are any question marks for something this massive we should express a degree of skepticism."
"the us is on israels side, they are allies. ofc they are going to be bias towards israel."
"Hamas isn't the only one blaming Israel though, this is not a rumor, there's video footage that questions Israeli claims, look up Channel 4's video on it, or Al Jazeera's, depsite of the Hospital bombing Israel is still commiting war crimes."
Lol you think the US isn't a terrorist? Remember what that country did to the Native Americans? They're not all that good either...
"Its a good question, if the US has so much invested in Israel how do we know for sure their statements are true 100% of the time."

"""Hamas attacked itself in its confusion"""
"Well maybe Trudeau experiences attacks differently, who knows."
You're reaching unreasonably far to grasp something that isn't there. The truth is the PM has not been anti-Israeli his response since October 7.
The IDF being repeated proven liars kinda does have something to do with it.
"You mean the hospital parking lot that one of Hamas or Islamic Jihad inadvertently exploded a failed rocket in as part of their ongoing efforts to kill as many Jews as possible? 

I don’t really see any equivalence there. If anything it is an abject lesson demonstrating they are just as terrible to their own people as they are to Jews."
"It’s not a leap of logic that reputable news organizations initially believed the IDF bombed the hospital — they’d been saying they would. 

The Baptist hospital that got bombed had already been hit by 2 missiles by the IDF. The IDF even called the director telling him to evacuate the hospital (they couldn’t bec some patients cannot be moved).

Now since Israel says they didn’t, I’ll hold off before making my mind up."
No.
Suggest a way to eliminate Hamas that doesn't involve civilian casualties.
"Yeah, Israel"
"Looks like you completely forgot about the 3000+ rockets fired from Gaza by Hamas and Islamic Jihad. I mean, you really have no idea do you?"
[removed]
But it didn’t fall directly on a hospital.  It landed on a parking lot next to the hospital.  Why would Israel bomb a parking lot?
Seems more likely given Hamas has provided no evidence or allowed impartial representatives to investigate.
I'm thinking we should side with the one's who don't chant death to america seeing as how that is us.
"That would be Hamas.

Israel’s killed more kids in 10 days than Russia has killed in 2 years in Ukraine."
Do you still think the hospital got destroyed? If so you are so horribly misinformed and behind on this subject that you shouldn’t even be commenting.
"Actually aside from watching 3 videos from different angles taken from what I’m sure was the Gaza Strip I can confidently say I believe the IDF and the US in this instance. Especially after seeing footage of the crudely made water pipe rockets. I mean stack any western backed nations munitions out vs some junk made in some back yard and of course it’s going to have a significantly better chance of hitting it’s target rather than exploding mid flight and dropping in a hospitals parking lot. I would always trust the intelligence of The US over that of a terrorist organization any day. But let’s even take that out of the picture, what would the IDF have to gain? They basically had world support because Hamas strictly targeted civilian populations with a surprise attack. Why would they ruin having a moral high ground for taking out a hospital? I’m not excusing the stuff Israel has done in the past on the regular, I’m just saying my opinion that there is damning evidence Hamas would spin Islamic Jihad’s failure into Israel bombing a hospital for there own gain."
"right, because a gazan (probably Hamass) stringer reported this.  Let's examine this paragraph for a moment of this supposed attack in a safe zone.

>A residential building in Khan Younis, a city in southern Gaza where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had sought shelter, was among the places hit. Medical personnel at Nasser Hospital said they received at least 12 dead and 40 wounded.

so there is a building with thousands of people in it. So at least 2000. Israel destroys the building, yet only 12 dead.    A building collpasing from a missile strike, and almost no dead. Sure. that sounds likely.

about as likely as the hospital israel bombed.  or the church.

you should be more skeptical of any claims that come from a terrorist organization. a few days ago HamAss falsely claimed Israel destroyed a church.

These are nothing but false press releases from HamAss the news agencies eat up. 

HamAss also claims, There were also no Israeli civilians massacred by HamAss last week."
"not ignoring them, it is not the point. I was responding to the point of Israel being falsely accused of systematically destroying gaza. 

If you are really concerned about innocent palestinians being killed and not just looking for an opportunity to attack Israel, you would /will protest Hamas using people as human shields, and turning civilian residences and infrastructure (including hospitals, UN schools, mosques) into valid military targets (according to the geneva conventions) as hamas places their  weapon factories, munition dumps, terrorist headquarters in these locations. You would/will protest Hamas using their populace as human shields

I assume you have protested HamAss hitting an Israeli hospital with rockets, twice already in this war, just as vociferously."
">Oh wait, no one cares about the lives of human animals right?

Do you care about lives of those particular civilians who celebrated Hamas attack on 7th and 8th October? Those who slapped and spitted on those who were kidnapped by Hamas (btw, they are still kept in captivity)"
"In this case though it's quite clear Hamas lied and that you're falling for Hamas propaganda. Was incredible how minutes after the explosion they knew the exact amount of casualties, and reports are they're nowhere near 500. Nor was the hospital leveled."
"Israel has not shelled people leaving, that was more Hamas propaganda."
"Maybe that's because it didn't cause 500 deaths... Look at the pictures ffs

https://twitter.com/spectatorindex/status/1715044121268932960"
">Hamas bombs that can barely take out a parked car

This might not be the argument that you think it is."
Or maybe just maybe it did not kill 500. I mean they had a body count in what like 10 minutes after the attack
"Yeah, I suspected. That isn't an official, that is some asshole social media ""influencer"". It also isn't clear that the original Tweet even existed."
"I know full well what they are referencing, the main point in dispute is the ""official"" part of it."
"96% of deaths since 2005 are Palestinian, it's pretty fucking obvious who the oppressor and aggressor is. My lord you literally have Ukraine happening but some how manage to side with the Russian equivalent in this conflict. Not to mention the fact that Israel themselves support Hamas as a means of further destabilizing the region as admitted by them.  Why do they attack the west bank then? Hamas isn't even there.

Hamas doesn't even have JDAM capability, they have the capability to do this to a hospital with a rocket but have never managed to do that much damage in a single blow to Israel?"
"Geoconfirmed is a group of analysts, some including former war crimes investigators who work with Bellingcat, an independent, award winning fact checking organization. They have a very good reputation. Been following them since the Ukraine war and they do very good work."
huh.  of course.  what are you going on about?  it was not bombed.
lol.  wow.  i suppose the bombing was done by the sweds.  that is what he meant.  the disingenuous takes on this war is drawing out the most argumentative and irrational people.  /facepalm
what do you want.  him to call out what type of plane he thought dropped the bomb on the hospital?  some very dense people just being argumentative
"apartheid has existed in gaza before hamas took over, and apartheid continues to exist in the west bank. Israel controls the occupied terrorories, and implements blockages and apartheid."

"Maybe they are but I think trusting those people is less naive than trusting Hamas. 

Also there are quite a few videos at this point"
Most American media jumped on this saying it was Israel lol
APNews is generally pretty solid in my experience.
"So Al Jazeera is fake news? I can believe that

Well you can believe that they faked the audio, I believe they have really crappy rockets that blow up their own citizens."
"Doubt what I've seen on Al Jazeera's live broadcast? Not likely, that's the funny part. 

I'm pretty certain that the ""other countries"" are making a calculated decision as to minimize unrest Jihadist unrest in their own countries, apart from the ones who sponsor and condone it of course. I'm pretty sure those had their mind made up before anything ever even happened..."

We had leopard 1s but they were used as target practice when we got the leopard 2s. Canadas reluctance to giving Ukrainians some leopard 2s was due to the fact that most had been rotting away in storage after being used in Afghanistan. The government tried to pretend it wasn’t sending them because it didn’t want the conflict to escalate

What hospitals?
But the 300lbs of tannerite video just doesn't line up with the massive explosion and fireball. Unless the fuel is more explosive than the actual payload
Nor does it intercept them in Gaza within 15 seconds of launch since the interceptors cannot travel at light speed
"Ah, but have you considered Jewish space lasers?"
"The IDF is funded by Israel and the US, do you see where we are going with this..."
And the IDF is a spokesperson for Israel. So what we need is a more neutral third party
">What's irrefutable is that Hamas lied in their release minutes after the explosion.


""A video posted by the official State of Israel’s account on social media platform X on Tuesday night was also presented as evidence that the hospital was struck in outgoing rocket fire from militants. But the timestamp on the video appeared not to match up with the time that the explosion took place, and the tweet was later edited to remove the video.

Israel Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lior Haiat told CNN: “We received the video, we thought it was from an official source but when we contacted him he said he got it from somewhere else, so we took it off.”""

Not exactly lying but what is the purpose of presenting misleading information from an unverified source? Why not stick to verified fact?"

"From my experience as an Iraqi - Al Jazeera English (not the Arabic network) was much more truthful in reporting on the Iraq conflict that any of the major American networks.  They were willing to confront the abuses of the American military much earlier than the networks in the West - who often relied and trusted military and government sources.

Al Jazeera has its biases, like every news organization, but it does hold its staff to high journalistic standards.  It is more like the BBC than like Fox News, although a BBC with an Arab world perspective."
"No where does it say they think that it’s an Israeli bomb. They say the damage is inconsistent with previous uses of Israeli bombs, but do say that it doesn’t rule out the possibility of it being a different type of munition, such as an air burst one. 

They point out some inconsistencies with the Israeli version of events and that Hamas says they have proof that it was Israeli, but they haven’t provided it to anyone. 

All this says is that no one is actually sure yet and doesn’t draw any conclusions."
Channel 4 is like the Toronto Sun of Britain.
who debunked the evidence in the video pray tell? and where is your evidence?
"Regardless of what hospital they meant, that’s why the world thought why they thought"
Neutral news sources lmao
"What makes a “neutral news source”. I honestly have no idea what happened and I will not claim otherwise, largely because no neutral news source exists. 

I am assuming by neutral, you mean American/European/Canadian. These countries, ESPECIALLY America, are not neutral in the slightest. The US sends billions of dollars of aid to Israel so it’s not a great look for them if said aid is used to bomb hospitals. Britain is a major contributor to this whole mess from a historical perspective (read stuff about the Balfour declaration, Sykes-Picot agreement and Hussain-McMahon correspondence and the British mandate if you would like a good history lesson). The UK and US are Canada’s two biggest allies. 

Before you come after me saying “that’s why the government is not neutral, but news orgs are” think about how news orgs just write exactly what governments say 90% of the time. Sure there will be analysis sometimes/eventually but the initial reporting is almost always “leaked classified intelligence says this, therefore it’s true” 

(I am also not some crazy conspiracy nut, I have reasonable trust in the news. I just consume media from several high quality news outlets from several different countries/perspective. I don’t just blindly accept what CBC/National post/CNN/BBC etc say without reading another article or two on the topic)"
Yeah my point is just that people are saying the news was so stupid to report that it was an Israeli rocket but that’s not so stupid when the Israeli govt said it was their rocket originally
I dont know what happened but the fact that the US has taken Israel's word for it means absolutely nothing to me.
"they still rushed to report a fucking rumour and a day later you had the IDF saying they couldn't confirm it, but the cat was out of the bag already."
"There was an independent investigation by the US, and the 10-50 estimate is from the European Intelligence, US intel estimates 100-300, but that was released before the AFP.

As you can see in the pictures, the hospital was not striked, and most western intelligence agencies have confirmed it was very likely from a Hamas rocket. There is audio, video, and witness evidence to corroborate these findings.

"People often turn to substances to soothe trauma, so yeah it’s kinda exactly like that"
Yeah I agree.  This conflict is going to be fueled by right wing propaganda and a lot more innocent Palestinians will die before anyone stands up for them beside Ireland and Spain.
Yeah it's pretty telling why Trudeau hasn't followed suit with Washington and the EU blaming Hamas.  Actually says a lot about his character
No one targeted the hospital
It’s a good question.
There it is.
Anti vaxxers?
"Ohhhhhh it’s “IMPLIED”.  So, you filled in the blank to assign blame to fit the narrative you want to assume it meant.  

Targeting hospital IS a war crime and IS unacceptable. 

You just go ahead and create the reality you want from there, I guess"

It’s easy to be ignorant. It hard to face the genocide happening. Hope you can open your eyes. Thanks
The reports were from Israel as well the Christian organization that owned the hospital.
"Exactly, when they lied to gain sympathy. Now you’re figuring it out. So they deleted the tweet because of the backlash from the entire world."
"The issue isn't whether or not whether the US is capable of finding intel, the issue is whether the US will be truthful with the intel that it has."

I don't know if you are being sarcastic but they absolutely did not. US intelligence was talking about an invasion since late 2021.
"No I think the point is we shouldn't take any of the primary or secondary actors at face value. Hamas, Israel, US, Iran - none of them can be trusted to put out accurate information."

"Most news outlets ran with the Israel bombed the hospital based solely on the word of ""Palestinian health officials"" which is essentially just a Hamas militant. There were no pictures of the hospital. No pictures of the blast. They just took a terrorist's word at face value. Absolutely pathetic."
"So many Redditors don't see this side at all.

Israelis have tried their current approach for decades and only brought more misery. How is this time any different? There will come a time when they both need to reevaluate their positions but I have zero confidence in Bibi on this one. Not sure about Hamas, but they would recognize Israel at the 1967 borders, so they have changed their tune before."
"Hamas has been making Palestinians lives miserable. How many billions have been donated? They're too busy diverting resources like cement and piping to build tunnels and rockets instead of water mains and schools, and then bragging about it on social media. How much better would their lives be if they stopped firing rockets and trying to kill Jews at every opportunity? How much better would their lives be if they didn't resort to terrorism? 

For one, there wouldnt be blockades. Secondly, Gaza shares a border with Egypt why don't other Arab countries want to help? Egypt is just as guilty of blocking their border. No one has a bone to pick with them. They are treated the way they are because of decisions they have made over the last 20-30 years."
Lmao yah ok. If Hamas were to surrender today there would be peace. If Israel were to surrender today there would be no more Jews.
The solution isn’t to let the lion have more autonomy
"So what's your excuse for the mass murder and atrocities committed in 2005 when Gaza was handed over complete with a fully functioning industry and there was no cage?

What's your excuse for the mass murder and atrocities committed in 1966 when Jordan and Egypt had been in charge of the West Bank and Gaza for *20 years* and they were 100% Judenrein?

What's your excuse for the mass murder and atrocities committed in 1947 when the Arabs had been given three whole states and offered a majority of the fourth?

What's your excuse for the mass murder and atrocities committed in 1929 when there was no state of Israel, no cage, no refugees, no settlements, just jewish families disemboweled alive and their children raped to death in their own parents guts?

The problem with your argument is that it simply doesn't work. Every single time there's been a massacre of Jews people like you have come out of the woodwork to excuse it. But there was always another atrocity [*before* that excuse](https://david-collier.com/arab-knife-excuses/)."
"they were referring to hamas in that statement,    


and they were animals."
"So back to the point, take no sides, the other option is to support murderers."

"They could have done that decades ago, meanwhile the population of Gaza has increased significantly over the years. The Israelis seem to be pretty bad at genocide."
You saw what happened in less than two weeks with only air strikes and plenty of measures to minimize civilian casualties. It is clear they could wipe out Palestine in less than 70 days much less 70 years.

"I agree with your point that they're different situations, but I don't really get why appeasement was brought up. Isn't the appeasement part only at the start of the war? When Denmark and Norway hadn't yet been invaded, and France hadn't yet been taken over? 

Though when Norway got invaded they dropped the whole ""Appeasement"" thing when Churchhill came in and fought Germany alone (European theatre) for a year before the Nazis invaded Russia and became their enemies. Which is what the guy you're replying to probably meant"
"It'd be more black in white if it was just IDF vs Hamas and IDF could eliminate Hamas cleanly, they'd deserve it and it'd be cool, but I don't think that's the way this plays out. And what's the final solution? Probably the same thing in 20 years."

"Not sure how hard they’ve tried to avoid that when they literally dropped thousands of bombs on Gaza.

"Was the entirety of Ukraine occupied by the Russia since 2006, all entry and exits controlled by the need for permits? Were water and energy turned off in the entirety of the Ukraine?"
Great point. Only one side has taken civilian hostages.
"Gosh you are so brainwashed, it's truly sad... THE ONLY comeback you and people who defend actions of Israel have is that Hamas is hiding amongst civilians and therefore, it's ok to kill the civilians....YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR DECADES and where has it gotten you? 

Slowly the whole world is seeing the through your lies and propaganda... 

You repeat the old IDF talking points...Yes true, Hamas IS probably hiding amongst civilians but it is a WAR CRIME to then go and bomb those civilians to kill your enemy...

Hence you would be committing war crimes....not that Israel caress about this because it knows with the US's support, it will never EVER need to be held accountable...."

"Yep, china does something similar with their space program, you don't have to look far to find videos of their rocket parts burning away in Chinese villages, and those are orbital class rockets designed by actual rocket scientists and purpose built, hamas rockets are unguided and essentially the same quality as amateur shed made fireworks with a lethal warhead instead of sparklers and stars"

I haven't jumped to conclusions.
"Committing war crimes and murdering thousands of children to “coax” the opposition. 

✨Just IOF things ✨"
"Of course killing 1400 Israelis in one day is BLOODY MASSACARE.

Of course going and killing innocent israelis who just wanna get on with their lives IS WRONG period.

One can be for palestinians and NOT for Hamas....I swear, it is possible

But please - let's just realize and agree that this conflict did not start a week ago and ask the most important question that NO ONE is asking...

WHY did 1400 have to die last two weeks ago? WHY did Hamas go into Israel and kill all those innocent people? WHY?

To say Hamas is a terrorist group is NOT the answer...

I am afraid the answer is a lot more uglier than most Israelis are prepared to hear or want to admit to...

The WHY opens up a can of warm about the Palestinian struggle....the land dispute, the dehumanization of them, the marginalization of them by everyone even corrupt dirty disgusting ARAB LEADERS, the constant killing of their youth and so on and so forth.

Until Palestinians are seen, heard, acknowledged and recognized and treated as humans, this cycle will continue....in ten 20  years, there will likely be another Saturday where a different group will break into another village in Israel and kill families and babies... I am sorry but this is just how this story being going on simply because Israel pushes Palestinians to the side, treats them like dirt, and keeps taking up their land to build jewish settlments on.."
"Well, also that Israel has been bombing Gaza and openly threatened hospitals the day before and then again the very same day. But agreed, Israeli would actually have more to lose by lying and saying they weren’t responsible and getting found out then for just saying it was an accident. So, the chances it was Israel aren’t high."
Well no evidence other than the fact that Israel bombed the same hospital multiple times previously and the hospital’s management publicly asserted that they were directly threatened by the IOF after the most recent bombing.
"While you’re not fully wrong - they were far from the same Hamas back then.  They were actually a hope for a peaceful government.  I won’t go into the history of it and i suspect you might be aware of it but are just grasping to somehow heap more blame on Israel. 

Israel is the only country on the planet - literally the only one -  that has to convince people they didn’t deserve to have their women and children raped and murdered and burned in the street. 

This world is fucked up."
"Zionism and immigration to Palestine started before WW1 in response to increased Anti-Semitic sentiment and attacks in Europe especially in France and Russia. There were immigrations of Jews to Palestine even before that but Zionism is the modern movement.

After WW1, fighting and riots broke out between Arabs and Jews including full on armed revolts against their British masters and each other. More often than not it was the Arabs who were the aggressors and rioters. After WW2 where British control over the region broke down in favor of civil war and they ran away like cowards as per usual.

Israel declared independence and won against the disorganized Arab forces leading to the neighboring Arab nations declaring war, taking in the Arab refugees that fled, conscripting their forces and taking their land (Mostly Jordan and Egypt). They lost that war and several more without a true solution to the Palestinian cause. No one even in the Arab world cares about Palestinians unless it hurts Israel, many of the descendants of the Arab refugees are still technically refugees as their home country refuses to grant them citizenship despite multiple generations being born there."
"They killed 1200 civilians, raped women, and burned babies. But it is important to mention that the babies weren't decapitated, they were just gunned down. 

Really good of you to act all offended because someone got that fact wrong, calling him what he is, a propagandist for having this detail wrong. Thanks for the really useful clarification bud, this changes everything. Keep up the good work!"
"40 babies were murdered, but only few of them were beheaded"
You're right. Only some babies were beheaded. Not all 40. My mistake.

Algos copy and pasting are thriving.
Life expectancy is pretty average (74.4). The reason their population is so young is because they have a high fertility rate and people marry younger.
"Hamas are terrorists, and if you support them, you're a bad person."
"The timestamp of that first video was very close to the time of the explosion (within an hour I think). 

I’m not sure if the exact time of the explosion was confirmed at that point either.

So I can see how someone could check the timestamp and think that it fit the timeline.

With regards to the call, this is the first time I’m hearing of claims about the accents of the people who were recorded. I can’t speak Arabic myself so I’d be interested in knowing who determined that the accents were off."
"Unlike Canada, renown for treating natives well now and throughout history."
"I'd say the report from actual Hamas, the literal inciting party in this conflict. Probably has a more biased perspective to it than the US."
lmao
You know you’re wrong when your response to children being indiscriminately killed is that it’s acceptable collateral damage. If you want to condemn Hamas for their brutality and inhumanity then it’s completely hypocritical and morally indefensible not to condemn the same behavior by the IDF.
"It's nice to just make up stuff.

But if you're looking for facts, in the last week Gaza has fired 450 rockets and Israel has fired 6000.   

Everyone knows that Israel has been bombing the crap out of Gaza, especially since people who support the bombing continue to remind them of the fact that they are raining fire down on Gaza."
"Bad aim? To make it look like Hamas? 

I'm not saying Israel necessarily did it just that it seems odd that out of all the places for it to happen makes it odd"
"If you believe this you are a child. In addition, almost every independent investigation has poked gigantic holes in the official IDF statement about the event. For starters, the “intercepted conversation” between the Hamas fighters admitting they fucked up the rocket launch has proven to be a hilariously bad fake. According to most Arab journalists, the syntax, accent and idiom usage is highly inconsistent with the way Gazans speak. One of the “hamas fighters” apparently doesn’t even sound like a native Arab speaker. 

Furthermore, audio analysis experts are all but in agreement that the recording utilities both left and right audio channels to suggest that it was recorded in stereo. While it’s not completely impossible, it’s likely that a recording of a conversation would be captured in mono. 

So if the IDF has allegedly faked a conversation with “Hamas” fighters admitting that they mistakenly bombed the Al Alhi hospital in error, why in the fuck would anything else they say be taken seriously or have any credibility. 

But as usual, don’t take my word for it

"Because Hamas uses civilian infrastructure to fire rockets, uses palestinians of all ages as human shields and wants as many deaths as possible to play victim and rally support. Israel on the other hand will do everything it can to protect its citizens.

"Palestine has had every possibility to rebuild. Israel gave up the West Bank and Gaza when it could have kept on to it and let Palestinians rebuild. What can any country when you constantly aggrandized by your neighbouring country.

that's a good question though if you think about the fuel is highly flammable and the thing was jam packed with it as the rocket was supposed to hit haifa which is 152 km. Not sure how much fuel that is or the math on how much bigger the explosion would be but it would add up I did find this discussion on it though which seems to suggest that the propellant can indeed explode under right condition and I think a 150kg detonation could do the trick https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/50069/have-any-rocket-fuel-systems-actually-been-explosive-and-could-have-detonated-p

Not a news source of record or with a global reach, but respected, and with a centre-left leaning. It has had a number of major scoops and is generally seen as being more willing to hold the government's feet to the fire than the two other major 'terrestrial' news broadcasters, but it lacks the prestige of the BBC and the audience of ITV."
"This video I think is the most clear https://reddit.com/r/2ndYomKippurWar/s/S2PvbBFkYQ

"Agreed, legacy media needs to tread much more cautiously."
"The US is not 'independent' in this case, sorry to say. They are Israel's most vocal (and powerful) allies. Your 2 sources pointed are from: US + Israel news sites.

The US president also made statements about the 40 decapitated babies, that turned out to be, not true.

Again, all news during the events like this are suspect and need to be treated as such is my point.

It could very well be 100% true what you are saying, but given how doctored photos were provided by Israel to support this to begin with (i.e.: here's the blast... oops, the time stamps don't line up) it's oK to question and be mindful."
"Totally agree!  And, the idea of '500' (super round number, super quick) is very suspect. Well, clearly just straight up unproven.

Both sides are not being transparent, both sides see an advantage in blaming the other.

It wouldn't surprise me if Hamas was launching from near the hospital (as typical) and Israel auto-replied and blammo, oops. But Israel would never admit it.

It also wouldn't surprise me if Hamas hit this hospital to gain more support from other Arab countries, be it accidentally or intentionally, and go 'see how bad they are!'.

Just really sucks either way, especially kids on either side."
"Because it wasn't just Hamas reporting it. It was also hospital staff.   With regards too the numbers Shifa hospital

Yes. Isreal has a myriad of issues with their story. They used a video from the wrong time. They used audio in which the speakers use the wrong dialect. So why trust the radar? Their defense seems to be we had a plane in the area but it didn't bomb the hospital."

You're the one who seems to be living in an alternate reality. Israel is responding to terrorist attacks by taking out Hamas targets. It was Hamas that committed war crimes by torturing raping and killing innocent civilians. Israel is warning Gaza's ahead of time to evacuate targets. Why would they all of a sudden drop a bomb on a hospital parking lot? The impact crater is even inconsistent with anything they've fired. It is consistent with shitty rockets that Hamas has been firing towards Israel attempting to kill civilians. Common sense.

"I mean Israel did not target the hospital, but Trudeau's choice of words can be used from either side of the conflict."
Where did he say target hospitals? Why do you think he wouldn't tell off Hamas for attacking hospitals?

"How bad do you have to be at genocide when the ""genocided"" population keeps growing?"
Edit: I want to make it clear for you incase you didn’t get it. They deleted the tweet to lie again to change the narrative.
CCP would disagree.
Doesn't change the fact.
And 9/11.
"No, it's a fact."
[removed]
Definitely being sarcastic. Virtually everyone was claiming US intel was wrong and that there was no imminent invasion. Even Zelenskyy himself.
That we can agree on. I just wish the media had taken your advice.
"Reading comprehension, man.

He said that bombing hospital is bad, he said nothing about who did it."
"Do you think it's legal and acceptable?

He smartly hedged everything."
Swing and a miss
Thanks for the source that proves the above person correct. His response was absolutely neutral and could be applicable to either side. Literally all he said was that the attack was bad and that people should learn to follow international rules. Did you not bother to read the source before sending it to try and prove your point? Absolutely embarrassing.
"> “The news coming out of Gaza is horrific and absolutely unacceptable,” Trudeau correctly told reporters. He should’ve stopped there. Instead, he continued: “International humanitarian and international law needs to be respected in this, and in all cases. There are rules around wars and it’s not acceptable to hit a hospital.”

I assume they are missing the part where he accused Israel, can you share?"
"1. That’s an opinion piece, not journalism 

2. You don’t seem to have even read it because halfway through the author states “While he didn’t mention Israel by name, the implication was clear as day.”


Although you could learn a thing or two about rushing to make judgements before understanding the facts."
And what does this have to do with Trudeau?
"Have actually been to Israel as a UN peacekeeper.  This was before the internet became ubiquitous.  Israel were the ones to constantly break the no-fly zone rules, but nothing Hamas has done is acceptable either.  

It's actually wild to me how everyone needs to pick sides and not acknowledge the possibility that both suck, and we should support the civilians caught in this middle of a dick-measuring contest"
">  but they would recognize Israel at the 1967 borders

You do realise that the ""1967 borders"" were the *result* of the surrounding Arab states attempting to exterminate the entire Jewish race, right? They literally murdered every single living Jew in the entire West Bank, Gaza, and half of Jerusalem. Those aren't ""borders"" any more than the eventual line where the Nazis advance was stopped in Europe were ""borders"". Their charter also literally calls for the complete genocide of the Jewish people. 

And while we're at it how does your excuse jive with the fact that Arabs were slaughtering jews going all the way back to [before the state of Israel was founded](https://david-collier.com/arab-knife-excuses/)?"
We’re at a point where we go around the same circle every few years.  Each side performs the same actions and is expecting a different outcome
"Because Israel, or more specifically BB’s party has worked tirelessly to ensure a two state solution is impossible. The international community (mostly the US) needs to pressure Israel into moving towards a two-state solution, or some other recognition of a Palestinian state.

That said, and I feel the need to caveat this every time I critique either nation in this conflict, I acknowledge HAMAS calls for the explicit genocide of Jews from the Middle East. Obviously this terrorist government would need to be ousted before peace is possible (which should be possible, HAMAS support amongst Palestinians was fairly low prior to these attacks).

Organizations like the PLO have attempted to work with Israel in the past. Both the Oslo and Napkin accords failed due to Israeli malevolence, and they need to be pressured into acknowledging Palestinian statehood (after land swaps, etc).

If Israel can share a border with Syria and Lebanon, they can share a border with a Palestinian state."
"Peace?  The Palestinians would still be living in sub human conditions.  There won't be peace until everyone has the basic necessities of life, including freedom.  There won't be peace while 2M+ people are living in an open air prison.  Why is this so hard to understand, that killing and oppressing other human beings isn't okay?"
The solution is also not to keep poking the lion and then going all pikachu face when the lion’s cubs hate you
"Evidently, it was an imperfect metaphor, though the point being made was pretty clear imo."
By refusing all of gaza food and water they are doing collective punishment which is a war crime.
"But there has to be understanding of truth of the situation. Israel has more weapons and is highy militarized and has killed far more palestinians than hamas has killed israelis. Israel is a nation holding palestinians in apartheid like conditions. So while hamas is doing bad things and killing, Israel is also doing bad things. Israel is being protected/supported by the US and Britain and their bad deeds are not acknowledged"
Israel is meeting the 10 stages of genocide. You don't understand what genocide means.
"They updated their charter in 2017 which states that the group doesn't seek war with the Jewish people but only against Zionism. 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas_Charter"
"So under your sense of morality if there was risk of even 1 German civilian dying during WW2, the whole fight just wasn’t worth it?"
So both sides.
"Only one side has used 21st century weaponry to indiscriminately kill and murder civilians including women and children.

Don’t pretend this is a war of equals when one side has sophisticated weaponry and the other side barely has food or water.  Terrorism and taking civilian hostages is never okay, but Israel’s response has been sub-human."
Spoiler alert: there are over a thousand Palestinians detained in Israel without a charge.
"I mean, that is a terribly biased source. There are many centrist summaries on the conflict, and that ain't one of them."
You are claiming Israel took the land from Palestine.  That was Britain.  Are you going to also justify the Hamas terror attacks because Palestinians were suppressed?  What do you think the outcome would of been without Iran funding a terrorist group to literally terrorize Israel through Palestine territories?  Hamas and Iran are the bad guys.  Both Israel and Palestinians have suffered.  Blaming Israel is short sighted and out of touch with history.
Interesting prison. Somehow all these weapons and materials for endless rockets make it inside though.
"Yes, I can blame him. Doubly so for not taking it back."
"Umm Israel never attacked first and stated it would stop fighting when the hostages are released. Name a country that wouldn't protect its citizens.  Carpet bombing or hitting targets? Hamas is using citizens as a shield, they clearly don't care if citizens die. Israel has the right to protect itself."
"Thats good but not what I meant lol.

In any case , time will tell.

I will be absolutely shocked if any evidence is ever enough."
"Murdering thousands of children. Oh boy.

Simply delusional"
"Fuck off with the Hamas are little baddies buuuuut……and then all the other bullshit. 

Hans is not fighting for Palestinian freedom or Palestinian anything. No one benefits more from dead Palestinians than Hamas."
[Netanyahu was saying as recently as 2019 that Israel should continue supporting Hamas](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/)
"Propaganda, def: information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view. Don't you get all flared up with the baby beheading mentions ? I do."
"I'd say if you include palestinians, a lot more babies were murdered. But neither side has been able to provide proof that one single baby was beheaded."
"Sure sure. ""I lied, but it's awful to point it out"""
"CNN has pored through hundreds of hours of media posted online attempting to corroborate accounts of atrocities committed by Hamas. In one video, which CNN determined to be authentic but has not been able to geolocate, an assailant attacks an injured man with a garden tool in an attempt to behead him. But CNN has not seen anything that would appear to confirm the claims of decapitated children.

Yeah you'll have to provide a source on this one chief.
Excellent example of above mentioned sophism.
Its more like the palestinian double standards are sickening. “How dare israel defend itself against terorists whose sole goal is to kill jews and destroy isreael!!??
you probably believe anything the US/isreal says. keep lying to yourself
"Personally I don’t believe any side during a conflict because frankly,  they would be stupid at not to lie in their own favour. Propaganda is step 1 to winning and fighting any war. It’s the same way I feel about Russia and Ukraine too. 

but this event is the most widely reported on story in the world right now. If out of 50 (example) different countries reporting. Only Israel and USA+allies are saying it’s Hamas. And another 40 others are saying it’s unconfirmed, but likely Isreal. All while they present different evidence or reasoning. Doesn’t that make you doubt?"
"Before the creation of Israel over 90% of the population that lived there was non-Jewish. Suddenly here comes a state that wants to be Jewish majority, which means the people living there would have to be kicked out.

Those people and their descendants are the ones in Gaza and elsewhere. You talk about Jews being chased out or killed but you are describing the plight of the Palestinians."
"I hadn’t seen that so I appreciate the update though I would hardly consider the Times of Israel to be anything even approaching an unbiased source. 

It doesn’t change the fact that it never should have been turned off in the first place. The language Israel has been using has made it very clear that they refuse to differentiate between the innocent civilians in Gaza and Hamas."
"In this case yes, but not normally. Israel would not allow an open border with Egypt if there was no conflict.

Israel would absolutely love all Gazans to simply move into Egypt, with the conflict as a pretext, and have them become refugees there, so that Israel can take over Gaza and give it back to the Jewish settlers. 

Jordan and Egypt don't want the refugees because they would still be stateless refugees that they will now have to house, integrate, and manage politically - and it is not their responsibility or obligation to do so."
Honestly brother there’s no point arguing with propaganda machines. Talking to you about basic humanity and you’re arguing about avg age and sending people to Egypt who have nothing to do with this. All you guys are repeating the same shit that lacks any humanity. Suck it.
"The only reason you'd think I support Hamas is if you think all brown folks support Hamas. You work with the assumption of guilt. That's called bigotry babes, not a good look."
"The whole of North America and South America is the same story while we're at it. And nothing happened. No justice to those that got invaded.

We ignored it.

Why do you think it's happening again?"
">the literal inciting party in this conflict.

This gave me quite a chuckle. 

After the war on terror and the years of lies about made up weapons of mass destruction  there should be plenty of skepticism towards the US. 

They've backed Israel through their years of war crimes and apartheid because it suits them to keep a strong ally in the region. If the US was unbiased they would have called the country out decades ago and actually tried to fix the situation."
"Yes, Hamas is the inciting party lol"
Suggest a better way to eliminate Hamas with less bloodshed?
"I think you are getting numbers confused

*Since the war began, the military said in a statement that roughly 450 rockets fired at Israel by militant groups had landed in Gaza, “endangering and harming the lives of Gazan residents.”*

"There isn’t really even a crater. Israeli weapons would leave a massive crater and damage the surrounding buildings a lot worse.

I would agree with this.
There were numerous Canadians that were killed by Hamas and many more that are being held hostage in Gaza. It involves us whether we like it or not.

Well how about you provide evidence the IDF did it?
"That doesn't support what you said, they didn't bomb people trying to evacuate as you claimed.  

It says 13 of the 500,000+ people who evacuated ended up dying in a strike outside the evacuation zone. It's shit luck and unfortunate, but it's not Israel bombing people evacuating."
"Don't spread misinformation. The Tweet, if it even existed, was by a social media influencer."
That first paragraph is surely satire? Like it's not possible to have this much cognitive dissonance.
"It's not ""just"" Semantics though. These ""semantics"" have real world consequences. 

There's only one party who would bomb anything inside Gaza - the party which is at war with Hamas obviously. So a head of state saying that '*the* bombing of *the* hospital' when, context, all of the major news networks also say ""ISRAEL bombed.."" or ""ISRAEL striked"" all adds up to give a very distorted image - one which was directly responsible for thrown molotovs at synagogues and fueling hate against Jews throughout the world."
there are some very disingenuous people in this thread.  to the level i do not know if you are poking fun of me for understanding what justin said... or the morons who believe justin was talking about the russians bombing the hospital.  painful.

\>3. What are the most important principles governing occupation?    
The duties of the occupying power are spelled out primarily in the 1907 Hague Regulations (arts 42-56) and the Fourth Geneva Convention (GC IV, art. 27-34 and 47-78), as well as in certain provisions of Additional Protocol I and customary international humanitarian law.  
Agreements concluded between the occupying power and the local authorities cannot deprive the population of occupied territory of the protection afforded by international humanitarian law (GC IV, art. 47) and protected persons themselves can in no circumstances renounce their rights (GC IV, art. 8).  
The main rules o f the law applicable in case of occupation state that:  
The occupant does not acquire sovereignty over the territory.  
Occupation is only a temporary situation, and the rights of the occupant are limited to the extent of that period.  
...  
To the fullest extent of the means available to it, the occupying power must ensure sufficient hygiene and public health standards, as well as the provision of food and medical care to the population under occupation.  
...  
Collective or individual forcible transfers of population from and within the occupied territory are prohibited.  
...  
Transfers of the civilian population of the occupying power into the occupied territory, regardless whether forcible or voluntary, are prohibited.  
...  
Collective punishment is prohibited.  
...  
The confiscation of private property by the occupant is prohibited.  
People accused of criminal offences shall be provided with proceedings respecting internationally recognized judicial guarantees (for example, they must be informed of the reason for their arrest, charg ed with a specific offence and given a fair trial as quickly as possible)."
Who calls to kill or exterminate Palestinians?
Then what about armed Israeli settlers illegally running Bedouins off their land in the West Bank to make it impossible for Palestine to have a contiguous state? What do you call that?
"So you don't like the Israelis?

Deir Yassin.  Look it up."
It barely has a bias and definitely has less of a bias than Al Jazeera
"Meh, the live Al Jazeera broadcast is all that's needed to prove the lies and pathetic deception by the Palestinian Government."
"""The accidental explosion"", ""The explosion caused by a failed rocket"". The truth fits pretty well."
Then what is the reason for not understanding the politics of a politician who is so obviously scripted?

It is still far more probable that this was Israel than anything else, given that they are currently using Gaza like a firing range.

"Al Jazeera is a Qatari news organization. Qatar is a supporter of Hamas/Hezbollah. They're as trustworthy as the israel times in this conflict.

There was no Israeli air activity in the area (public data), so it's definitely not an air strike. Maybe a missile would have been possible, but there were no reported missiles/rockets launched from Israel.

2. Every piece of evidence I've seen put forward of IDF forces using it has been 'White smoke, must be WP!', no consideration of circumstances which generally point to regular old smoke rounds

3. The one video I've seen consistently touted as evidence is of a single munition. Generally speaking it doesn't make sense to use WP in single as it's pretty indiscriminate, hence the reputation. Instead it's generally used en masse for area denial, making it very easy to tell when it is being used - and also a terrible idea for use in a situation like Gaza.

I'm sure there will be/have been questionable actions by the IDF, and I'm all for holding both sides accountable, but there's just nothing there for WP that I've seen. Better to look at the lower amount of 'roof-knocking' the IDF loves to trumpet."

"> two state solution

There's already a four state solution. The Arabs were given three states out of the British and French mandates and they chose genocide. They had **20 years** to create a fifth Arab state while Jordan and Egypt ruled the West Bank and Gaza, they never did.

This isn't about a state, it's about genocide and it always has been.


>Organizations like the PLO have attempted to work with Israel in the past. Both the Oslo and Napkin accords failed due to Israeli malevolence, 

This is a lie and you know it. It's such a baldfaced lie that even the surrounding Arab states have publicly said that Arafat was solely to blame for the failure of peace efforts. Israel has offered everything short of voluntarily walking its citizens into gas chambers and it's been refused every time.

The reason there is no peace is the same reason there were massacres and atrocities committed *before* every excuse ever made, going back to [before Israel was reestablished](https://david-collier.com/arab-knife-excuses/)."
"They live in an open air prison because they elected terrorist organization and would ship weapons in from Iran wholesale if the blockade dropped

There will never be peace while Hamas remains an entity in Gaza"
"So what's your excuse for the mass murder and atrocities committed in 2005 when Gaza was handed over complete with a fully functioning industry and there was no cage?

What's your excuse for the mass murder and atrocities committed in 1966 when Jordan and Egypt had been in charge of the West Bank and Gaza for *20 years* and they were 100% Judenrein?

What's your excuse for the mass murder and atrocities committed in 1947 when the Arabs had been given three whole states and offered a majority of the fourth?

What's your excuse for the mass murder and atrocities committed in 1929 when there was no state of Israel, no cage, no refugees, no settlements, just jewish families disemboweled alive and their children raped to death in their own parents guts?

The problem with your argument is that it simply doesn't work. Every single time there's been a massacre of Jews people like you have come out of the woodwork to excuse it. But there was always another atrocity [*before* that excuse](https://david-collier.com/arab-knife-excuses/).

Why is *this* so hard for you to understand?"
"Israël is a man with a gun to the lion’s head, having previously offered it its own territory and freedom. Yet the beast continues to kill anything near its cage rather than choosing peace and autonomy. 

When the only option the lion will ever settle for, by its own admission, is the extermination of every Jew around it, at some point that trigger is going to get pulled"
Please explain to me why you think israel needs to supply Gaza with any food or water?
So you're saying that the allies are all guilty of a war crime for not actively giving Hitler supplies during World War 2?
"They are acknowledged, just look at all the protests and members of the US congress complaining. The difference of capabilities is real, but that doesn’t matter, Hamas has in its charter the eradication of all Jews and even points out how hard it will be to kill Jews not living in Israel.

Also, if you think this is about Israel and Palestine you are naive, this is about Iran, Israel, Lebanon, US, Russia, Pakistan, etc. The head of Hamas lives in Qatar and functions with money from Iran, same case for Hezbollah, so the less resources argument is flawed; Israel adversaries have a lot of money, they just prefer to engage in a proxy war using Palestinians as tools to inflict political and material damage to Israel.

And note I’m not excusing Israel, the blockade is barbaric, but the situation is way more complicated than Palestine versus Israel, there is a reason Zelenskyy expressed support for Israel, that being Rusia is aligned with Iran and using its drones. Again, Iran and its allies are using Palestinians and the power disparity is understood as they do."
">Israel has more weapons and is highy militarized and has killed far more palestinians than hamas has killed israelis.

And the only people claiming that are those with a reason to say so.

We never get the true data. It is always pro-something. Either pro-palastine, pro-hamas, or pro-israel.

Like I know it sounds good point fingers at israel or palastine and hamas, but none of this would be happening right now if palastine would do something against militant cells like hamas. All of this is happening right now because hamas is being given free reign of operation.

That is just a fact.

Now does that excuse israel? of course not. However, when one side is not playing the game in good faith, you are going to have something like this happen."
"No they aren't. Maybe according to some warped agenda. The palistinians are free to stop adopting terror tactics at any time, get the Egyptian border open and use aid to build a functioning society. They have no intention of doing this. They are more than happy sacrificing their own people so long as they kill Jews."
">the group doesn't seek war with the Jewish people

[I'm sure that's their intention. /s](https://twitter.com/amjadt25/status/1712391641900761592?s=61&t=djpbV4Qy3ReEtZHbEF5BvA)"
"So what page is mowing down civilians, women and children and rape of Jews on? Is it after the indiscriminate firing of thousands of rockets filled with shrapnel in the general direction of Israel page? 

They want to clear Jews from the land. Presumably where? Other Arab nations? Where Jews were murdered and kicked out prior to the creation of Israel? So they no longer want to murder all Jews, just remove them from the lands and have their neighbors murder them instead. Seems reasonable."
I don't think there is ever a moral reason to wage war.
This is the answer there is no good guy in war
"Yup, treating the Palestinians like dog crap every single day isn’t going to make things better.  Hamas launch by a terror attack and killing Israeli civilians also isn’t making things better.  Bombing Palestine and killing civilians en masse certainly isn’t making things better."
"Never said it wasn't, my point was that it's the other perspective. I'm a white Canadian with no ties to either side. But the source I provided is informative from the Palestinian side of their entire experience. Not just relevant to this conflict.

The reason I shared it is the same reason I don't push centrists sources to inform on the indigenous peoples experience here in Canada."

"I can't. I think everyone who believes that Israel didn't do it are bloodthirsty, unserious rubes. You can't know for certain before a ceasefire and independent investigation, if even then. 

The IDF is the least reliable source on its own actions. I'd trust the boy who cried wolf before I ever trusted a word the IDF said without independent verification. They've proven they can't be trusted."
"When Israel ""does things first"", it's not considered an attack. Only Hamas and Palestinians are ever seen as acting out. Everything Israel and the IDF gets up to is apparently just vengeance.

"How can a settler colonial occupying regime ever claim self-defence?

If I told you families were tied down in the living room and tortured in front of each other. Mutilating their bodies Mc plucking out eyeballs, and hacking of limbs, then shooting burning and shooting them in the head. that's all ok bc they didn't actually use a shovel to behead the babies?"
"Main factor in ethics & international law is intention, the intention in this case to kill babies, numbers need context. presenting numbers of dead is meaningless without context, btw that's the literal definition of self defense, you're alive but the assailant is dead, doesn't make you 'the bad guy'"
You are free to point it out. It just makes you look callous and incapable to see what actually matters. Makes your opinions sound really dumb.

After you
israel has been bombing Palestine for decades. the word terrorist is a propaganda tool. what did you just expect the people of Palestine to not build hate and resentment after decades of israel rule?
Please stop with this complete and utter misinformation.
Where? Gaza Israel? That's a lot more complicated than the native American genocide.
I’m not saying the US is unbiased in saying they’re not a literal party to this conflict. If you’re a cop (gross) and arrive to the sight of a knife fight. You don’t trust one of the idiots with stab wounds. When you ask what happened. You trust some random passerby who happened to witness it.
"Okay yes, but have you thought of this.

Hamas is still a clear and cut terrorist group.

And they are very clear about that themselves."
Like… yes? This most recent conflict was in fact caused by Hamas launching an unprecedented terrorist attack on Israel. I’m sure there’s a hundred year of history you’ve never so much as opened a brittanica article on. But it’s not exactly directly relevant when evaluating the stake about a singular instance of this conflict.
"I don’t have a perfect solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but I can tell you that indiscriminately bombing civilians and vindictively committing equally reprehensible acts of aggression is not it. But acting like whatever the IDF does to retaliate and eliminate Hamas is okay is not right"
"135 vs. 6000?

Bruh."
"Even based on that it makes less sense, if Hamas launched a rocket that failed it would still go boom when it hit something."
Yea but they go after America instead of other heretics because America has positioned itself as Israel's husband
"Of course! However the Palestinian people are in no position to do anything about what is and has been happening to them for the past 70 years.

Israel is."
Hard pass. I honestly don't see a difference between 'terrorized' Israelis settlers and palestinian civilians 'collateral casualties'.
"And many Canadian Palestinians that have suffered under Israel as well lol

What’s your point?"
"Read your own article

>More than 1,000 children have *reportedly* been killed

Who do you think has been doing the reporting?"
"1. IDF tells people in an area to head south to avoid bombing

2. Family asks which road to take 

3. IDF says it doesn’t matter, just head south.

4. Family heads south and shelters 

5. IDF strike kills most of the people in that group.

They MUST shoot rockets from elementary schools!” Remember when India got independence through peaceful protest and making colonial rule look brutal and unhinged? Well get ready for the new and improved strategy of making your country look *more* brutal and insane than the colonizers! Why won’t you support us?"
"They could dig tunnels out into a field and fire from there. Or otherwise just store their rockets in tunnels away from populated areas.

Believe it or not, they're adults who have agency over their decisions are can be held responsible and culpable.

Hamas doesn't fire rockets from dense urban areas because that's their only option. They do it because that way, if Israel fires back, Hamas wins. And if Israel doesn't fire back, Hamas wins."

Hasan has the sources for everything in the video maybe watch it before just dismissing it. Educate yourself ignorance is why they can continue to get away with shit like this.
"You don't get to have the surveillance technology Israel has and make schoolboy errors over the provenance of videos unless 'finding evidence' is more important than the evidence being valid.

  In my opinion Israel was panicking to find an alternative story because they were responsible, its the only plausible explanation in my mind.  If they had nothing to do with it they could have just waited for evidence, but in this instance they had to start the narrative first and then find the evidence."
"I doubt it was the IDF, the evidence adds up to Hamas or IJ.  IDF for example confirmed that their strike damage Orthodox Church in Gaza https://www.reuters.com/world/orthodox-church-says-it-was-hit-by-israeli-air-strike-gaza-2023-10-20/"

Possible Naftali was conflating it with another building that was indeed hit by IAF as many structures are being hit, regardless its a bad look to put something out without having enough facts."
"I've watched the video and I'm honestly not sure. I can see what people are saying about the video, but I'm not sure if the rocket is arching up or if it's coming in more laterally. The other really compelling testimony is that MSF has reported Israel targeting healthcare facilities and ambulances prior to Ahli explosion."
">The rocket used wasn't an Israeli rocket, the lack of a crater means that is didn't come from Israel

Does it? Per MSF that hospital is hit Oct 14 killing/injuring 4 staff but the hospital was still standing Oct 18th for the explosion. 

>Hamas claimed 500 died, why would we trust Hamas?

I definitely don't think anyone should trust Hamas. But their are other people and orgizations in Gaza. Like the medical director for the major hospital reported like 150-200 a long with 300 injuries too that hospital alone. So whatever the number it is much higher then the American/Isreal number of <100."

"I don’t really agree with high immigration numbers, myself honestly. But it’s not solely responsible for the cost of home ownership, degrading standard of healthcare, or stagnant salaries. And I’m not going to call it dumb shit like “mass migration” or “opening up the floodgates”."

Now would you care to show me where in that quote any condemnation of either side or specific group is? Because I'm looking at it, and there is a distinct lack of that. Next time, read the article, not just the headline. The national post is well known to do shit like this, and blow things way past their logical point and exagerate on the truth, especially in their headlines. 

To be honest, it would have been less embarrassing for you if you'd just admitted to not reading the article, than to double down and try to argue that you have a different perspective... And that the perspective you have involves putting words in his mouth."

Most of Gaza is under the age of 18, they didn’t vote for the current administration and know nothing more than living in prison-like conditions.

Similarly, there are 4th generation Israelis, sending them “home” to a country that likely killed and tortured their ancestors also isn’t an option."

This is a false equivalent and as a jewish person offensive
"Israel is surrounded by enemies. That's why the peace accords are so important. Every country that signs is a monkey off its back. The second they let their guard down they can get wiped out. If Hamas lets its guard down, nothing will really happen."
"It's not a ""warped agenda"", it's literally an internationally recognized framework for the commission of genocide."
So you’d just let the Nazis gas all the Jews and conquer Europe??
"Do you know the rate of killing amonst civilians BEFORE this war was 40 to 1....For every 1 civilian Israeli that died, 40 Palestinians were killed....Look at the stats from the previous Gaza wars...

Only this time and God knows HOW, Hamas was able to get through and commit massacres  and war crimes that resulted in so many Israli lives...In previous times, it has ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS been Palestinians who have died in droves under Israeli tanks and bombs"
">Never said it wasn't, my point was that it's the other perspective.

You didn't indicate that, you said it was a ""great source"" which it is far from. And followed it up with an equally questionable fake news link, not a link from the other side, but straight up propaganda."
lol…let’s believe the terrorist organization who benefits the most from as many dead Gazans as possible.
This isn't a lil argument.  Hamas freaking commited a mass murder of citizens.  Canada would definitely hit back if this happened to Canadians.  Canada supports Israel. Odd isn't it?

You know what else is a propoganda tool? the words “occupation”, “genocide” and “ethnic cleansing” as it pertains to israel attacking palestine."
"Yea you don’t have to dig too deep beyond the thin veneer of Israeli propaganda to reach the crux of the issue, and it becomes indefensible to unbelievable pretty quick."
"Largely European descendants occupy and settle a land that they believe they have a (dubious) claim of, while segregating and encroaching on those segregated areas bit by bit with the justification of them being less than human all the while not giving them basic rights within their own country. 

You don’t get to claim a land as your own and kick out the people who live there because of the fact your ancestors from thousands of years ago once had a home there. Could you imagine if turkey decided that Mongolia is rightfully there’s because that’s where the Turkmen originated?"

Prior to the attack this month Israel had been commit crimes against humanity on to the people of Palestine. 

https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution

This wasn't something from decades ago that's in the past now, it was last week, and the ones before that. I don't see how breaking basic international law isn't seen by you as causal to Hamas retaliation."
"They are not indiscriminately bombing, they are attacking Hamas targets. Though by this point I would agree with the criticism that they are overusing air power and probably could have saved civilian lives by moving to a land offensive sooner. That would have cost more IDF lives though.

Anyway the point is moot after Iran's huge propaganda victory with the hospital attack the other night. Israel is right fucked now unfortunately."
">I don’t have a perfect solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict

>But acting like whatever the IDF does to retaliate and eliminate Hamas is okay is not right

Nobody is asking for perfection, but at least suggest a solution that's closer to perfect. Or maybe the current actions already are?"
Rockets and such don’t have massive fireball explosions like seen in the videos. It’s most likely the propellant landed there and the warhead itself landed elsewhere.

Edit: Sorry to be rude, but the fight for Indian independence was extremely violent, took a long time, and was extremely messy (see: Pakistan/India/Bangladesh). The idea that all it took was some peaceful protests is just so reductive."

So you agree that it’s a good tactic ? Who cares why terrorists do what they do. We as humans also have to minimize deaths of other people not just our own countries. We can’t kill a whole country just because some of their people commuted terroristic acts. I would not want to be bombed if Trump or whatver unhinged leader does something vile. And hamas has become synonymous with Palestine and you know it
"Lmao what sort of military advice is “shoot your rockets from an empty field” lmao. That’s how you get immediately spotted and destroyed. These are guerilla tactics. You use guerilla tactics when fighting a superior power because standard tactics don’t work when you’re outmatched. 

Gaza is one of the most densely populated cities on the planet and so to shoot rockets from cover means shooting them from homes, schools and businesses."
"Al Jazeera is based in Qatar and nay analysis they do is fully biased. I wouldn't believe a J post claim either. 

Regardless of what they claim, the LIVESTREAM literally shows a rocket misfire, and all military intelligence in the region supports that the rocket came from the Gaza strip."

"According to the 2016 Census, there were 7,540,830 foreign-born individuals who came to Canada through the immigration process, representing over one-fifth (21.9%) of Canada's total population.
https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/171025/dq171025b-eng.htm

""In 2021, more than 8.3 million people, or almost one-quarter (23.0%) of the population, were, or had ever been, a landed immigrant or permanent resident in Canada. This was the largest proportion since Confederation, topping the previous 1921 record of 22.3%, and the highest among the G7.""

https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/221026/dq221026a-eng.htm

So most immigration occurred prior to Trudeau's time.


>We have 10 million immigrants and less than 8 million boomers, including the ones already died.

""According to Statistics Canada, in 2020 there were about 7.5 million people living in Canada who were born between 1965 and 1980. This was roughly 20 per cent of the country’s population of 38 million at that time.""

https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/generation-x-in-canada

So 7.5 million Xers on top of your boomer 8 who are presently between the ages of 43 to 58. Many no doubt hope to live off their pensions in a decade or less time. 

""Recent immigrants of core working age will be able to work in Canada for a long time, contributing to the country’s workforce and economic growth for many years as a result. With the average retirement age in Canada coming in at 64.4 years in 2021, and over 20% of Canada’s recent immigrants coming to this country between 30 and 34 years old, it can be reasonably expected that they will contribute to Canada’s workforce over nearly the next three decades.""

You cant. No official political parties agree with you. They know this.
"You're legitimately misgided if you think it's viewed as an investment because of immigrants. 

China's ghost cities are there beacuse local Chinese people are unable to invest abroad. It is wildly known that Chinese people do not trust local stocks and would invest their money in housing. Not to mention the severe lack of regulation in China that allowed so much housing to be built with no people to live in them. It was also the only way many municipal governments in China could make money. 

You somehow managed to use an example that contradicts your point. Unless you think ghost cities in Canada would be a good thing? Your example clearly shows that immigrants do not affect the equation much, while government policy has a huge effect. 

Again immigrants are the lowest part of the equation. Start looking at your local governments zoning for the awnsers as to why no one can afford housing. Or the federal government as to why minimum wage employees can't even afford an apartment. Immigrants are again just a scapegoat for shitty politicians."
"I tend to believe the country dropping record numbers of bombs on a people, bombing civilians, committing war crimes, who warned them to evacuate the hospital and a history of lying about it is the most likely is “they”"
It’s their MO
"That’s not the gotcha you think it is. Look at Trudeau’s words, not the editorializing after."
There’s a lot of Doofuses.  You’ll need to be more specific.

"It's quite remarkable how you knew exactly what I was talking about when all I said was ""Mask Off"". It's almost as if you had some ulterior motive in saying what you said, as if it was, I don't know, a code for something. So strange. I'll bet you have ""88"" reasons for what you said."
"If it was a failed rocket and the hospital wasn’t targeted, do his criticisms about international law still apply? It sounds like he’s suggesting the hospital was deliberately targeted, which is a significant point of contention here, and implies Israel is responsible."
"Did he say hit a hospital or mis fire from a hospital?   The phrase ""hit a hospital"" is pretty clear. 

Has Hamas been complying with ""international humanitarian and international law""?  Clearly not so basic grammar proves jt isn't talking about hamas here."
Whilst blaming Trudeau lol.  Mental cartwheels.
"when asked about the IDF bombing a hospital, Justin Trudeau said (in French).  At no point in that press conference did JT or the reporter accuse Hamas or state that IDF might not be responsible.

you can watch the entire press release online.

you are changing the context to protect your leader."
"Shit, my bad man.  Cheers"
"It turns out if you keep killing children’s fathers and mothers, there’s a good chance that some rich “religious” cult will convince them to become terrorists."
"Why can't Egypt help? 

Why doesn't Gaza have clean water? Maybe they shouldn't have turned their pipes into rockets."
Israel supplies something like 11% of Gaza's water. They have a shortage because they literally dig up water pipes to make rockets and commit war crimes.
"By they you mean, Israel and Egypt. Yes. Why didn't their Arabic brother help? Because Egypt doesn't want them either. 

No country would be stupid enough to provide resources to terrorists control territory."
Ah. They’re in prison are they? Would you care to explain how you’ve come to the conclusion that they’re in prison? Or are you just regurgitating everything you’ve heard and using idiotic sound bites to sound more intelligent? You know nothing of the region nor the conflict. Just a 13 year old keyboard warrior who hasn’t had an original thought in their meager and unimportant life.
"How is that different?  It is in their charter they are eliminating the Jews from the land. 

It is just that this time Hama is so incompetent and weak compare to Hitler that they have no means to supply their citizen and have to use their own citizen and civilian infrastructure as human shield to fight their enemy."
"It's literally the same exact thing, and what's offensive is you using your ethnicity as a weapon to defend people who can and will exterminate our entire people if given the chance."
Billions of dollars are donated to Gaza. They have a border with Egypt. Israel has completely pulled out and only has a maritime blockade to limit the amount of rockets and other weapons Hamas is able to smuggle. Of course the population is ever increasing and they have limited food and water and fuel and  electricity and medicine but they sure as hell have no shortage of rockets. There is no Israeli genocide. If anything it's Hamas who are dead set on killing their own people.
"No, that's death..."
I’m against killing of any type
"""Here's some great sources to better understand the situation in Palestine.""

Yes I did indicate that it's sources from the Palestinian perspective.

You not agreeing makes no difference to me. The Palestinian perspective of life the last 60 years is a more reliable source to me than u/sadauntrbn.

As for fake news and propaganda, what? That original tweet wasn't put out and then deleted? All I said was it's sus, which it is. Doesn't prove anything, but it's definitely suspect in my mind.

I'll add that my entire point is that everyone is crying lies from one side or the other. Us arguing on Reddit is meaningless, I can just keep calling your sources fake news and you can keep calling mine fake news. As far as I can tell, Palestine has been occupied by a ruthless regime with no claim to the land for 60 years. Everything else is propaganda intended to buy allegiance from the rest of the world. And only one of the two sides has been oppressed by the other."
"Right, isn’t that what you do when you blindly believe the IOF? The one that has used chemical weapons on civilians in just the past two weeks? The one that has a long history of bombing hospitals, schools, residential neighbourhoods? 

The one that sells weapons to genocidal regimes? Those aren’t the terrorists to you? 

Cool way to say you support the massacre of indigenous civilians bro"
"The IDF? No, I don't trust them to do anything other than to kill civilians. Luckily I don't live in Israel, so I'm not gonna end up with an IDF sniper round mysteriously passing through my head for saying it."
Reread the title of the post. And yes hamas committed mass murder. How is committing mass murder in response helping?
"Who lied? Most likely a translation issue in the immediate aftermath of a horrific event. Witnesses were in complete shock retelling the events. If you see parents tied and burned in the living room and a baby without a head in its crib, you assume it was beheaded. Could very well be it was just shot in the head and being soft, the head just exploded off. Does it really matter? Witnesses were not coroners so nothing is official anyway. If you're getting caught up about a trivial detail as a baby being beheaded you're just trying to shift blame on Jews or detract blame from Hamas. Which is frankly disgusting. There is no reason whatsoever to defend what they did. 

There is a reason we differentiate between first degree murder and manslaughter. Intent is important. They intended to murder women and children. You seem to be more than happy looking the other way."
"If the context here is intention in battle, we can measure both sides intention by the type of target, if israels strike locations had *known* jihadi militants in it it's a valid target according to int' law, the same can't be said for palestinian jihadists who burn/stab/shoot literal babies in person one on one.. edit; or shoot rockets in the general direction of israeli cities & [sometime hit gaza itself like this hospitals parking lot, here are some good factual evidences on the matter](https://twitter.com/AGHamilton29/status/1714561416298914276)"

"when was there a real effort to end the illegal occupation of the West Bank? When was there a real effort to end the open air prison status of Gaza? Israel has only offered continued occupation. the violence will never end until one of two things happens. Israel makes meaning steps towards a genuine two state solution or the Palestinians, like native Americans, are removed from the equation. the radicals in Gaza did not rise to power in a vaccum. Israel literally backed Hamas to destabilize the region. you don’t do that because you want peace."
"Oh, so I guess you are reading ultra left and hamas propoganda? Thanks for informing us. You can side with whoever the fuck you want in this conflict. I’ll side with the guys that fight certified terrorists and whose government is not fully corrupt and doesn’t take all the help funds in their pocket."
"Okay but like it wouldn’t be worthless. It would be treated with skepticism at worst. But also the US’s current actions including pressuring Israel to open humanitarian lines into Southern Gaza would have to be considered too. The US doesn’t care about Palestine. They care about Israel existing, and they know if Israel pushes too hard they become a pariah state. 

I’m not saying you shouldn’t be skeptical of their reports. But when it comes down to it they have a hell of a lot more credibility than Hamas."
Aren't they saying like 500 people dead though? Whatever landed there still had to do something significant to cause so much damage
"Are you serious?

You still think that Hamas is honest and releasing conservative estimates?"

what is this supposed to be?
"he is extreme. and totally new to his job.

Hamas' founding charter literally calls for the destruction of Israel"
"There is a difference between civilian casualties because their terrorist “freedom fighters” hide behind them in residential areas and intentionally raiding villages of civilians with the intent of killing, butchering, raping and kidnapping women, children and elderly.
You Hamas lovers seems to not get the difference in your thick skulls. There is no moral equivalence between the two, not even close.
All those Palestinian civilians would be alive now if Hamas did not commit an act of war and genocide on Oct 7. That’s the reality and you can spin it whichever way you like."
"and how many of those were HamAss terrorists?

how many of those were killed because HamAss was using them as human shields to protect their military assets?"
"Every thing I've said is factual, though."
"He made a statement that was factually accurate at the time.  


You want him to have claimed it was an accident before anyone suggested it was one.  


That's absurd."
"Also, ""The bombing of a hospital"" verbage appears to be from the writer of the article, not Trudeau. Someone asked you for a source, and you posted someone elses words.

Statements from Trudeau like,“Together, we must determine what happened. There must be accountability”, arent condeming Isreal. They're completely neutral.

You're complaining about nothing."

Mississauga mayor and city council will soon announce their withdrawal out of Palestine.
How about we just let that country be and watch from the sidelines for once.... We have enough shit to deal with in our own Country
This comment section is a spicy hot dumpster fire
"The only way this even slows down is if Hamas releases hostages. And that's not going to happen. Most are likely dead or being tortured/raped.

Hamas plans to martyr the entire Gaza population to garner support. Israel can't just do nothing, especially while Hamas is still attacking and firing rockets at them. Their plan is use human shields so Israel is pressured into stopping, which isn't a good ending either."
"Innocent civilians is dying , we and they should urge Hamas to surrender unconditionally right away ."
Funny how they never march or protest against Hamas.
Release the hostages first.
"Dumb question - when I see people claim ""pro palestinian rally"" etc... Are they rallying in support of hamas or the senseless violence and poverty of civilians? Because that's a very different Palestinian rally than one supporting hamas. 

Ditto for pro-israeli rallies - is it supporting the state of people? I really wish headlines would specify up front"
"[Should preface by saying that Rebel News is trash, but just know that yes, some of these pro-Palestinian protesters are also pro-Hamas](https://twitter.com/realmonsanto/status/1713317504812978573)"
"So, uh...we're just gonna ignore the fact that there were demonstrators waving Taliban flags at this ""march""?

I mean if we're going to be fair, I do recall liberals labelling everyone who was at the trucker convoy nazis because there were a couple of people with nazi flags.

Should they not apply the same logic and label everyone at this rally a taliban enthusiast?"
"I am on their side, but… unfortunately Hamas isn’t. There will be peace when the terrorists are eliminated."
[deleted]
Isn’t the violence caused by Hamas? Hamas shouldn’t receive support from Canadians. Hamas uses people as human shields in Gaza. For example. They launch missiles from the top of residential buildings. They block roads to prevent people from escaping northern Gaza. They want people to stay in northern Gaza when the Israeli military invades.
"It’s crazy that a march against war crimes is met with such weird responses. Yes Hamas is a barbaric organization. Do you know what drives support for barbaric situations? Bombing women and children. Absolutely nothing happening in Gaza now is showing those people anything but a sign that Israel will wipe them off this planet. 

It is numerous war crimes being committed currently and a protest against that is pretty obvious. I’m sorry that some people there brought flags or did other signs of support for horrid groups. It doesn’t take away two obvious things for Canadians. Yes we can protest and yes we should stand to show support against people being blown into oblivion"
"Strange how things change in a week. Last weekend they were celebrating the 'glorious' actions by Hamas. This weekend they are lamenting the 'violence' against the people of Gaza the moment Israel struck back.

lol .. maybe they should not have started this round of violence
"This is what Hamas banks on happening. Launch an attack murdering civilians, run and hide behind women and children in Gaza, wait for all the bleeding hearts in the West to start screaming about Palestinian casualties when Israel mounts a response and inevitably hits the human shields that the terrorists are using.

Why is no one blaming HAMAS for what is happening in Gaza right now?"
"Well, they might get an end to the violence, its just that the end might come from a thinly veiled genocide….

God Israel is telegraphing the genocide angle so hard it scares me…"
"This needs to stop. Stop bringing in blatant terrorism supporters parading in Canadian streets. 

I mean this is as bad as protests supporting the Taliban. 
Muslims are essentially showing the world how primitive their thinking is in discerning such political issues. It's just black and white with no nuance. 

You realize Hamas just massacred 1300 Jews, amongst the largest anti semetic event since ww2. The optics are bad.

Good thing I left this horribly petty faiths Nd don't associate with Canadian Muslims

Did you hear the Muslim Association of Canada was funneling donation money to Hamas. Good game guys"
No one condemns Hamas…
"Yes, end of violence is good.

Were any of them calling for surrender of Hamas and release of the hostages?"
we keep seeing parties based on islam fundamentalism get voted in and then all hell breaks loose and they do some jihad stuff and everyone calls the people who voted for them victims. they are only victims of themselves.
"The fact people felt empowered enough to show up here with Taliban flags, had people blocking out cameras running a screen play for them, and were not immediately pulled put of that truck and beaten says all that needs to be said. Hamas is isis."
"Idk.. over the years, I've lost any and all sympathy for Palestinians and the arab/muslim world at large. ""Fool me once...."" and all that, enough is enough. I am not a huge fan of Israel, but in this scenario, more power to them."
Israel is killing civilians by the hundreds now. 2 wrongs don't make a right. But you're not driving sympathy to your cause when you're waving the flags of extremists like the Taliban
The terrorists shouldn’t have started something that they can’t finish. It’s hard to imagine the amount of support that they have here in Canada. What would be nice is for all of these supporters be exposed. Maybe just maybe they’re employers might take action. As a consumer I would like to know if a business I frequent employs terror supporters.
How about the end of violence by the people of Gaza. I think then Israel would have no reason to deal with the situation.
[removed]
They should all go back and have demonstrations in Israel or Palestine
"March against murder of civilians, and all people here can do is pretend every Palestinian is a member of Hammas, ignore the fact that Palestinians are a severely repressed people, and justify Israeli war crimes and collective punishment. It’s disgusting. I can denounce war crimes without supporting Hammas, and I can denounce Israeli imperialism and ethnic cleansing without being antisemetic. 

Imagine a French based terrorist group attacked Israel. Logistics aside, how would the world respond if Israel could and did: shut of food and water and electricity to all of Paris, drop 6000 bombs on Paris, tell half of Paris to move to the other half of Paris in a day, and murder thousands of Parisian's (far more than the initial attack).

The answer is of course that the world would be up in arms, disgusted, and condemning Israeli actions.

But when the civilians are brown, it seems we have all lost our humanity."

"Why don't these marches ask hamas to surrender, considering the fact that they started this crap last weekend."
Israel should have given more time for people to evacuate. But the assault needed to happen

"The biggest step toward ending such violence lies in dismantling these strongholds for Islamist terrorists. 

No nation on earth can have any sort of long term peace where such groups like Al Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah, Al Shabaab, ISIS etc. exist."
"We use to have a game when I was a kid, the idea of which is to kick each other in the nuts until someone says ""I give up, you win"".

Why aren’t their banks accounts getting frozen?

Might want to add these to the terrorsit watch list immediately.
"The easiest way is for the people in Gaza to rebel against Hamas and hand over the terrorists to Israeli forces.

Then no siege, and everyone wins (except Hamas).

But everyone already knows where loyalty of most ppl in Gaza lies."
freedom of speech is what is great for everyone
I'm sure they'll definitely stop because we said so 🙄 idiots.
"What are they expecting to happen? They will look at this march and go “yeah they got us, we give up” like what? Am I being ignorant? I just don’t see what good it’s doing anyone and what they are expecting the outcome of it to be."
I'm pro hamas ☺️😁
It would have been nice to see these same people a week ago marching against violence in Israel.
Holy shit! Canada is DEAD. These people are lying Antisemites and there are thousand of them. This is definitely NOT the Canada I grew up in.
"Gotta ask if anyone else feels the way I do about this.

I just don't fucking care anymore, the whole Israel-Palestine conflict has been going off and on longer than most of us here have been alive and we have big enough problems in **this** country to deal with so why the hell should we waste any more time and effort on people halfway around the world who are never going to change."
Terrorism supporters
Good for those people who were trying to get the Taliban supporters to leave.
Lmao
"So, how many Taliban sympathizers are their in Canada now?  I am amazed there are any to be honest, all these women walking around on their own, must drive them nuts."
"So? They told them to leave. That’s literally all you gotta do when someone shows up to your rally with a terrorist flag if you don’t want to be associated 

Take notes, convoy people"
"So that means they're all Taliban, right?"
"That's what you get for not bringing enough for the entire class.

C'mon, we learned this at age six."
"So, you're implying that they're all terrorists now?"
But but those Nazis weren’t with us!
They should be identified and deported. Fuck those guys.
"No idea who they were, either. Could have been any random people trying to subvert the march."
This is the absolute correct response. If somome shows up with a nazi flag and isn't asked to leave you at a nazi rally
It's one truck with 2 dudes. They seemed peaceful and others were telling them to put it away.
Peace in the GTA!

"Well, because this *is* becoming Canada’s problem, much the same as how Canada is now getting dragged into India’s problems. That’s the “mosaic” identity that Canada has boasted about for forever.

“Hamas is not a terrorist group” a woman in Mississauga, a city in a country that has designated Hamas as a terrorist group, repeats three times, while wearing AK-47 earrings. “Everything they do is justified… Every single thing they have done is justified,” she says.

To people like her everything is justified because Israel is a “settler-colonial state” that needs to be “decolonized.” I guess it’s a good thing she’s in a country that isn’t considered by a growing number of people to be one of these so-called “settler-colonial states…” oh, wait:

“…these events serve as a reminder that resistance against colonial violence is justified and necessary. This is ""decolonization"" and ""land-back"" actualized as we continue to see the Palestinian people stand firm in their resistance against their oppressors.”

“Settler-colonial states like so-called Canada and their institutions continue to legitimize their existence and those of other settler-colonial states making them complicit in the ongoing genocide.”

The same argument from people at a Canadian institution in “so-called Canada.”

This event has put a spotlight on something that needs to be taken more seriously in Canada and other countries."
That's r/canada for you lol. Lots of nationalism and xenophobia on this sub
Always is. That rCanada bay beee
"I agree.

Irrespective of all the whataboutism above in this thread, wouldn't the absolute fastest way to deescalate this situation be releasing just 137 people (Hamas claims 13 already died) to ensure the 2,300,000 people of Gaza get vital food, water, medicine and aid ? The fact they haven't released even a small subset of them yet, like the children, speaks volumes.

Israel has called Hamas' bluff on executing the hostages and I'm guessing they have no plan whatsoever at this point except to let their people die."
"Ya for all Israel's faults, hamas has put them in a really bad situation here. There just aren't any good options."
"Ah yes. The only way for Israel to stop committing war crimes against civilians is if an undemocratic, terrorist group performs a certain action. That kind of black and white thinking is just a thinly veiled excuse for Israeli war crimes"

fuck off with this shit. this is not a one sided affair."
But first let’s urge Israel to stop their land theft and the persecution and murdering of Palestinians! And urge Americans to stop sending money from financing building walls and military.

You can't surrender to revenge and retribution. This is why everyone calling for more violence has a garbage take.
"Well it's not like Israel can sit idly by while Hamas continues attacks, tortures hostages, and launches rockets.

Funny Zionists never protest against Israeli atrocities.
Because our government can't pressure Hamas. But they can take a stance against Israel and US's unconditional support
Bit like how pro Israel folks never protest against idf war crimes or Israeli apartheid.
"Funny how ""they"" never protest against apartheid and 50+ years of occupation."
Funny how people equate Hamas with civilian Palestinians who had nothing to do with any of this
"What would the point be? Even if they somehow managed to replace Hamas, Gaza would still be under a blockade and Palestine would still be subject to occupation."
funny how you never march either.
"End the cycle of violence (now that all the Jew killing we can get away with for the time being is completed)!

Friendly reminder that the number of Palestinians killed by IDF strikes on Gaza this week if somehow Hamas had been able to avoid slaughtering over *twelve hundred* innocent men, women and children would have been zero.

We are now seeing credible reports that Hamas is preventing Palestinian civilians from going to south Gaza, as always because they wish to maximize civilian casualties for propaganda purposes."
"Funny how ""they"" never protest against the mass starvation of Palestinian civilians."
"I would love to see you apply the same logic to Israel.  
 
 Even when IDF were sniping unarmed children and were proud about it (even bragging about their precision, and how they knew where every bullet went), motherfuckers like you would immediately scream ""condemn Hamas"" to anyone talking about it.  Lookup the ""March of return"" of 2018 for a great example of unarmed children, pregnant women, journalists and medics getting sniped. Even during those events, the first thing every brown people get asked when they are interviewed about it is ""do you condemn hamas actions?"". No one ever asks the israel side if they condemn the snipping of unarmed children."
"Because hamas hasnt dropped 6000 bombs, included illegal phosphorous bombs, on a civilian population with water and electricity cut off.

And to make it totally clear, because people like you like to push a red heron narrative, the protests are in support of PALESTINIANS going through a genocide at the hands of israel, not for hamas."
[deleted]
You know the Israeli military has been arresting minors for no reason and Israel has wayyyyyyyy more hostages than Hamas?
"I can almost guarantee that the rallies themselves are not pro terrorism and the media is just on its typical outrage cycle. If there were people out there actually chanting in support of terrorism or being anti-semitic you know they'd have the video everywhere.

I say this in part because years ago I popped by a Palestine rally (I live in Ottawa and walk by a lot of protests, I walked through the convoy too to see what was up even though I disagreed) and there were a bunch of Orthodox Jewish people, the speakers called Jewish people their brothers and sisters and said that Israelis are not the enemies, and that was as bombs fell on Gaza so I don't see what would be different now other than the clickbait outrage stuff being even more of an issue in the media.

It goes both ways too, I never met an Israeli in real life who wouldn't be shocked and sickened by some of the things their self appointed ""allies"" say in ""support"". You think the average Israeli is going to feel good seeing random Canadians say that their government should kill 3 million people indiscriminately? These are all people, most of them probably don't like violence or war, as much as the media wants this conflict to define both sides. Acting like Israelis support the actions of the IDF uncritically and acting like all Gazans support Hamas killing civilians are armchair AF and it's interesting that a lot of people do both."
Palestinian rallies held here are almost never pro Hamas. I'm not saying they can't happen but I've never personally seen it. They're usually in solidarity for the people of Palestine asking for an end to Israeli hostilities and occupation. Protestors just want the same freedom and rights for Palestinians as Israel has.
i mean this headline is pretty clear dude
I would never understand why a woman would defend a Muslim terrorist group especially after she has experienced the rights and freedom as a woman in a country like Canada.
"I'm conservative and many years ago I had to stop watching any of their content. (At the beginning there were some good hosts.) If I wanted to have a Canadian parody of biased American conservative commentary, it would be hard not to plagiarize Rebel Media."
Did they call them out and ask them to leave?
Funny also because the guy with the nazi flag at the convoy protest was an Arab. He was arrested.
Logic is a construct of the patriarchal colonizer world view and must be abolished….  or something.
[deleted]
So uh are we just going to ignore thst the Palestinian protesters forced those Taliban supporters to leave?
Again why would you condemn thousands of people for the acts of one or two people. They were asked to leave.
No there won’t! What a thing to say! Do you not understand how colonialism and occupation work? The people of a Palestine are not under occupation because of Hamas. Isreal holds power to end the occupation.
"That's why they're doing it, we know how that ends now"
It would be too late to protest after the US nuked them.
No hamas didn't start this conflict. The violence started like 75 years ago mate. Hamas didn't even exist back then...this conflict is not new. It's the result of decades of occupation that has been going on till today.
"Because last week they were cheering for the deaths of over a thousand innocent lives. Fuck these people. They want all Jews dead. Them changing the message doesn't change what their message was last week. This is the expected response from Isreal. Everyone in the entire world would expect Isreal to retailiate after a terrorist attack. We don't like it? Tough shit. They either put an end to it now or die later. That's the choice they have. Palestinians elected these fucks. It's the will of the people. This is what the people chose, this is what they get."
"Or poverty. They always bring up poverty.

They clearly forget Osama bin Laden was born with a golden spoon."
Why are you not blaming Israel for creating Hamas?
Because Gaza is an occupied  territory. The onus should never be on the oppressed to end violence. Isreal holds all the power in this situation.
"It honestly feels a bit like after 9/11 where something undeniably horrible and tragic happened then everyone went absolutely bonkers in response, and before we knew it an unrelated country was in ruins and our privacy rights disappeared forever. People are acting like that with all the casual talk of annhialating Gaza and deporting Canadian citizens for wrongthink and thinkpieces about outlawing protests.

I guess it's a break from arguing about pronouns."

Pretty much everyone condemns Hamas. Feel free to start a protest!
Do you protest for what you believe in or what you don’t believe in? This is why there is no specific protest against Hamas. Protests are about what you believe in and nobody supports Hamas here
"Those radicals rose to power in 2005. Through an “election”. But you have to understand the situation of people “voting” and what options they had during the election (if any at all).

2005. That’s 18 (eighteen) YEARS ago.

Currently 50% (fifty percent meaning HALF) the population of Gaza is under 18 years old.  You think this half of Gazan HUMANS _asked_ to be ruled by this group in this time and age (they all have social media and do see the world outside their prison)? Or have much of a choice?

They grew up in a blockade. And are now being bombarded.  Logically speaking if I was in the shoes of any young Gazan— and seeing the world SILENT or even SUPPORTIVE of my own genocide… I _might_ just start believing those radicals ruling over me? “This is why we need to fight back— look how they treat you” No?

It’s a sad situation.  What a shame that we have become desensitized by media to this degree...

Pray for peace. ☮️"
"The last election was 20 years ago and half the population is under 20. 

At least try and educate yourself."
The people who waved that flag were asked to leave though.
Instead they’re trying to do it by labelling anyone who doesn’t cheer on their genocide as anti semetic
How about the end of violence in the west Bank by Israeli settlers where there are no Hamas. They're shooting Palestinians on the streets.
"> violence by the people of Gaza

Half the people of Gaza are children, and the vast majority of them did not commit the atrocities for which they are now being collectively punished."
"Of course Israel doesn't want to deal with the situation.

The Palestinians in Gaza Strip are refugees and their descendants that fled, or were forced from their homes by Zionists in 1948. Their property was confiscated and they weren't allowed to return.

They've lived in Gaza Strip refugee camps for generations since. Israel is perfectly happy them staying there till the end of time.

>Most people in the Gaza Strip are descendants of refugees who fled or were expelled from the area that became Israel after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip

>In 1948, more than 700,000 Palestinian Arabs – about half of prewar Palestine's Arab population – fled from their homes or were expelled by Zionist militias

>between 400 and 600 Palestinian villages were destroyed, village wells were poisoned in a biological warfare programme and properties were looted to prevent Palestinian refugees from returning, and other sites subject to Hebraization of Palestinian place names

>Later, a series of laws passed by the first Israeli government prevented Arabs who had left from returning to their homes or claiming their property. They and many of their descendants remain refugees. The expulsion of the Palestinians has since been described by some historians as ethnic cleansing, while others dispute this charge. Nevertheless, the existence of the so-called Law of Return allowing for immigration and naturalization of any Jewish person and their family to Israel, while a Palestinian right of return has been denied, has been cited as an evidence for the charges of Apartheid against the State of Israel.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion_and_flight

I kinda can't get over the [poisoned wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitic_trope#Well_poisoning)...."
tell me you don't understand the Israeli Palestinian conflict without telling me you don't understand the Israeli Palestinian conflict
Yup. Israel needs Hamas.
"Yeah no, last week they were cheering for the murder, rape, and abduction of hundreds of people. Hamasaki is the will of the people. It's there elected representatives that just decided to go to war by conducting terrorist attacks. Of course Isreals going to retaliate and only an idiot would think they wouldn't fuck a lot of shit up. They warned the people as well, Hamas told the people to stay so they can die and be used as propaganda. No other Middle Eastern country wants these people because they are simply just not nice people on a collective level. It's been generations like this."
">I can denounce war crimes without supporting Hammas

But why dont people at these protests ever denounce Hamas?"
"Israel isn't removing terrorists, they are indiscriminately killing civilians and applying collective punishment to all of Palestine. Both war crimes."
Are you seriously asking why they aren’t supporting the state that is bombing Palestinian women and children?
Isn’t it because Israel has been terrorizing Palestine for 75 years? That would be like asking the Indigenous peoples of Canada to protest in support of the government that carried out residential school
"Good point, why aren't the civilians more open to working with the nation state that has turned off the electricity/water supply while continuously bombing them (and the humanitarian aid groups helping them) and killing international journalists that just want to tell the story of what's going on in Gaza."
read a book
The Israel and Palestine conflict didn't just start last weekend...
Doesn’t matter how much time they give them. Hamas has been setting up roadblocks to prevent evacuation. As well as forcing people at gunpoint back into buildings that will be bombed. They’re intentionally maximizing their own civilian casualties.
Palestine is about half children. Tell me why they all needed to die?
"I mean they’re bombing the people who are evacuating so it makes no difference.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67114281

Their intentions are clear and the rest of the world governments are watching without a word."
Probably not the blockade to starve millions of civilians right? That's genocide. Are you defending that too?
Why do you think the assault needed to happen?
Oh look another “this started last Saturday” take..
"Imagine a French based terrorist group attacked Israel. Logistics aside, how would the world respond if Israel could and did: shut of food and water and electricity to all of Paris, drop 6000 bombs on Paris, tell half of Paris to move to the other half of Paris in a day, and murder thousands of Parisian's (far more than the initial attack). 

The answer is of course that the world would be up in arms, disgusted, and condemning Israeli actions. 

But when the civilians are brown, it seems we have all lost our humanity."
HAMAs is a terrorist group. What makes you think they can be handed over?
Agreed.  This is the appropriate response when this sort shows up.

How do we even have *supporters* of the Taliban in our country?
"Do you know how many 1945 Nazis both the US and Canada brought over, knowing they were Nazis? Because it's A LOT more than you think it is."
"Honestly, I wouldnt be surprised if they did this deliberately.

They’d have to have an idea people would be angry about it."
"Are they Taliban sympathizers or are they trying to discredit the protest. 

That's an important question."
"And showing their hair and ankles. Must be hard for them to swallow. 

Maybe then they will have a heart attack for everyone’s sake."
[removed]
"Well, we can now say that they ""stand with people who wave Taliban flags""."
[removed]
His link text says they asked them to leave... The hell you think he's implying
"Well, aren’t all truckers Nazis because of one flag?"
All of the Taliban?
Hamas and Taliban supporters? Yes.
"From the Credit River to the Lake,  

Supporting Hamas is a big mistake."
Even a dead clock is right at least once a day.
"That's exactly why they do it. Virtue signalling to a certain voter base about something they have absolutely no ability to influence. It could be Palestine or any of a million other political footballs, it's just about optics."
"Xenophobia is bad, sure, but since when did nationalism start to be bad?"
"Can you give me a definition of nationalism please? I'd say the nationalism is coming from pro Bill-C11 people, aka liberals, at this point."
"They called that bluff hard.  I think Israel is prepared to let those people be sacrifices, not only because if those folks die then Hamas no longer has a bargaining chip in the hostage department, but also because it's not just Israelis that are hostages. Theres folks from all over being held hostage. Hamas starts executing American citizens, I don't think the US is going to sit around and watch for very long.  It's terrible to put it this way, but it's somewhat of a win-win for Israel. Either they don't kill the hostages and they get released, or they do and not only does Hamas not have them to use to bargain, but it will definitely lower the already waning support for Hamas and potentially bring other powers into the war, and at the very least increase support for Israel."
The plan is clearly to get as many of them killed as possible in order to have as many bodies as possible to “prove” the Israelis are genocidal monsters.
"> to ensure the 2,300,000 people of Gaza get vital food, water, medicine and aid ?

There was insufficient food and water two weeks ago, when no hostages were held."
"Exactly. ""Free palestine"" and what? Give Hamas the ability to enslave all the children and make an army of child soldiers. Palestine has no structure. They wouldnt be able to form a nation. The nation is primarily kids they can't support.

Honestly the only way it's resolved is if neighboring countries took in the refugees. But thats not going to happen."
"So, Israel is just supposed to ignore the attack and rockets flying at them?"
Hamas has embedded themselves within the civilian population. The civilian population is aware of and allows this. This isn’t collateral damage. The civilian population is complicit. If Palestinians wanted peace they would do something about Hamas. They have been offered statehood no less than 4 times in recent history. They don’t want peace they want Israel Obliterated..
"Or they could, for instance stop blockading Gaza.  Remember half of Gaza are children (under 18) and Israel has been blockading them for 18 years restricting food, water, medicine, electricity basically in response to an election.

While they may have to respond to Hamas provocations like rockets and attacks on civilian, the blockade decision was all theirs."
"Educated on Social Media University.
Garbage in, garbage out."
These comparisons make absolutely no sense.
"Did Ukraine attack Russia and cause1000+ civilians died?
Did Brits attack nazi germnay and cause1000+ civilians died?"
It's just Marvel comics logic all the way.
"This is quite possibly the lowest IQ opinion I have seen on Reddit (and that is saying something). You gave a bunch of black and white examples for what used to be a grey situation.

The moment of course Hamas beheaded 40 babies in a single day you lost every ounce of legitimacy. But please tell me what the Ukrainians did to the poor Russians before they were invaded (I am laughing my ass off at you right now)"
"I read your comment and realized as it continued you weren't condemning the terrorist attacks and comparing Hamas to Russian aggression, you were actually condemning the music festivals dancers and in your comparison having the children and women that were murdered by terrorists as the Nazis. Jesus Christ our country has some bad immigration."
"Let me understand, you're against a terrorist organization surrender? You think they should keep fighting?"
Settlements of which are also illegal by international law. Heck they're even illegal by Israel's own policies yet they do it. Evil terrorist state.
"Yea, they were offered the two state solution, but Hamas wasn't interested and responded with attacking Israel.

[Palestine received 100 million euros from the EU to build watermains, and Hamas turned them into rockets to attack Israel.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/10/10/eu-funded-water-pipelines-hamas-rockets/)

Unfortunately Hamas' stated end goal is Jewish genocide, not shared land."
"I dont understand how anybody can support Ukraine and not Palestine or Palestine and not Ukraine.

Putin and Netanyahu are both using the pretense of a far right terror group to justify Lebensraum invasions and attacking civilians.

The only difference is that we don't have contractual obligations to Putins regime like we do with Netanyahu, so western countries are trying not to shake the boat thinking Netanyahu might temper his response. 

He won't."
I mean. They did. Multiple intelligence agencies have confirmed they were given a warning of it happening. But they didn't really do anything to increase border security.
"> But thats not a good ending either.

It isn't?  Are you suggesting that it's a good thing that Israel is punishing Palestinians for crimes they did not commit?"
"Is there any real evidence that they are torturing hostages? I saw that the beheaded babies thing ended up not being true, so I'm trying to be more careful with what I believe"
"This doesn't make it reasonable to indiscriminately kill Palestinians. A lot of people lately look to Hamas' popularity as some kind of blank check for murder. 

But I haven't seen anybody asking themselves what their lives would be like had they grown up in Gaza. For as long as you can remember you are taught to hate Israel, you are denied any kind of sovereignty as a people, and you have friends, family and others who die often due to poverty that certainly feels like it's being forced on you by Israel. If you don't know anybody personally, certainly you've heard stories of so and so, killed by the IDF. 

Of course Hamas is popular. The hatred runs *deep*. These kids never had a chance to learn anything else. If you were born in Gaza, or I was born in Gaza, we'd probably support Hamas as well. 

That doesn't excuse the massacres that happened, but you can't create a perfect breeding ground for hate and extremism, and then when those people develop hateful and extremist ideology use it to justify killing them. You've set them up for this failure. 

I don't know how to fix something like this, but the mass murder of these people, especially the 50% who are still literal children, doesn't feel like a way out. It feels sickening, and I refuse to try and justify it by saying ""well, Hamas is pretty popular so they have it coming"""
"The median age there is 18 years old..

That’s a pathetic excuse to absolve Israel from bombing kids"
"I'm sure it's tough to resist supporting terrorists when your home is getting bombed and your friends and family are getting killed. However, they (Palestinians) are still civilians at the end of the day and deserve to be safe."
"Many, but not the majority. And the Gaza strip isn't a democracy, elections haven't been held since 2006, and they were corrupt and fraudulent. Median age in Gaza is around 19, so a large portion of people in Gaza weren't alive or able to vote the last time an election was held."
"Less than a third of Palestinians support Hamas. 

> A little over a quarter (27%) believe that Hamas is the most deserving of representing and leading the Palestinian people today 

https://pcpsr.org/en/node/955"
There's a large portion of Jews who openly condemn violence against Palestine and how they are treated.
Hamas needs to be destroyed
Do you honestly think if Joly tried to pressure Israel about anything she wouldn’t be laughed out of the room?
Killing babies. That's quite a unique stance you guys got there.
Canada Can pressure Qatar and Turkey which provide money and safe haven to HamAss.
"More than half of Palestinians support Hamas (as per recent polls) and they elected Hamas to represent them in their last election. 

Now, of course there is the other half of Palestinians that don’t support Hamas and it’s probable that a portion of the other half that do support Hamas are doing so under duress. Also, their last election was over a decade ago. 

But to claim that Hamas and Palestine aren’t connected in any way is an ignorant take that will produce no long term solutions. Open your eyes."
It is so telling when people say that they elected Hamas so they all deserve to be bombed... Ignoring that if we had the same level of 'democracy' as Gaza Stephen Harper would be on year 16 of his first term.   Like say what you will and Hamas are obviously BAD NEWS but twisting the facts like that to justify hating average Palestinians is silly.
"If Hamas was gone and there were no terror concerns the blockade on both sides (Egypt and Israel) would be gone. The blockade is there specifically to prevent Hamas from getting weapons. It isn't just Israel putting up a blockade. Egypt knows what they're dealing with in Hamas.

Israel left Gaza in 2005 as well so if Hamas is gone things would certainly be a lot better for the Palestinians."
"The blockade was created because hosts of terrorists were coming from Gaza and blowing up buses of civilians, including school children. As much as some people like to think that Israel just wants to do bad things to Palestinians, to Israel, it's the matter of national security. I don't have an answer for this, but when you're next to a hostile community whose members will find every opportunity to kill you, you must protect yourself."
"It would just turn into ISIS controlled Iraq, or what Iran is today. Is that an outcome you prefer?"
I don’t hate anyone enough to March.
[I wonder how many protestors share this woman's views](https://twitter.com/realmonsanto/status/1713317504812978573)
Hamas has fired thousands of ~~bombs~~ rockets. They have just mostly been stopped by the iron dome.
">Because hamas hasnt dropped 6000 bombs, included illegal phosphorous bombs, on a civilian population with water and electricity cut off.

Hamas has murdered over 1,000 civilians in its most recent attack. 

They didn't drop 6,000 bombs, but they have launched tens of thousands of rockets indiscriminately towards Israel. 

They didn't cut off water and electricity, but they sure found the time to cut off the heads of civilians in Israel."
"Hamas has launched over 8500 rockets at Israel so far, what on earth are you talking about"
"Ummm, you realize that Hamas is the elected government in Gaza right?"
How many hostages does Egypt have?
They arent anti-Hamas though
"Because, in the event that there does become a Palestinian state, she will mysteriously still choose to live here instead.  She earns street cred spouting this shit.  She believes in nothing.  

It's interesting, though, because she is pretty much purely using Islam as an aesthetic and adopts none of its values.  I wish I could understand the somnambulist attitude that these people take.  They're not ever thinking about what they're saying.  Weird animals, we Homo Sapiens."

I recall videos of people telling the nazis to fuck off and grabbing their flags from them.
"Lmfao no, we all saw the videos, stop gaslighting. There were hundreds of protesters, and about 6 people tried telling them to leave, and they didn't. So what, 6 people out of several hundred actually had a problem with it?

Meanwhile there were multiple instances of dozens of people shunning people trying to sneak nazi propaganda into the freedom convoy protests, and no one ever gave those people any credit. ""Everyone in the freedom convoy was a nazi"" according to the media.

Get out of here with that bullshit."
"So were the people with nazi materials lmfao. Like holy fucking hell, this isn't hard to figure out. It's 100% pure hypocrisy. 

Also, the videos showed only about 6 people out of several hundred who were in attendance actually having a problem with it and putting forth a weak effort to try and get them to leave."
[deleted]
And why can’t people escape from Gaza to Egypt? Because Hamas is blocking them.
Different people mate. Not all brown people are the same. I didn't support killings that occurred a week ago. I support ending the siege and occupation of Palestine though.
">Palestinians elected these fucks. It's the will of the people 
 

Half the population of gaza right now was not even born when the last election took place.   
 
The other thing to consider is that not only did Israel actively worked to put hamas in power but they made sure Hamas would maintain power over time. netanyahu himself worked on this.
 
 
Here is a fun quote from them in 2019: [*Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas,” Netanyahu told his Likud party’s Knesset members in March 2019. “This is part of our strategy*](https://twitter.com/haaretzcom/status/1711329340804186619). If you want more details on this, it is well documented and has been considered a fact  by historians for a long time. They do it intentionally so that people like you would jump on the ""Palestinians are all animals/terrorist"" bandwagon and help justify their war crimes"

"So they all support Hamas and agree with the Hamas’ agenda, eh?"
And I cry for them and curse thier parents who created this situation.
"1948? You mean the war where they Arab League rejected the proposed two-state solution and instead decided to try to wipe Israel off the map completely, only for the aggressors to be decisively defeated and lose their own territory to the much smaller, nascent country? That 1948?

Gaza wasn't even under Israeli control after that, but still in Egyptian hands, who themselves severely oppressed the Palestinian population, the whole time Gaza being used as a proxy state to further Egyptian political goals. It wasn't until '67 in yet another outnumbered war, surrounded by hostile neighbors that Israel finally seized Gaza (and the Sinai, only to give it back) in response.

It's like crying about the Nazis losing the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia when the Allies pushed them back to their own borders.

Sure, sucks to be one of the little people caught up in a war and lose your home, but the reality of it was far different than what your post implies."
I think you just confirmed you are a Terrorist supporter.
"Germany: Israel is our reason of state.
Israel: Hamas is our reason of state."
"You leave Hamasaki out of this, he isn't even from the Middle East!"
"Ok don't support Isreal but atleast condem hamas, non of these protestors are calling out hamas for what they did and what they have brought upon gaza."
They sure escalated it to the point of no return though. Hamas doesn't give a crap about Palestinians.
So then just bomb then still? Seems odd to me. It’s like hostages are being used as a shield and you still shoot everyone. 🤷
And Israel is targeting ambulances/medics
Because Hamas wants the publicity.
"Israel didn't do that.

You can see from the video online also there is no crater its not an airstrike."
Nothing in that article says Israel is responsible
"Would this French terrorist group also run the country? Would they have taken hostages back to France to torture and execute them, refusing to release them?"
"You at least show you make an effort to catch these terrorists.

But no, people in Gaza are actively sheltering these terrorists and hailing them as heroes."
I’m still sad they’d even be here. It’s hard to swallow that we have brought people here into this country that support terrorism.
"It's the left in this country who support Hamas, not the right.  Just look at the anti Semitic statements made by ONP MPP Sarah Jama."
"We had quite a few before the war too, they held massive rallies in the US and were very close to getting a fascist elected in the UK. No doubt Canada had its fair share as well."
How many Nazi rallies did they organize?
Don’t tell him about the nazi scientists we “rescued”
umm Canada didn't bring them over that was the usa with the scientist for the missile/ space program.
Do you have any sources to back that up or is this just some cockamamie internet theory?
"Big deal, if you didn't swear loyalty to the party and sign off of them they sidelined you, imprisoned you or shot you."
"This was my first thought too. It seems a bit odd, I've never seen a Taliban flag anywhere in Canada before this, or heard anyone in Canada give any support whatsoever to the Taliban. I'm not saying that means they don't exist, but the timing seems suspect."
"Organizer Pat King had over 37 videos promoting antisemitic conspiracies as well as the White replacement conspiracy.

Press X to doubt
"Only after the press got word of it. 

Be real. He was there all day"
"Yeah, it wasn't required.  Most identified themselves as Nazis with their rhetoric."
And all the explicitly fascist and racist slogans they cheered and wrote on their signs? When did they disappear?
No one should be flying a nazi flag in any sort of context but apparently they were trying to say the de facto Liberal/NDP collation are behaving like nazis.
There's no evidence that person was booted out.
They literally told them to leave.
"Seems you don't understand the reference. Glad you were quick on the insult, rather weak one though."
As well as all our MPs who applauded.
"The truckers didn’t make the Nazis or confederates leave, is the difference"
If you don't know the difference between showing solidarity with the Palestinian people and supporting Hamas you should just simply not involve yourself in any discussions pertaining to this situation. Ignorance is bliss.
Google: the good and bad of nationalism
"Hamas trying to imitate ISIS/ISIL/Daesh last weekend opened the world's eyes.

>“From this moment on, we announce that any targeting of innocent civilians without warning will be met, regretfully to say, by executing one of the hostages in our custody,” Ubaida said, adding, “Our enemy does not understand the values or ethics.”

I find the last line particularly ironic coming from a terrorist organization.

We aren't aware of any executions yet but if they were stupid enough to do it on film (again), they will lose most of the sympathy they've regained this week."
"I doubt any of those hostages are still alive, and I'm sure Israel probably thinks they're already dead by now too."

"Unfortunately the neighboring countries have had some bad experiences with the Palestinian refugees. In almost every country they've been taken in they've tried to overthrow the government, in Jordan they tried to asassinate the king, contributed to Lebanon's civil war, cheered when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait."
"those are ""peace rockets""  that explode with love and friendship."
"NO, they should hunt down the people who did it and kill them like dogs. But not kill thousands of innocent civilians that did nothing wrong."
"Israel has already murdered more civilians than Hammas did in the attack, by their OWN count. The true number is likely far far higher"
"> Did Brits attack nazi germnay and cause1000+ civilians died?

Um, yes?  Eventually.  Did you miss that history lesson?"
"Ukraine said that they are joining NATO, so Russia attacked."
What if the settlements are bad **and** Hamas terrorist attacks are bad?
"actually when the British were setting up the initial land agreement with Palestinians Zionist terrorists didn’t like the terms, even though moderate arabs were open to them, and bombed buildings in Palestine.."
"Did Ukrainians invade Russia and raped, butchered and kidnapped Russians before the war?"
I wouldn't consider leaving behind the hostages and ignoring Hamas's continuing attacks a good ending. If you reward terrorism whats the point.
There were literally pictures on reddit of the beheaded babies (also burnt babies)
What do you think Israel should have done in response to the attack?
"They don't even have a choice. There's no elections that have been held in 16 years. Hamas doesn't even control the whole country. In the end even in a free Palestine scenario, the country is actually still incredibly divided. There really is no easy way to solve the scenario which is why it's constant and will likely be constant forever."
[removed]
"Israel’s been bombing kids since before the attack, in the thousands. In 2018, 31,000 people were injured by Israel through direct conflict. If most people are under 18 years old, would it stand to reason that Israel injured 15,500 children on average? The flip side 130 Israelis were injured that year due to direct conflict with Palestinians.

Nobody should be using children in war, for anything but it still sucks that thousands are in this situation, and are getting hurt."
Israel should not respond to terror because Hamas hides among children?
"It is up to the HamAss government to ensure the safety of their populace, perhaps by not starting another war they will lose.

Governments make decisions all the time that affect their populace. HamAss had planned and started a war. HamAss likes to use their people as human shields. HamAss likes to destroy infrastructure, infrastructure that was used to provide water, so they can make rockets. 

HamAss', poor decisions, and their callousness towards life, are decisions that are supported by a large chunk of the civilian population. HamAss decision do not obligate Israel."
"Oh of course i didnt mean to detract the Jewish people who bravely speak out against the treatment in Palestine. Just questioning why most muslim populations dont march against Hamas is the equivalent of questioning why most Zionists (which of course does not compromise all Jewish people) dont march against the Israeli government. Also you will see more protests against Israeli action in the west because almost all our leaders support Israel action, not Hamas."

Countries absolutely are trying to urge at least some restraint. It isn't binary.
Joly is useless......no other country would take her seriously as one of Trudeaus puppet ministers.
"No, but if more and more western countries did it might have a difference."
As long as Israel has full us support nothing is gonna bother them. We don’t have a seat at that table.

Do they laugh at her when Canada sends them aid?
So I can't be against both killing babies and Israel's actions that effectively derail the chances of a peace settlement?
Spoilers: a ton of babies have and are going to die in Gaza in the coming months.
"That's cute you made a brand new Reddit account to post that false equivalency.

"How the fuck does a brutal, oppressive terrorist organization conduct honest polls without ending up murdering a fuck load of people?

They haven't had an election in decades..."
"Imagine being dumb enough to believe this crap much less post it..


Let me guess, Hamas is also the reason Israel continues to encroach on land too right?"
Another terror group would likely emerge like ISIS or turn into a state like Iran. We are FAR past the point of a good solution that would help both sides.
lol
"See this argument is so flawed because the Palestinians in Gaza see what happens to the Palestinians in the West Bank. They are under a harsh occupation. They have their homes and land stolen, their mosques are raided, and they are murdered with impunity. 

Palestinians in the West Bank aren’t launching rockets and yet they still suffer."
"> The blockade was created because hosts of terrorists were coming from Gaza 

If you starve two million people (including one million children) in an open-air prison, you're going to get some kind of violence at some point. People never take that lying down, it's just not in human nature.

Doesn't matter what label gets used for the violence, doesn't matter which political factions are dominant, doesn't matter what ideology the population holds, doesn't matter what colour their skin is. Violence is simply inevitable.

>when you're next to a hostile community whose members will find every opportunity to kill you, you must protect yourself.

The motto of every colonialist and slaver in history."
"Every human rights organization in the world including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Red Cross, and the UN Human Rights Office are united in saying the pathway to peace is for Israel to end apartheid, and end its illegal occupations.

When Hamas attacks the IDF it is literally legal in international law because Palestine is under occupation (obviously it's illegal when they attack civilians, as it is when Israel does so).

Israel isn't acting in self-defense, it is violently colonizing Palestinian territory and forcing Palestinians to live under apartheid.

This is how the UN Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner said it [last week](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/10/commission-inquiry-collecting-evidence-war-crimes-committed-all-sides-israel):

>The Commission is deeply distressed by the mounting violence, and spiralling death toll and underscores the urgency for the parties involved to cease all forms of violence and ensure that civilians are protected.  
The Commission urges Israeli security forces and Palestinian armed groups to adhere strictly to international humanitarian law and international human rights law.  
The Commission also calls for the unconditional and safe release of all individuals who have been taken hostage by Palestinian armed groups.

**In line with its previous findings, the Commission emphasises that the only path towards ending violence and achieving sustainable peace is through addressing the root causes of the conflict including through ending the illegal occupation of Palestinian territory and recognising the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.**"
I'm not surprised you can't think of a reason to march other than hate.
I wonder why she isn't in Palestine helping Hamas then.
"Don’t forget: Hamas steals resources from the people of Gaza to build those rockets. 

They build tunnels underneath the feet of Palestinians, using money and materials that were meant to help Palestinians rebuild. 

You can’t help the civilians without helping Hamas. You can’t get to Hamas without going through civilians. This is very much on purpose."
"By digging up water pipes tp use for rockets to attack israel, I think we could say HamAss did cutoff water to some areas of Gaza."
They haven't had elections since 2006. Such a stupid ass argument
Do you mean Israel?
"Or maybe, and try this through for a second, she was DISPLACED AND KICKED OUT OF HER HOMELAND.

And Hamas is the only group fighting Israel in the name of Palestinians. Why? Because Israel supported them to replace the SECULAR PLO that was the default resistance and leadership of Palestinians until Israel killed Yasser Arafat."
I was referring to that. Rallies bring out all sort of radicals. The response by the majority is very telling.
I’m curious what the lady with the umbrella was trying to do by covering up the altercation with the umbrella
"Why is that woman clearly, purposefully trying to block the cameras view?"
"Shhhh don't show that, it'll mess with the narrative they're trying to push. 

It's the oldest trick in the book and I'm baffled by people who are falling for it constantly. Send someone with shitty symbols, film it, publish it on social media and news, ""OMG LOOK!""."
This exactly. This truth is too much to handle by cowards with shitty hypocritical agendas unfortunately.
"You're right, we should drop 2 nukes on all developing countries and turn them into wealthy westernized countries! Who knew we had the solution this whole time"
The occupation of Gaza by Hamas? Or are we ok with that occupation?
"Yeah no shit. Isreal helped fund a religious based organization in the hopes that they would be friendly towards Isreal and counter the current government at the time who was not. Pretty fucking good thing to do for someone who doesn't like you eh? Yes, they sure regret that decision.

Also, that's how humanity has been rolling for the last 100 years of exponential human growth. There (should be) a majority of the population who are young. Who do you think taught these kids to hate jews and Isreal? The same people who voted for a terrorist organization to represent them."
LOL complete ignorance. It's Israeli occupied territory.
"You’ll notice how I didn’t say *everyone*. Overall, most people know what hamas did was deplorable. What Isreal does is also deplorable. We know how these terrorist groups come to fruition, and it’s after years of your people being oppressed/murdered. People will begin to resist. It’s all awful."
"lol no they support human rights and the right for Palestinians to have equal access to roads, schools, homes, careers"
Will you curse the Israelis who also caused it?
"What exactly is your argument. You're not laying out any sort of coherent point let alone backing it up. 

>1948? You mean the war where they Arab League rejected the proposed two-state solution and instead decided to try to wipe Israel off the map completely, only for the aggressors to be decisively defeated and lose their own territory to the much smaller, nascent country? That one?

I accept all that as true. What does it have to do with zionists ethnic cleansing of civilians?

>Gaza wasn't even under Israeli control after that, but still in Egyptian hands, who themselves severely oppressed the Palestinian population, the whole time Gaza being used as a proxy state to further Egyptian political goals. It wasn't until '67 in yet another outnumbered war, surrounded by hostile neighbors that Israel finally seized Gaza (and the Sinai, only to give it back) in response.

I accept all that as true. What does that have to do with zionists ethnic cleansing civilians? 

>It's like crying about the Nazis losing the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia when the Allies pushed them back to their own borders.

You're justifying zionist ethnic cleansing. The zionists committed massacres, and forced Palestinian civilians from their land.  You compare it to a justified military operation.

I assume you condemn Hamas's murder of civilians. How do you square the two ideas in your head?

Also, are you Jewish or Israeli? If you are, it would be helpful for you to identify yourself so readers can get a better understanding of the perspectives in this issue."
I don't doubt that that's what you think. lmao

"These are Canadians, many not even Palestinian by blood. What material reality changes when they condemn hamas. Why is it that every person who is on the edge of being critical to the Israeli war crimes has to verbally condemn hamas, but when we see a jewish person supporting the war they don't have to condemn any words or actions of the Israeli government.

why does the idea of wanting human rights have to come with asterisks?"
"Well what else can you do? They’re not going to just let terrorists sit there forever, firing on them without repercussions."

It's extremely hard to broker peace because the main power players here have non-starter demands (also kind of Israel's fault) and would both likely fight for control and tear apart their own country further even in a free state scenario. Their tactics and strategy in this war profoundly shows me that they are only interested in their own agenda and not protecting their people. Both Hamas and Israel seem more than comfortable sacrificing lives for their own end."

"Hezbollah is completely different, maybe they have the same goals regarding the Israel/Palestine conflict, but Hezbollah is a Shia group, those other ones you mentioned are exclusively Sunni. They are funded by Iran but they have their own regional goals, one of which is to protect the existence of the Shia community in a sectarian region. Hezbollah is aware that the Sunni community (Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine) supports it most when it's in conflict with Israel.

"Uh no. They even released pictures of murdered and charred babies.

Exactly. He even admitted it then reverted right back to yeah they’re basically terrorists. I also wasn’t saying no Palestinians support Hamas. I was saying let’s not assume they all do because it’s not true
"Israel isn't leaving the WB because of what happened in Gaza. Had Hamas not taken power they might have, but if Israel leaves PIJ or another group or Hamas certainly will take over in the WB. Without security guarantees or a peace deal, Israel is forced to stay because they don't want a repeat of Gaza.

You're certainly joking about terror activity in the WB. Jenin is a hot spot for terror in the West Bank. There are issues there all the time. Terrorists who are planning attacks or running as they already murdered someone are often here. The settlers attacking Palestinians I fully condemn. Don't suggest the West Bank doesn't have terrorism activity from Palestinian groups."
"They were starving because of their government - Hamas, not because of Israel. 18,000 Palestinians from Gaza go to Israel to work every day. Meanwhile, Hamas uses all of their resources and international aids to create weapons. Here's an example of Hamas turning water pipes into rockets to fire into Israel: https://youtu.be/uCBFnhEX8j8?feature=shared.

Instead of directing their children toward education and economic development, they teach them to make hating Israel their life purpose: https://youtu.be/vCWMBvxWKL0?feature=shared

And it's not an open-air prison. Gazan people still go to Israel to work, and they can cross the border to Egypt. Unfortunately, of those people who go to Israel to work everyday, many have taken the opportunity to gather intelligence for Hamas in the recent attack. It's really bad for Palestinians that Israel now will likely think twice about letting them in to work again after this."
"I appreciate these organizations voicing their concerns when civilians are in danger, that's their job. But they should stop there. In the context of a conflict, how do they decide what is legal and what is illegal. What does recognising the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination mean. They have been self-determined, and the majority of them in Gaza have chosen Hamas to be their leader and support Hamas. They didn't want the two state solution in the past because they have determined that they want nothing less than 'death to all Jews'. Where was the UN Human Rights Office when rockets from Gaza have been firing into Israel indiscriminately for years and it could have been a total catastrophe had they not been able to defend themselves."
"Here is a better argument: a poll in 2021, conducted by the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research found that 53% of Palestinians were of the opinion that Hamas was *most deserving* of representing Palestine and a whopping 72% had a positive opinion of Hamas. The same Hamas that uses Palestinian children as suicide bombs. The same Hamas whose written directive is to exterminate all Jews, when given the chance, and to expel all Jews from Arab lands. 

https://apnews.com/article/hamas-middle-east-science-32095d8e1323fc1cad819c34da08fd87

More recent polls show that close to 60% of Palestinians view Hamas in a positive light. 

Of course, we have close to half of Palestinians that do not support Hamas. It’s absolutely ignorant, xenophobic, Islamphobic and bigoted to assume all Palestinians support Hamas (and therefore support terrorism) or that Hamas represents Islam. 

But to reject the claim that there are many  Palestinians that do support Hamas is asinine."
"How important is it, really, for ""her"" side to win?

Her side is gonna treat her like property if they win.  They won't win, but if they had their way, she'd be barely above a chattel slave.

Hamas is explicitly an ethnonational project that says on judgement day all jews will... uhh... die (somehow).

There are numerous geopolitical reasons that Israel is propped up by the west, but this lady is either willfully ignorant of what her role would be in the post-revolution situation or straight up only using this as an aesthetic."

"Israel was fine with that occupation. Not only did they put hamas in power but they made sure Hamas would maintain power over time. 
 
 
Here is a fun quote from them in 2019: [*Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas,” Netanyahu told his Likud party’s Knesset members in March 2019. “This is part of our strategy*](https://twitter.com/haaretzcom/status/1711329340804186619)"
"> in the hopes that they would be friendly towards Isreal and counter the current government at the time who was not.

No, they wanted the religious extremist in power to help justify their war crimes. They even said so themselves and explicitly mentioned they want Hamas in power to prevent Palestinians from getting international support. 
 
Hamas was calling for the death of all jews BEFORE the Israeli gov pushed to get them in power. They also continued to actively help them stay in power up until now. This is well documented, even by zionist Israeli medias, just google it. It's one of the reasons Netanyahu has a >85% disapproval rate right now, he actively supported the organisation that did the attack."
The Gaza Strip and the West Bank are two Palestinian territories
"Lmao, You posted that do you protest what you believe or don't believe."

I am neither, Herr Kommandant."
">Why is it that every person who is on the edge of being critical to the Israeli war crimes has to verbally condemn hamas

Maybe because they are a designated terrorist organization with the sole aim of wiping out all Jews in their official charter? With their leaders giving calls for global jihad. Yea am not gonna put the two on the same page.

>but when we see a jewish person supporting the war they don't have to condemn any words or actions of the Israeli government.

Jews and for that matter the international community have condemned Isreal numerous times https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/15/us-jewish-groups-statement-occupation-israel-palestine-netanyahu 

https://youtu.be/d5HNYlaR8qc?si=RFC7u4HOBtO1oBpf

This is the difference, Jews have spoken out against Isreal while Palestinians haven't, infact they have outright celebrated the hamas attacks across the world, not one leader of theirs has condemned the attack."

"Israel is punishing 2 million people for the actions of around 1000 terrorists. The response is a disproportionate amount of force which could have the end result of massive loss of civilian lives. What Israel is doing is not ok. Israel absolutely has the right to defend itself, but cutting water, food and medicine, and forcing the evacuation of 1 million people, including injured and sick, elderly and children can't really be described as a 'defensive' measure."
Israel butchers Palestinians as well.  The fight is for land. Takes two to tango.

"Oh, I did understand that you meant that appeasement happened before the war, I was mostly poking fun at the idea that the Brits didn't kill Germans.  

But also, yes?

The humiliation of Germany following WW1 was a significant reason for the appeal of Nazi rhetoric.  For instance, the idea of Lebensraum:

>During the First World War, the Allied naval blockade of the Central Powers caused food shortages in Germany, and resources from German colonies in Africa were unable to slip past the blockade; this caused support to rise during the war for a Lebensraum that would expand Germany eastward into Russia to gain control of their resources to prevent such a situation from occurring in the future. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensraum)"
Israel has killed tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians over the decades. Plenty of Palestinian casualties at the most recent violence - the al Aqsa mosque attack by Israel. Also various kids shot the past year.

"Here’s how I know Israel doesn’t want peace either — despite what they say. Israel military authorities took control of all of the water in Palestinian Occupied Territories in 1967. They control water access for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. 

Palestinians can’t build water infrastructure — let alone collect rainwater — without a permit from Israel. These permits are almost impossible to obtain. Don’t say this has anything to do w security, because you can’t turn a bucket into a bomb. 

Even before the blockade in this war, Israel gave Palestinians just 73 litres of water to use per day. How much does the average Israeli use? 300 litres a day. We use 330 litres a day in Canada. The Word Health Organization recommends 100 litres as a *minimum.* 

How insane is that? If I took my fucking dog to a restaurant, some server would give him a bowl of water outside. Israel treats Palestinians worse than dogs"
There’ve been about 30 different peace conferences since 1919. It’s been Palestine each time that’s walked out of them.
Israel created Hamas. Tell me who doesn't want peace now?
"Your lot keep making that false assertion and it's starting to wear thin. People are marching in support of the thousands of Palestinian civilians trapped in Gaza, being bombed (6000 times so far), starved, and brutalized by an occupying army many orders of magnitude larger and more powerful than Hamas.   


Also, if you care about dead babies maybe try giving a damn about the [700+ killed by the IDF](https://www.dci-palestine.org/724_palestinian_children_killed_in_gaza_as_israel_targets_civilians) in just the last few days?"
My original point was that a protest against Hamas is pointless because our government already considers them a terrorist organization. A protest in support of Palestine is reasonable given the West's blanket support of Israel and Israeli government actions wrt the Palestinians
Both things were fake. Photos were AI generated.
"Ben Shapiro released a fake photoshopped picture of a burned baby. 

I'd gladly look at any other evidence you can provide though.

Edit: a word."
"Israel maintained similar conditions of occupation in the period from 1993-2005 in the West Bank, before Hamas was elected. You can’t maintain an occupation without violence towards the native people. 

Also on Jenin, who are the Palestinians terrorizing? There’s a big huge wall around the city and a bigger one along the border with Israel."
"Okay sure and I won't disagree with those findings. But did you ever stop and think as to why? People get radicalized and kick people over parking spaces here in the West. What do you think a blockade, living in hopeless conditions, and not allowed to go back to your home would do to a person? I can't justify crimes against civilians, but I totally get the radicalization of an entire desperate population."
"If you ask people in Crimea, 106% of them support Russia! (Apparently). 

In July 2023 50% of Palestinians said Hamas should just support a two-state plan with 67 borders, 62% supported maintaining a ceasefire.

While 60% support Hamas in a recent study, 64% support Fatah. Hamas’ popularity has dipped, and will continue to dip into the conflict that they have single-handedly pulled Gaza into, and the civilians are stuck in an authoritarian regime.

Give Gazans a choice between Fatah and Hamas, I’m sure that more than 64% will choose Fatah."
"Her side is fighting for their existence. Full stop. Resistance by any means necessary is their mindset. They can worry about the governance of their people after. They live in desperate situations and debating on internal politics is a privilege they don't have. It's survive or die in Gaza and many Palestinians see it that way. 

People here in the West can't grasp that because of our soft and privileged lives where we have the privilege to even debate these situations."

"> News to me. I thought I was just stating historical facts.

You're not making clear points or arguments, so I have to guess what your point or argument is.

If you were confident in your beliefs you would make clear concise points backed up by facts.

Listing facts, and implying a conclusion is how unconfident people make their case. Because when someone challenges their implied conclusion they can say ""I didn't say that."" Yeah, I know you didn't say that. You didn't actually say anything. Because the facts don't speak for themselves. They must be interpreted."
"Yes Jewish people have spoken out against their government, those are the opinions that don't get the air time. These are the opinions that do get the major air time on news networks from current and former officials who have the power to kill. https://youtu.be/ghvNeYd7Xz8?si=rwUUpCPjUWzqbCmD

Every time someone wants the killing in Gaza to stop they have to condemn hamas because people see brown skin and immediately think terrorist. It's never about being the humanitarian, it's about deflecting and distracting away from all of Israel's war crimes, thirst for Palestinian blood, and unprecedented zionism over decades. 

In a week more children in gaza have died than in the year and a half of the Ukraine invasion, but let's not talk about that let's shift the focus back to hamas each and every time."

She keeps calling Trudeau a nazi for sending money to ""nazi Ukraine"" and claims Ukrainian soldiers are only fighting to protect themselves from Russia so they can get rich collecting Canadian dollars that Trudeau is sending them or some insane bullshit. Half the shit she writes is barely even legible. 

I literally cannot comprehend that level of stupidity. How does natural selection not take care of these fuckwits? 

She also constantly posts ""Fuck Trudeau"" shit, still makes constant anti-vaxx and ""Covid a hoax"" posts, pissed about Trudeau being pro-LGBTQ+ and posts constant anti-LGBTQ+ shit, Turdope is trying to brainwash your kids into being gay and trans, and is constantly calling Trudeau a terror to Canada because he's anti-Christian.

They murder innocent Israelis and they use Gaza civilians lives for propaganda. They use gaza civilians as a shield and then they parade around their corpses to gain support. It’s all part of the plan. They know they’re getting “their own” ppl killed. They know that muslims and bleeding hearts around the world will take the bait and argue on their side. “But but but I’m not for Hamas I’m for gaza civilians “ yes but you’re sheep falling for terrorist propaganda. If you’re for gaza civilians then you should be against the ppl getting them killed, Hamas. So if you’re against Hamas than you should be in favour of an armed invasion to remove Hamas, to save the lives of civilians on both sides. Also, anybody who thinks Israel should just not respond militarily after such a cowardly & hateful terrorist attack should know that absolutely nobody respects their opinion."

"They're not indiscriminately bombing, it's very difficult when Hamas deliberately uses civilian locations rendering them military targets.

"Yes, I’m aware that nothing justifies this, thus why I said “atrocities that hamas committed”. Something that seems unique to me though is that I don’t believe that what hamas did justifies Israel killing Palestinian civilians either (Hamas killed about 1300 and Israel has killed over 2300 since the attacks). I don’t believe that civilians being killed is ever justified, regardless of where they are from (and I’m talking in all wars, not just this one). 

There have been smaller acts of aggression more or less constantly since the end of World War Two (be it rockets, missiles, bulldozing homes, etc) with the occasional flare up like right now. I guess you could say that the latest hamas attack started the latest round of constant Israeli bombing/missiles but to act like this is happening divorced of history is absurd."
Ok but no reporter has confirmed it either. Its one thing to not post it publically put of respect but literally nobody has seen actual evidence. We are all just supposed to trust the Israeli gov
"You do know that Free Palestine used to be a 5 word slogan right? There's no mincing words. Their whole thing is to destroy Israelis. That's not parody. That said, I don't believe Hamas speaks for all Palestinians because they haven't given their people a chance to decide that in years."
"So then I ask again, what number. How many dead kids are acceptable to kill what number of Hamas fighters ? 10 kids per fighter ? Is that too high ? Too low ?

Time and time again the lesson has been learned that you can't bomb an insurgency into submission. Invading Gaza, cutting off food, water and electricity, is not going to destroy Hamas. 

You kill a bunch of insurgents, wayyyy more civilians, and the insurgency has a bunch of new atrocities you committed to point to and continue the cycle of hate that keeps the insurgency alive. 

I don't have a solution, but I'm pretty sure what's happening in Gaza right now is not one."
"Eliminate Hamas through airstrikes and a ground invasion ? Just like how the Vietcong were eliminated ? Or the taliban ? 

Nothing short of the complete genocide of Palestinians in Gaza will ""eliminate"" Hamas through military force alone, you can't bomb insurgencies into submission. 

Every civilian you kill just creates two new Hamas fighters. More children with memories of Israeli atrocities, more teenagers with a burning hatred, ready to die to kill as many Israelis as possible. 

Invading Gaza is no solution to Hamas. Just like invading Afghanistan was no solution to the Taliban."

"The water issue is far more complicated than you think, especially since Israel transfers 50 million cubits of water to water parched Jordan every year as part of a trade agreement.

But Hamas has turned all available water pipes built from foreign aid into rockets to attack Israel

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/10/10/eu-funded-water-pipelines-hamas-rockets/

Heres a Hamas propaganda video where Hamas boasts about turning the pipes into rockets themselves. You get to see how the rocket production works too.

https://twitter.com/visegrad24/status/1712465490160050516?s=46

So its not actually Israel's fault this time, especially when they transfer water to Jordan without issue and to the west bank without issue. This is one of the few times where you can point at one side and 100% blame Hamas for this without saying Israel is partially to blame."
"Wrong.

Palestine has had its own separate government since the mid 2000s and can build its own infrastructure. It’s chosen to use the funds and aid to make weapons.

pipe purchased, for example, has been used not to lay new water lines in Gaza but instead to
Make rockets."
"You omitted the part about how most of Hamas' rockets use casings made from water pipes.

That's why Israel keeps tight control on water infrastructure, after they were burned in the past."

"I’d like to preface my comment by saying that I never support violence against civilians, regardless of what side they are on and what war it is in. It is quite clear that you cannot say the same thing. 

Hamas killed 1300 civilians and Israel has killed 2300 since last weekend. This is not acceptable. Both sides are indiscriminately killing civilians which is completely unacceptable. 

The beheading of children has been called into question (most notably by Reuters) but regardless of the way that children are being killed, it’s not acceptable. Whether it is by a gun, starvation, bomb or beheading, it is never ok. 

Quite frankly, the US and Canada’s unconditional support of Israel shows that they don’t care if civilians are killed on mass. They should be going for a ceasefire, not moving military equipment to the region."

"They most certainly *do not* transfer water to the West Bank “without issue.” 

> rainwater harvesting cisterns owned by Palestinian communities are often destroyed by the Israeli army. As a result, some 180 Palestinian communities in rural areas in the occupied West Bank have no access to running water, according to OCHA. Even in towns and villages which are connected to the water network, the taps often run dry.

> While restricting Palestinian access to water, Israel has effectively developed its own water infrastructure and water network in the West Bank *for the use of its own citizens in Israel and in the settlements* – *that are illegal under international law.* The Israeli state-owned water company Mekorot has systematically sunk wells and tapped springs in the occupied West Bank to supply its population, including those living in illegal settlements with water for domestic, agricultural and industrial purposes.

"If this was true, they’d at least let people collect rain water. But the Israeli Military destroys rainwater cisterns too. It’s not just in Gaza, but all Palestinians — including in the West Bank. Hamas isn’t in the West Bank. There are no accounts of Palestinians in the West Bank launching rockets at Israel. It is no about safety. It is about occupation and control.

I don't think I need to show video of the Russian citizens being arrested by Putins police force for you to understand the sarcasm here.

And everyone keeps going back to the single. SINGLE attack after 70 years of occupation and ethnic cleansing. It's not a genuine discussion about humanitarianism, it's about violent revenge and attempts to justify killing children, killing UN staff, using white phosphorous, and killing any international journalist who dares not think that these innocent civilians in gaza deserve it. The government agrees that these aren't crimes against humanity, because Palestinians are not human in their eyes.

But let's talk about how much Israel truly cares about its citizens. The immediate response of Israel was to bomb gaza. They did not attempt to liberate the areas hamas did attack, they took no special care for their own citizens as hostages with the bombing, and Netanyahu had intelligence of the attack before it happened and did nothing to protect the innocent Israelis."
"One side uses civilians as human shields, the other does not. If Hamas is going to intentionally hide behind civilians then civilians are going to be killed in Israeli strikes. Nobody is happy about it. But the bottom line is they’re not just going to sit there and take it forever because Hamas is using human shields."

"Yes Hamas chooses to hide in densely populated areas to hide behind civilians, which has the effect of more civilians dying. Again, a decision made by Hamas"
"They’re not both indiscriminately killing civilians. This is a very important detail. The Hamas attack made a point of attacking schools so they very specifically sought out to murder innocent children. Hamas uses civilians as shields. They hide behind civilians and unfortunately civilians do die . But here’s the thing, both of these situations are because of choices that Hamas actively make. They murder innocent children intentionally across the border and use their own civilians as a shield, their responsible for the high civilian death rates alone. Invade gaza! Liberate the hostages of Palestine if that’s what they are"

The civilian population of these bully nations ended up paying the price -- as they tend to do when they allow their leaders to do stupid things and attack their neighbors aggressively.

If the Palestinians as a whole hadn't shown Israel time and time again, since the nation's inception, that they could not live in peace without killing their neighbors, things would have played out quite differently. Perhaps all Palestinians could have been happy Israeli citizens like some of the other Arab Israelis that enjoy living in peace with their neighbors.

As it stands, it's not just Israel content to let them live behind a wall: Not even the other Arab nations will accept the Palestinians through their borders, as they tend to cause civil wars and attempt to assassinate heads of state. Massacring multi-national festival goers and beheading infants in their cribs while celebrating it on TikTok certainly doesn't help with their branding.

"You can't claim Hamas is using human shields, if Israel bombs them anyway. That's not a shield, is it?

You say ""no one is happy about it"", but there are videos of Israelis cheering as the bombs fall.  The President just claimed ""they are no innocents in Gaza"", so it's clear he has no problem with bombing children.

Also, Israel has shut down food, water, and electricity to an area that includes half a million children. That's not 'targeting Hamas', that's a collective punishment of innocents, and it has happened repeatedly, even without the provocations of last week.

I know there are countless Israelis who are as horrified as I am by the violence being inflicted in their names, but you can not honestly suggest that there is no hatred towards Palestinians."

Israel is also not allowing civilians to leave Gaza through Israel and they bombed the Egyptian border crossing. There are absolutely ways that they could be getting Hamas that doesn’t involve bombing hospitals (which is apart of what they are currently doing). 

This is equivalent to saying that the US was justified in carpet bombing Vietnam and all of the surrounding countries because there may have been Vietcong members around (Which I hope, you believe is deplorable)"
"Ok, well by that logic (which might actually be right) the Israelis also aren’t indiscriminately bombing civilians. They are purposefully targeting hospitals, aid workers and journalists. 

I’d like to say this again because you don’t seem to understand: the killing of civilians is bad, regardless of if it’s being done by Hamas, Israel, the US or Canada (or any other nation/organization/terrorist group you can think of).

"The answer is the IDF and settlers are the target, and the targets are in the West Bank, a territory they have no business in and territory where the extremist settlers cause extraordinary hardship for palestinian civilians. Jenin itself is in Area A, meaning it should be under full Palestinian control. However this is not the case as raids are common, as are bombings. Is Israeli settlers taking Palestinian homes not terrorism? Is Israeli settlers lighting kids on fire not terrorism?

It’s interesting that you lump the PLFP, PLO, and Fatah in the same boat. Fatah is now actively coordinating with Israel and yet Israel isn’t even upholding their end of the bargain. Fatah/PLO IS the peaceful option, yet all it got them was more land theft and more extremist settlers killing their people and taking their land. It seems to me that any sort of Palestinian resistance, peaceful or non-peaceful, will earn them the moniker terrorist."

"The fact that the shields aren’t 100% effective doesn’t make them not human shields. It’s in Hamas’ interest to increase their own civilian casualties, which they are doing.

"Getting rid of the common but false idea that Israel represents all Jews would help with reducing antisemitism much more than this editorial, and yet the author of this piece mocks the Jewish people in this demonstration as merely making ""a Rosencrantz and Guildenstern appearance"". 

Antisemitism needs to be opposed, but opposition to what Israel is doing is not antisemitic. Despite the star of David on IDF uniforms or hanging behind Netanyahu in every speech he delivers, Israel does not represent all Jews."
"So here is what I'm going to say about this article. Antisemitism in all of its forms, right wing, left wing, European, Middle Eastern, religious, secular, Christian or Muslim expressions should be opposed. Including forms of antisemitism that emerge in Pro Palestinian circles. However what's also clear is that the accusation of antisemitism is weaponised to silence an open conversation on Israel's policies to the Palestinians. 

Skimming through this piece I get the sense that any type of strong criticism of Israel's policies would be term as ""villification"" or ""antisemitic"". Which to me is a form of political correctness because those who defend everything that Israel does are essentially saying ""you can criticise Israel, but we want to police the boundaries of what you can or can't or what you should or shouldn't say about Israel"". 

Fact of the matter is there is no government or state that should be treated as a political sacred cow. None. Does matter what it's identity, it's ideology, or it's history. Saudi Arabia is a Muslim majority state. Muslims experience Islamophobia. That does not meant the Saudi government should be exempted from strong critique over it's theocratic policies as well as it's brutal blockade of Yemen. China of course is a state for Chinese people. People of Chinese descent experience Sinophobia and anti Chinese racism. That does not therefore mean the Chinese state should not be critiqued for it's repressive authoritarian policies, it's suppression of dissent, and it's policy of cultural genocide among the Uighurs. 

Same thing goes for Israel. Antisemitism is real and it needs to be challenged in all it's forms. That does not mean Israel should be treated as some sacred cow. So when many activists who are more nuanced say Israel is guilty of ""war crimes"". Israel is guilty of ""ethnic cleansing"". Israel is guilty of illegal settler policies that creates violence and repression for Palestinians. This isn't ""villification"". These are international legal standard standards that the Israeli Supreme Court itself states that Israel is legally obliged to hold by in it's domestic laws. This is also in line with strong, organic movements in democracy that give powerful critiques of their government. Martin Luther King Jr for example at the height of the Vietnam War stated that the U.S government was guilty of war crimes was one of the ""greatest purveyor"" of violence. The strong critique of the Israeli military's conduct is no different from that. People are just putting their personal comfort and their personal attachment to a state over the facts surrounding the record of human rights of that particular state or government."
"Committing genocide, while quoting genocide is by no measure a defense."
"Anyone who comes in here with a ""hurrr durr theyre all terrorist supporters"" is no different than people who think ""all jews are evil"". This kind of binary thinking is why this conflict keeps on dragging"
If it was empathy for Palestinians why wait until Oct 7 to start protesting?
[deleted]
Apartheid and genocide are wrong I don't give a fuck what country is doing it. All ethno-nationalism is evil.
"Timing matters. Celebrating on October 7 or the next few days after 1,500 were killed in Israel was beyond the pale. Protesting Israel's bloody response and the death of so many civilians today is different.

What was Hamas hoping to accomplish? This. They wanted Israel to strike back so hard and indiscriminately that other nations felt compelled to step in on their side. That hasn't materialized so far - likely because of the US presence in the region - but is still a possibility.

I also feel that, pulling the strings behind the scenes using partners Iran and Syria, Russia is at fault for this - they distracted the world from Ukraine and pretty much got the response they wanted from the US, which is a pause in funding for the Ukrainian counterattack. They are the only party that's come out ahead."
The media is terrified.
Just read the comments here. People are willfully trying to ignore what these are about.
"I still can't wrap my head around a few things.

1. Protests literally immediately after a terrorist attack on civilians being perceived as ok
2. Explanation for the above point has been whatabout ie. if things Israel has committed are wrong, why protest right after a terrorist attack? There's something about that which smells insincere, duplicitous.
3. Protest ""River to sea"" chants are about wiping Israel out, not about a 2-state solution
4. Why did the pro-Palestine crowd choose the day after an atrocity to make their point in western countries? Could it be because of a lot of clickbait bandwagoneers only care about followers on social media? That's really fucked up, but not an unreasonable conclusion. I mean... Andrew Tate has a lot of followers just sayin'

At this point, it doesn't matter. These 2 sides will never come to terms unless they're made to by force. The former Yugoslavia is a decent example of that (until it boils over... again.)"
"Well Israel slaughtering over 4000 children and bombing refugee camps doesn't exactly do great things for their PR. I know how dare people oppose such a thing, damn anti-semites"
"I'm all for freeing Palestine of Hamas. This should be the common goal. No Hamas means no more war.

Unless of course these people support Hamas in their terrorism efforts."
Anyone get the feeling that /r/Canada is being astroturfed lately with histrionic pro-Israel perspectives?
I just want the old Canada back. This would never have happened in Canada before 2000. These new Canadians are pretty scary.
Calling everybody protesting for peace and ceasefire racists will definitely work to win the public on your cause. /S
"Serious question. 

What do the protesters hope to achieve by protesting in CANADA?

This isn’t a domestic issue like what the freedom convoy was protesting.

It’s not like Justin Trudeau is going to look at these protests and decide to send in the Canadian military to take back gaza from Israel."
And not a mention of people denouncing Hamas actions :-(    .. just hate for Israel whipped up into a frenzy!
"Can anyone remember large protest marches for the violence in Yemen? How about in support of the Armenians in Turkey? Anything against Iran killing thousands of its own civilians? 
    
Exactly."
cause all the dead children.
Definitely the hatred thing. When has anything since the rise of social media been about lifting anyone up rather than putting someone down?

"Can someone please help me understand why the hatred and energy isn’t being focused on Hamas? Seems like the Israeli response to their initial 1,400 killed should have easily been predictable. No offence intended, just an honest question I don’t understand.."
Responsible immigration requires bringing in a variety of people and backgrounds so they don't form ghettos to make them avoid living life like we do. Not bringing millions of Muslims to the point where they're more in power than even we are.
"I despise Trump, I am not anti American.

I thought invading Iraq was a collossal fuckup, I am not anti American.

The think the US war on drugs is a failure, does not make me anti American.

Y'all see the pattern here, disagree with a 'certain' country's course of action and its labelled racist and hate."
"Israel is losing the message war here. They need to only state stop hiding behind your civilians and playing the clips of Hamas saying they will strike again soon. They should just be repeating those 2 things over and over and nothing else.

They should also let the med in all those below sea level tunnels."
The fact that protestors refuse to publicly condemn Hamas for their abhorrent treatment of their own people makes me question whether they actually care about the plight of the Palestinians or just see this as an opportunity to target Israel and Jews.
Maybe canadians understand apartheid and occupation are wrong. And see their plan is to make Gaza unliveable and displacing all the people in Gaza and dumping them on other countries so they have no claim to return to the land when it is now assimilated into the whole of Israel. Its a chess game think 4 moves ahead. What the IDF is doing and getting away with is unthinkable.
"Are protests by Jewish people also ""beyond the pale"" like this one in new York ?

"Without really saying it, this article assumes anti-Israel means antisemitism.   Not true. People are rightfully mad at the Israeli government. Also rightly mad at Hamas. This on,y gets solved long term if religion is removed and these institutions are judged on their actions…  all their actions since the 40,s."
"DiManno can always be relied upon for a perfectly stupid take. Death, taxes and Rosie DiManno being an idiot."
"More than 85,000 Yemini children died under the nose of Muslims. That's 21 times more than what's happened in Gaza.   


30,000 children were killed in the Syrian conflict, that's nearly 8 times more than what's happened in Gaza.  


4,000 Palestinian refugees were slaughtered in the Syrian civil war.  


Lebanon banned Palestinians from working as doctors, or lawyers or from owning land.  


The Palestinian authority tortures Palestinian prisoners.  


Palestinian police murdered a journalist for opposing their government.850,000 Palestinians were displaced in the Syrian civil war.  


Lebanese militants killed 2,500 Palestinians in refugee camps and displaced and displaced another 30,000 Palestinians.  


Hamas dragged the dead bodies of innocent Palestinians through the streets of Gaza.  


Hamas hid weapons in Palestinian children's schools, and recruited children to become Jihads.  


Hamas murdered the last Christian pastor in Gaza.  


Hamas stole food, water and other humanitarian aid from their people to fund terrorism.  


Neighbouring Arab states refuse to accept a single Palestinian refugee, even temporarily.  


Nobody came out for these children in London, Paris, New York, Sydney, or Toronto. None of these Muslim influencers started any trend like we are seeing now.  


If you are only outraged by Israel's actions, then you are not pro-Palestinian, you are anti-Israel."
"Occupied Palestinians? The Gaza Strip hasn't been ""occupied"" since Israel pulled out completely in late 2005.  I remember seeing Israeli settlers on CNN being dragged, literally kicking and screaming, out of their homes by IDF troops at the time.

They gave them back the whole territory, and how long did it take for the Hamas bastards to take over and start shooting rockets into Israel?"
"I have empathy and anger at both sides. Mostly it's a problem of religion. 

 Faith is belief without thinking, what could go wrong?"
"Israel is an apartheid state and is now committing genocide.

of course the protests are anti-Israel, what did they expect?"
"Calling someone Anti semite is a political tool now, you don't agree with what Israel is doing, you're an anti semite like wtff"
Your opinion is incorrect
"How about opposition to ethnic cleansing, no matter who the perpetrators or victims are?"
"I don’t know what is so hard to understand:
UNTIL the Palestinians unequivocally recognize Israel’s right to exist, nothing will change. Allowing a terror group like Hamas to rule them does nothing to help their cause."
"they hate jews , not one demonstration against ISIS. Especially muslims, they were happy about the caliphate, thats why they didnt say shit , over 300k+ killed, arabs killing arabs ….
when was the protest? not a single"
"People, particularly those on the left, are quick to separate Palestinians from Hamas. I agree there needs to be a separation. But these people are also just as quick to lump the Israeli government and Jews together. And that is not okay at all. And people on the right tend to do the exact opposite. 

The problem is that neither side is completely right, or completely wrong. But neither side wants to compromise"
This newspaper really hates Arabs and Muslims huh. They're barely disguising it.
canada has always had a very strong anti-jew presence. it's why not many jews choose to live here. the hatred is real.
"Call it what it is, empathy for terrorism and antisemitism.

This however is the importance of freedom of speech, look around you at the virulent terrorist supporting anti semitic cancer infesting universities, and other institutions that permeates all of Canada.

This is the reality that progressive naivety built.  Keep on holding those protests and let people know about the cancer festering within their midst."

"Not one demonstration from Palestine supporters against hamas, not even a shred of condemnation."
"I’ll believe the good-faith of those rallies when I will see public condemnation of Hamas and demands to release all hostages, alongside with condemnation of Israel and demands for ceasefire.
Until then I will consider those rally as pro Hamas."
"Trying to delegitimize protests of over 100 thousand Canadians by saying there were people who may have said something ""antisemitic"". Knowing full well that the protestors are there to voice their concerns over the ethnic cleansing,  by a universally declared occupation by an Apartheid state is despicable and complicit with the war criminals. 

Many protestors were jews as well. This opinion piece is a pathetic attempt to label peaceful protestors asking for peace and an end to a brutal and illegal occupation as something they are not. 

Trying to defend a racist, genocidal regime by accusing protestors of being ""antisemitic"" is the height of hypocrisy"
they were PRO PALESTINE not Anti Israel...
"I guess, in the western media perspective, blowing up the death star and killing millions with it in a fantasy film is heroic, but retaliating after 70 years of oppression in the real world is antisemitic."
"Fuck off, this propaganda is nauseating. Free Palestine. No hate for Jewish people, and fuck Hamas. FREE PALESTINE."
Netanyahu and Herzog have issued terrible threats against a citizenry of 2.3 million. Herzog went so far as to claim none were “innocent.” Perhaps these leaders share some responsibility for lost feelings of safety around the world?
"Israel is a zionist state backed by nationalists from European decend and evangelical Christians those whose priest need private jets and mega churches to do God's work.

Jews come from Africa,  Arabia Lebanon or even old Palestine heritage. So nothing antisemtic . Barnie sander who's  a jew can condemn Israel and he will be called antisemite"
War is bad eather way attack and bomb people and then get pissed when they retaliate. You brought it on yourself. Then hide behind children? And expect outrage. I don't think so
It’s good to see anti-war protests but it’s worthwhile to ask why this is the only conflict that gets this kind of reaction.
"In all honesty, I have empathy for both sides. War sucks. They both need to stop their crap. That is literally my take on this entire war. And pretty much on every war ever almost.

Now that said, I do obviously feel compassion for both sides. Both have lost a lot of innocent lives. 

However. They need to stop their protesting at least in Canada. 

I understand having a couple protests here and there. Fine. But this consistent protesting it it’s already too much. I understand they want to help but to any protester that’s reading this. What the hell do you want Canada to do? We can’t do anything. We have our own problems. 

Can I protest I’m an income single mother, not being able to afford Housing? Can I protest that in Palestine? Even if I could would  Palestine do anything about it? 

Of course not. Because there’s nothing they can do. Same as Canada. We can’t do anything. Think we could do would take away resources from our own country civilians, who have their own problems

You should just be lucky Trudeau brought you here. You’re safe from bombs and war and all that horrible stuff. You’re safe here. Be thankful for that. And a lot of your refugees. Have a lot more than I have. So please be thankful that is how Canada is helping you."
"Question: Why do many of you claim that ""ethnic cleansing is happening""? What do you mean by that? What is the evidence for that claim? Genuinly curious.

My understanding of the term is that it means the forcible removal of a certain ethnic or religious group for the purpose of creating a homogenous region. Israel has a total population of 9 mil. 3 million of those are Muslim/Arabs and Israeli citizens. So where is the ethnic cleansing? Enlighten me"
"Zionists need to stop hiding behind the Jewish faith, which they do not actually adhere to."
"This is about hating Jews. There were no protests about the Syrian civil war or Yemen or any of the other atrocities in the region. No pressure for Egypt to open the border with Gaza and accept refugees.

That being said this conflict doesn't affect Canada, I don't our leaders need to pick a side but they should be speaking out against mobs attacking Jewish businesses and community centres. How scared they are to do the right thing is pretty concerning."
"Most of these protesters, in my humble opinion, lack critical thinking skills. They judge and decide what to support purely from a virtue point of view. They, in many cases believe whatever suits their narrative without seeking any further analysis or evidence. It basically boils down to them not wanting to hear or see anything else beyond their personal opinion. Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood are extremely good at making propaganda that paints a false narrative. It doesn’t end there though. Outwardly it also absolutely shows an uptick in antisemitism to our Jewish community."

"I’m pro Jew , pro Islam  pro Israel  pro Palestine . 

Anti Netanyahu anti IDF anti Hamas .

Israel being held accountable for their human rights violations isn't antisemitic.
"Left wing loves to call right wing Nazis while the left wing spreads anti jew propaganda right outta the nazi playbook, and applauds them in parliament."
"It can be both. 

It can also be empathy for Jewish victims and hatred for Hamas at the same time. 

The idea that these are mutually exclusive is absurd and is encouraged by the power brokers who gain from this and the tool that is often used is “racism” or “antisemitism” if you dare fall out of their line."

"2 questions to ask for these so called pro palestinians protests to reveal if they are pro hamas terrorist sympathizers.

1. Do you support Israel eradicating Hamas and freeing Palestinians from the clutches of Hamas. Yes or No.  
  
Obviously the cunning hamas sympathizers will claim ""what about the innocent civilians of Palestine"". Well If Palestinians would have fought Hamas directly to free themselves, Hamas would have obliterated them and killed 100s of 1000s of them in a war anyways. If Palestinians truly don't want Hamas, and want freedom from Hamas terror org,  then casualties are inevitable. So I see no difference when there is collateral damage when Israel attacks Hamas, as that collateral damage will be lot less than if Palestinians were directly fighting Hamas. Freedom for Palestine will be worth it.  
  
If anyone answers No to this question, then it means they are defending Hamas terrorism and don't give 2 hoots about Palestinians.  

2. Do you support the 2 state solution for Israel and Palestine to exist. (Yes or No)  
  
Obvious stuff. If they say no for Israel's existence, then they are genocidal.

&#x200B;

Reality is that a lot of arabs in the middle east hate Israel and the Jews. Anyone who has lived in the middle east or has close people there, knows this. There is no reason to think that arabs to migrate to the west suddenly will change their stance.

&#x200B;

In this social media era, it is easy for a large group of motivated people to manipulate public opinion in their favor. So now you have a lot of motivated arabs flooding the social media and college campuses spouting their rhetoric demonizing Israel and covertly defending Hamas , while common polite Canadian is not equipped to handle this sort of behavior. This way the former's narrative is imposed, and the polite Canadian either gets fooled into buying it, or is accused as racist by these antisemitic genocidal racists."
"The media who have been beyond the pale in their support of Israel for the last 40+ years is trying to tell me someone else is beyond the pale? Please, stfu."
"People have eyes and ears. Everybody knows Israel has been killing Palestinians at a ratio of 20:1 or more over the last decades, well before the current violence.

How many George Floyds were there in those tens of thousands? When will Israel be held to the same standards as other countries?

They were themselves founded and led by avowed terrorists. But let's not talk about that..."
anti-Israel protests are the key words here.
"4000 children have been murdered since Oct 7th. I get 5 or 10 human shields 4000 is crazy. In 3 weeks the right winged racist government Israel has in power has morally bankrupted not only Israel but also the United States and the entire west. How Putin and China are supposed to be the bad guys but asking for ceasefires while the US which is supposed to be the worlds good guy vetoes them is beyond me. That’s what people are protesting for the 4000 innocent children and in total 10,000 innocent people murdered in cold blood by the state of Israel. 

Also those numbers make ISIS look angelic and that’s the craziest part about it"
"Israel is an apartheid state that has sustained a prolonged occupation on Palestine for about 60 years. Note that that this occupation is not even talking about the ethnic cleansing and terrorist campaigns of the Nakba. People no longer want to be gaslight that any criticism of a country that has received over almost 150 billion in military assistance from USA, while committing horrible crimes, must be antisemitic. About 1400 Israelis have were murdered by Hamas on Oct 7, over 10,000 Palestinians, half kids, have been murdered by Israel since then. This number won't include [these kids](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/17ozt2u/i_cant_believe_what_my_eyes_saw_ya_allah_i_forced/) one of whom literally has an open skull with his brain blown out last night. This number will also not include the 250+ Palestinians killed by Israelis and the IDF this year before Oct 7.

If Israel wants peace they should stop apartheid and military occupation of Palestinian territory. But Israel doesn't want peace. Bibi has been caught on camera many times detailing his ethnic cleansing plans. His father literally confessed to following the blueprint of how natives in north america were ethnically cleansed. Many disingenuous Isreali supporters say ""Israel has offered peace and the return of territory many times but the Palestinians rejected it because they just want to kill all the jews"". [A member of the American party has long refuted these allegations](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/08/opinion/fictions-about-the-failure-at-camp-david.html). It's really funny how many people who agree Ukraine shouldn't be forced to take Russia's ridiculous terms change their mind when Israel does it.

At the heart of every form of messaging from the pro-Israel side is the consistent dehumanization of Palestinians. Whether it is [the defence minister calling them human animals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x02rCeusCI), [Bibi's party buddy basically saying ""Right now, one goal: Nakba! A Nakba that will overshadow the Nakba of 1948""](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/11/palestine-israel-nakba-war/675859/) (which is funny because Israel bans mentions of the Nakba (violent dispossession and ethnic cleansing campaign to ""free up"" the land for jewish residents), [the army spokesperson literally said that their focus is on destruction not accuracy](https://www.commondreams.org/news/israel-gaza-bombing) along with many other disgusting statements by govt officials. Today, a minister was suspended because he literally called for nukes to be dropped on the Palestinians. This consistent dehumanization is necessary for Israel to sustain and justify its apartheid and military occupation. The world has seen this before when the with the Nazis and the Rwandans. Very similar is the ""no one likes the Palestinians"" rhetoric that you will find in this very thread. It was used on the jews and they were likened to pests and insects that everyone hated. But it is false, these protests in Canada and elsewhere have showed that many of us do care and are paying attention. I have never seen such large pro palestine demonstrations ever is so many places. And that is because what Israel has been doing and is doing is wrong.

At the very least, I don't want Canada to participate in Israel's disgusting project any longer. Yes, we should ensure the safety of our jewish and muslim populations but we should limit our engagement with that terrorist country. This conflict has really opened my eyes as to how bad Israel is."

Disgraceful...
">“Jews Say No to Genocide’’ — I didn’t feel the crowd’s empathy for occupied Palestinians as much as brazen hatred for Israel. Of course I can’t see inside anybody’s heart and there are a host of reasons for people participating in these events. It’s a civil right to assemble and protest, after all. But it’s palpable — at the heart of these protests is vilification of Israel.""

Nope, it's not. There are some nutters, but people just want Israel to stop bombing children and extend the same rights to Palestinians that are afforded Israelis. This isn't hard to understand.

&#x200B;

>The scrutiny of Israel, its one-way obligation to adhere to restrictions of armed combat, its pillorying as an accused apartheid state — t**his country with free elections, freedom of speech, Arab parties in the Knesset, an Arab Muslim sitting as chief justice; where 150,000 Palestinians were working every day before Oct. 7** — has been unparalleled.

Uh, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are not able to vote in Israeli elections. But Israel is in complete control of the West Bank with a military occupation, and movement in and out of Gaza is completely controlled by Israel.

Either Palestinians from those areas should be allowed to vote in Israeli elections under the current situation of security control, or the West Bank and Gaza should be treated like separate, sovereign nations, and Israel should turn border control over to them where they are not sharing borders (basically an end to the maritime blockade, and the Egypt border), and should remove their military and illegal settlements from the West bank.

Palestine may end up being a combative neighbour - at which time, military confrontation in the form of a war between sovereign states may take place. That is not currently the power dynamic, however.

NONE of what I have said makes me antisemitic."
"People are realizing the truth and the main reason for all this killing, they see that if the Palestinian does something to Israelis, the world goes crazy, if Israel does the killing most countries don't care. So now they see this and they want it stopped, the truth always prevail."
"Not just Israel,they hate Jews."
"Can I just congratulate r/canada for having any non-extrémist voices whatsoever? I mean, the « KILL EM ALL AND LET THEIR FALE GOD SORT EM OUT » assholes are HERE, but they’re not EVERYONE. It’s a great change of pace!"
"I'm still trying to figure out how Canada got dragged into this, as opposed to Peru, India, Korea, Lichtenstein, Finland or Denmark?????"
"Those protests will not stop the war, specifically if you are in another country, and the protest isn’t really raising awareness because at this point anyone already understands what is happening btw Israel and Palestine"
"Assuming that the ultra right wing, Zionist, Netanyahu government who run an apartheid state adequately represents the Israeli people as a whole is itself anti-Semitic rhetoric. Saying free Palestine is absolutely not anti-Semitic, just as saying you are against Zionism is not anti-Semitic. The Israeli people are not monolithic. The Palestinian people are not monolithic. Anti-semitism is unacceptable. Islamophobia is equally unacceptable.


Don't allow any news outlet to persuade you into believing that you are on one side or the other. Horrible people exist in Hamas, horrible people exist in the Israeli government and the IDF. The unfortunate reality is one side is trying to pull off an ethnic cleansing and displacement - and it is not the side who is stuck inside the Gaza strip."
"Imagine having a fascist state constantly trying to tell you that they know what's best for you and your ""people"". Giving the world lessons on the Holocaust, while committing murders in the name of their religion and political ideology.

"The expression ""Beyond the Pale"" to defend Isreal is wildly inappropriate."
Everything about this war is beyond the pale
Thanks mate
Israel's leader Benjamin Netanyahu swiftly distanced himself from the remark by Eliyahu and suspended Eliyahu from meetings of Israel's cabinet.
"Bibi is by *far* the first in line to blame for painting this picture that any criticism of his government is antisemitic. He wears that defense like it's holy armor, and he is entirely aware that he is stirring the pot to force the Jewish disapoara to either be with him or against him."
"Israel needs people to believe that being critical of their government is automatically antisemitic because that’s their single biggest propaganda tool. Their political allies help to push that narrative because they recognize how important it is to Israel from a PR perspective. 

If you’re critical of the North Korean government nobody suggests that means you’re hateful towards all Korean people. Same with Russia, you can be anti-Putin and no one accuses you of having ill will towards all Russians. Of course you can be critical of the Israeli government, the IDF and Netanyahu without being antisemitic. Netanyahu and his policies aren’t even universally loved by the Israeli people, there have been increasing unrest over his actions both in and outside of Israel for years."
"While it's true that Israel does not represent all Jews and opposition of Israel is not necessarily antisemitic, I see quite a few truly hateful/antisemitic people hiding behind this. It really depends on context, how you express the opposition, etc."
"Thank you, this point which is so often glossed over. Opposing the actions of a state or military is not and cannot be equated to antisemitism. it's a false argument. That being said, antisemitism cannot be tolerated. Neither can we tolerate Islamophobia, nor racism."
Really surprised to see something this sensible posted here. Normally the sub is hysterical pro-bibi commenters with bad faith sweeping generalizations.
"> opposition to what Israel is doing is not antisemitic.

It often is, it sometimes isn't. Really depends what people say, how, and when. For example, Fred Hahn of CUPE called the October 7 attacks that slaughtered thousands of Jews ""progress"" for Palestine. That's antisemitic. Saying ""I disagree with Netanyahu's policy for settlers in the West Bank"" is not."
Israeli government and other Zionist forces intentionally conflate the two so the reasonable conclusion you’ve drawn can be immediately dismissed as bigotry
Exactly.
"I’m not even anti Israel. 

I’m pro Jewish, pro Israel and anti IDF, Anti Settler,"
"Israel may not represent all Jews. But it does represent half of the global population of Jews.

Calling for its destruction, as many at these rallies do, is calling for the genocide or ethnic cleansing of 9,000,000 Jews."
"They deliberately push this idea from their media operations. They know they commit war crimes etc, they have operated as a protected class from the press, etc since they showed up in palestine. The USA is representing all their interests and vice versa."
"Opposing Israel, the homeland of Jews is antisemitic. Period."
Opposition to Israel as a state is hateful and anti-Semitic. Full stop.
"I stand with Israel…. Especially as they are doing what they have to to protect their people.  Hamas is just doing what these crap cowards have always done and thats attack first then hide behind innocent people… What should happen is ceasefire should be sanctioned permitted palestine coughs up hamas leaders. Hamas leaders meet madame guillotine and all these innocent people are not caught between this. 


Palestine is indeed somewhat responsible as they have allowed this to happen. Lives are gonna get lost but theres gotta be some responsibility on Palestine for allowing terrorist organizations to recruit, coordinate and plot attacks on other countries plain and simple."
"The author is a moron, I cannot imagine she has anything intelligent to say on any topic, even sports, her apparent area of expertise."
"My friend of 8 years said this to me on Saturday: 

Such a Jew thing to say.
It always matters right or wrong.
You're so pathetic. You can feel the Jewishness coming out of you and through my phone. It's Making me sick.
Don't ever talk to me again.  

It has been sitting on my stomach like a nervous pit for 3 days. All because I said Hamas has no chance in hell of winning against 9 million Israelis backed by the US and they must ask for peace if they want everyone to stop dying."
And Palestinians are Semitic.
"I agree with a lot of your points, but you're missing the big one - for decades, people haven't been calling Israel out for ""war crimes"" to try to make the situation better for Palestinians (Israelis literally do that when they protest Bibi)... They've been doing it to support their stance that Israel shouldn't exist.

In my lifetime, I've never seen vitriolic calls for the destruction of an entire country based on what its government does. Imagine protesting China's human rights record and saying that the solution is to give all of China back to Taiwan."
"Israel is not ethnically cleansing or committing apartheid. 20% of Israel is Muslim and is well integrated in society. 

Otherwise I agree, settler policies by Likud are disgusting"
People who say all that shit just want to feel competent and the internet circle jerks are their only chance.
"Weird take, when the article shows a sign saying the attacks were ""self defence"""
"I'm sorry but you have a very white-westerner view of the matter.  


As an immigrant who came here after living in the middle east, I know that sentiment for violence against Jews is a deep part of Islamic Culture. We're taught this in Islamic Studies classes at schools.  


The people you see from Palestine waving flags right away on Oct 7th  do not give a damn about the brutalized Israelis or the hostages."
"I agree, it’s no different.

But that is far far far from the reason why this conflict keeps on dragging."
I wouldn’t say that they are necessarily terrorist supporters. The problem is that the terrorists are literally hiding behind them. There was a video on the weekend showing Hamas shooting at the IDF from a hospital. That is a war crime. Israel retaliating is devastatingly sad but not a war crime. How do you propose Israel deal with Hamas? The only thing that will stop Hamas is the death of every Israeli. Is that your solution too?
"It's like the Taliban in Afghanistan. If enough people support it, there's really nothing we can do about it. Sometimes you just gotta let it go, no matter how horrific. Kind of like all the nasty shit that's been happening in Iran lately, we can't do a single thing about it.

If Canada sends in humanitarian support, chances are they are going to be kidnapped and/or killed. Once something like that happens, this war that everyone thinks is nasty, will get really bad. If the UN won't even touch it, then it will become a massacre."
"There have been massive pro-palestine liberation protests during every single protracted conflict. I remember going to protests in 2021, 2014, etc. These are by far the largest they have ever been, but they have always been pretty substantial.

I don't know if you're young or if you've just never been tuned into the issue. But people have been protesting this for a long long time."
"There have been protests , research , etc for years. This isn’t new"
You really believe that free Palestine political activism only began after 7th October 2023?
Because they’re celebrating terrorism against Jews.
"Yes, the October 7th terrorist attacks were vile and awful. 

However, I think these protests are more a response years of this:

https://www.ochaopt.org/page/publications1

https://www.vox.com/2014/7/14/5898581/chart-israel-palestine-conflict-deaths

If we want to equate in numbers of who has lost more lives in modern history. Then Palesntine definitely takes the brunt of civilian deaths. Including the current count of 10,000, including 4700 children.

https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-11-06-23/index.html"
Palestinians weren't being killed at the rate of thousands a week prior to then.
I'm confused how I'm not supposed to have empathy for people dieing no matter who they are.
">If it was empathy for Palestinians why wait until Oct 7 to start protesting?

Dead on!"
"Pro-palestine demonstrations have been happening before October 7th.  Things are just ramping up now,  and getting attention for obvious reasons, but you knew that, and are likely being intentionally inflammatory."
"There have been many protests on many different days, have you been paying attention?"
Because Israel wasn’t killing 10k innocents a month in September. Obviously.
"Is this a serious question....?

Because Israel didn't blow 5,000 kids apart in a couple of week yet?"
Because its in the news now and it'll get attention
"If you’re asking that question then you only started paying attention a few weeks ago.

Israeli Apartheid has been an area of protest for decades."
Why didn’t the media ever report on Israel’s atrocities before October 7th?
"People have been protesting for longer. Israel has been committing crimes against humanity and war crimes way before Hamas was even conceived, and waaaay before Israel themselves funded Hamas.

You just don't know anything prior to Oct 7th because Western media doesn't care about any conflict unless a Western imperial power is threatened. Ever wondered why the ongoing genocide in Congo is also largely ignored? What about the expulsion of Afghan refugees from Pakistan? Israel making Ethiopian Jews unable to have children against their consent?

Reminds me of how the Imperial powers of Europe and the US didn't care about Germany's plans to exterminate ""the unwanted"" until Germany threatened them. Shit, the US even rejected ships of Jewish refugees.

One would think people in Canada would have slightly better critical thinking skills than Americans, but it also seems like ""what isn't on TV isn't real"" also applies here.

But this is certainly not the first time I've seen people care about Palestine. Definitely the most people I've seen walk out in public, yes, but it's 200% because the proportion of Israel's massacring of innocent civilians, doctors, journalists, UN workers, foreign nationals, AND their own citizens who were hostages, is beyond anything that had been seen before. Do you think the numbers of Israelis protesting and demanding Netanyahu to resign also indicate that somehow they're self-hating Jews, or that they're celebrating terrorism, or that they're Hamas supporters or covert fighters?"
Because you haven't been listening for the last 75 years.
"Freedom for Palestine, BDS, etc… have been things for years. It’s only now reached a boiling point."
"till shit hits the fan , most humans don’t act . Oct 7 was the day , shit hit the fan so to speak .  Are you unfamiliar with basic human psychology? 

Or are you the type who always plans ahead in life and always somehow acts at the right time well in advance . Stop kidding me , you’d not be wasting time on Reddit if you were this category ."
Can’t speak for others but I’ll tell you why it is for me. I’ve only started paying attention to the Israel Palestine conflict since Oct 7. Prior to that they are completely out of my radar. As someone living a comfortable life here in Canada I don’t pay attention to conflicts in some unknown place so far away.    But it was since Oct 7 that I started researching the conflict between the two countries and realized there is an ongoing genocide there and it has been happening for 70 years. I didn’t know. Simply didn’t know. And now that I do I want to help stop it. You have no idea how completely out of touch everyday folks are. Oblivious.
"Because it was obvious what would happen next, a massacre was coming and we knew and spoke out. The same massacre happened anyways"
"Did you just emerge from living in a cave? This isn’t a new issue and opposition to Zionism also isn’t new. It also isn’t anti-semitism. This has been kitchen table conversation in my family my whole life. Unfortunately many people were clearly uninformed about the situation. 
It’s also important to note that this propaganda calling any criticism of Israeli policy and Zionism anti-semitism has meant many people have been censored and silenced for a long time."
"Facts. Why have a rally after October 7 though? It felt like a celebration of Israeli casualties. After Hamas is ousted, Gaza should be a UN administered Zone, policed by peacekeepers for 10 years minimum like Kosovo. Rebuild, send the kids to school that teach useful skills not jew hate, build an economy. If Gaza doesn’t relapse into terror groups after UN leaves then it might be high time to pressure Israel to abandon the settlements in the West bank for a fully sovereign Palestine comprising All of West Bank and Gaza and maybe some Arab majority cities in Northern Israel if they vote to join Palestine in a referendum. Idk how that would pan out though, they reject being handed over to Palestinian Authority in exchange for the settlements. Question is why do Israeli citizen arabs insist on staying Israeli if they’re being genocided? 🤔"
">Where was the outrage when Hamas killed 1400 civilians?


They were celebrating"
Ok and in retaliation the civilian death toll on Palestinian side is over 10k. So how many times do we condemn Hamas before we can have a ceasefire? Will 100k dead will be enough for 1500 Israeli deaths how many give us a number pls.
"The outrage was all over the world, did you not watch the news, see the speeches from politicians, the new antisemitism positions instantly created in more then one country, the front of every news paper and site.  

What do you mean?"
"Where was outrage over last 50 years when people remained stateless. Have fewer and fewer rights.  They are being kicked out of homes with violence and killed. 

Majority of world condemned Hamas.  Few condemn Israel in the west.  

Where is the outrage when elected Israeli ministers are increasingly talking genocide.  

https://youtu.be/f6sQTqzfu48?si=TYdV9iXkNwkCPpm_"
"They care about their civilians not Israel civilians, which is true for both sides. It’s the same reason why Israelis don’t care about the death toll in Gaza since October 7. It’s a war between two indigenous people that see each other as subhuman. They have faced decades of trauma and torment from both sides. Both have been born in a country, surrounded by violence, and been raised to hate the other and fearful of extinction. The main difference is one side is supported by the best military in the world, and funded by one of the biggest countries the other side has been systemically, oppressed and displaced for half a century. Of course if any Palestinians want to eradicate all Jews, that person is disgusting, but the same is true for any Israeli."
"There was a lot of outrage for that, though Israel's reaction to it was so swift, extreme, and actively going, that it quickly took over as the more pressing issue."
"Where was, whatabouts are all we are restricted to to justify the shit."
"Where was the outrage when the IDF killed 10,000 civilians? Doesn't seem like the pro Israel rallies are really about the concern for civilians."
"“It doesn’t seem” is notably not a fact, it’s just your feelings."
Are you aware of how many Palestinians Israel has killed since 1948?
"We don't support Hamas, our government support Israel.

What were we to do? Protest that the government label the terror organization a super duper terror group?

We give Israel money and diplomatic cover and they happen to kill far more children then those we (rightly) label terrorists."
"isreal claims to have killed 20,000. this includes at least 5000 children"
"You're looking at it the wrong way.  
There were a lot of people demonstrating their solidarity towards the victims of the terrorist attack. Yet, that doesn't mean that the overwhelming majority of these people are ok with Israel's occupation of Palestine and the mistreatment of Palestinans.  
By the same token, the majority of  people who attended the so-called pro-palestine  protests don't condone Hamas terrorist attacks. Of course, there are outliers, but it's unfair to put everyone on the same boat.  


One could reverse your question and ask ""where was the outrage when Israel built thousands of illegal settlements in the West Bank? Where was the outrage when Israel killed 37 Palestinian kids in the West Bank, this year alone?"" One thing doesn't take away from the other. Both can be true."
"What is there to protest?  Hamas?  We condemned them and they should be tried for murder.  Canada supports Israel, so the protest is to show that they shouldn't.  This isn't hard to understand."
There was literally worldwide outrage. The hell are you talking about?
Everyone has their own agenda and narrative and they're sticking to it.
"Please enlighten us what it’s all Really About, o wise one"
"If no hamas means no war, explain the West Bank. No hamas there, yet occupation, land theft and killing continues"
"There also can be no peace while Netanyhu is in power, even without Hamas. He will never allow there to be peace when his power and popularity depend on war"
They do support Hamas.
Palestinians voted for Hamas and seem to still have broad support. And why wouldn’t they? They are fighting back when all other Palestinian organizations have given up.
Totally.
"Yeah they started in worldnews and have branched out.

Plenty of random accounts posting rabid pro Israel propaganda every hour of the day for weeks now."
"Totally, and its not just /r/canada. Noticed smaller subs are also getting hit, altho it was a bit delayed in comparison to the bigger subs."
"Oh please. Some of us respect the history of World War 2, our Allies and are sick of this ignorant and hypocritical bullshit."
"And so the echo chambers begin. 

Both sides are wrong. Therefore, each side is right, right?"
Lmao and that's a bad thing? Should we just let Hamas sympathizers take over?
"If you notice that pro-hamas perspectives aren't kept up as long or as often it's possible that it's because their supporters know that calling for support of terrorism is illegal in Canada as stated in the Anti-terrorism Act.

But a quick check in with fellow citizens to determine if they think the bare handed killing of babies on Oct 7 can be justified can lead you see that these people have a different moral stance - one which does not align with Canadian values."
The way world News was astroturfed isn't even subtle
YES.
"How do you know they are ""new Canadians?"""
I find myself asking this about American unions. Who exactly is Local 503 helping by getting the second shift to chant « from the River to the Sea » or whatever?
International pressure is *super* important with this kind of stuff. Remember when boycotts and protests from around the world helped take down apartheid South Africa?
"Why must we start every sentence with ""I condemn Hamas but...""? Why do only minorities get targeted with the bigger burden and be forced to denounce the bad players everytime? None of us like Hamas but they're a terrorist group and can't be reasoned with. There is no point repeating our hate for them. Humanitarian aid has to end up in Gaza somehow. Meanwhile, Israel is posing as a democracy and ethnically cleansing a group they have oppressed for seven decades. I sure as hell hold a recognized UN state to a higher standard. Besides, when we protest against Israel we're not saying that we have no sympathy for people hurt by terrorists. There is just a bigger focus on the issue of Israeli oppression as Palestinians are unjustly punished tenfold for what happened on October 7."
Lol they took to the streets in celebration after 10/07
"Without a doubt, Hamas is a nasty organization and both Israel and the Palestinians would be better off if they faded away.

But Israeli leaders have made the clear point over the years that they see Hamas as an asset: https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/

Hamas was enabled by the Israeli government because they wanted to divide and weaken the Palestinian movement that was coming close to peace in the 90s and early 2000s. Hamas provides them with political cover to refuse negotiations (they have refused to negotiate since 2014, evne though the PA has been open to it and requesting it). The Palestinian government, pre-hamas era, had recognized Israel as a legitimate state, and was attempting to negotiate. But what happened when the Palestinian leadership reached an agreement with Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin?

Rabin was assassinated by an Israeli extremist. Netanyahu was one of the loud political voices inciting against Rabin, calling him a traitor for trying to make peace.

The reality is that the dominant political party (Likud) in Israel over the past 20+ years did not want peace. They wanted to annex the whole West Bank, and still do, as evidenced by the rapid increase in West Bank raids and settlement expansion since Israel's extremist right wing government took office.

Israel must return to the negotiating table. The vast majority of Palestinians want nothing more than to be able to MOVE ON. But the occupation makes that impossible. Until the Israelis give them an opportunity to actually build a state, more despair will grow in young Palestinian hearts, and despair will again turn to hatred."
">Can someone please help me understand why the hatred and energy isn’t being focused on Hamas?

Because the government of Canada isn't trying to rally people behind supporting Hamas?"
"Liberals believe that the world can be separated into oppressors and the oppressed and the oppressed are always morally correct. So because Israel has the larger military they are the oppressors and Palestine are the oppressed. 

They don’t care that Palestine are radical islamists that don’t believe in woman’s rights or gay rights or rights of any kind. They don’t care that Palestine started and has continued the violence. They only see the Palestinian violence as a justified response to years of oppression. The nuance and intricacies of the 75 year conflict don’t matter to them."
"When a child has his water turned off and sees his sister's corpse in the rubble of an Israeli airstrike, he will only understand that Israeli's pulled the trigger.

We would all love for Hamas to be ousted and for Gaza to return to being a secular democracy. But it's pointless to protest them under the current conditions. Mass civilian casualties are not only ineffective for removing Hamas, but it will also radicalize more children who eventually become Hamas militants. The Gazan kids who had their families incinerated in 2014 are fighting age in 2023. It's a vicious cycle of violence and Netanyahu has openly capitalized on it through the years."
"Because they aren't against Hamas - they're only against Israel. 
They aren't in favour of saving innocent life either - because there was nothing out of them when their team slaughtered Israelis.

They just hate Israel and quite a lot of them hate Jews in general - that's it."
I think because 99% of people think Hamas is a terrorist group that should all be dead so its hard to go further than that. Whats left to discuss?
"Because hamas is a terror organization and illegal.

What would protesting it do? Get the government to label them super terrorists?

Israel is a close ally, a nuclear state, we give them money, we sell them arms, we provide diplomatic cover for them. 

And they have killed over 5,000 more children..."
"There was a lot of hatred and energy for the terrorist raids on the 7th of October 2023. That was a month ago, and people are now focused on *currently ongoing* events, which are almost exclusively the Israelis indiscriminately killing Gazan civilians.

I'm not exactly sure I see the point of your question. Is it: because you think the IDF's response is predictable, are you saying they should be exempt from any condemnation? 

There are also so obvious clues that suggest the Israeli government is not being honest with its aims:

* If Netanyahu truly want to free the hostages like he continues to say over and over, why has his government refused to entertain any hostage exchanges or negotiations? Heavy bombardment puts the hostages safety at risk and has already killed some of them. 

* The IDF gave an impossible order for two Million residents of Gaza City to travel south within 24 hours, outside of the area of operation per the IDF statement. And despite this, has conducted repeated air strikes Jabalia Refugee Camp, a place well south of Gaza City. They're openly violating their own terms of engagement with respect to civilian casualties. 

* The IDF is preventing humanitarian aid from entering Gaza for the refugees.

* The heavy-handed bombardment of civilians, such as hospitals, suggest they don't value Palestinian lives. Ask yourself: would they be as brutal if there were Hamas cells holed-up in downtown Tel Aviv?


**edit:** Guy I'm replying to claims to be ""a person who just doesn't understand, asking an honest question"", but if you go to their comment history, it's continuous downplaying of the humanitarian disaster and civilian casualties in Gaza. Curious."
"Btw I condemn Hamas….. below is some info about the number of lives lost on both sides since 1987. 

This has been going on since the early 1900’s. After the British occupied Palestine in 1917 they basically announced its support for a Jewish state in Palestine with disregard to the people who already lived there (Palestinians). Over the years they slowly took more land and displaced/killed the people who it belonged to. In 1948, 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from the area that is now Israel. Things have progressively gotten worse and worse over the years but it has been an ongoing fight between Israel and the resistance in Palestine. 

So although people do condemn Hamas, they also feel that what has been done to Palestinians these past 100 years is horrific. 

https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/05/18/the-israel-palestine-conflict-has-claimed-14000-lives-since-1987"
Because most people on this protest like the idea of about 1000 dead jews
"Yes, absolutely. The clear line is that you're *not* saying or implying things like ""America is inherently evil and should be destroyed,"" ""the killing of American civilians is justified because of their evil policies,"" or ""America is to blame for 9/11."" 

Now ask a few protesters or strongly opinionated people what their ultimate best-case dream scenario is after the dust settles. Does peace and freedom for Palestinians coincide with peace and freedom for Israelis or do they have to come at the cost of the destruction of Israel? 

The answer to that is the line between legitimate criticism of the Israeli government's truly horrific policies and anti-semitism masquerading as anti-zionism."
When was the last time Pro-Israel protesters had to condemn all the stuff their government is doing?
"Yup, when I saw it was The Star I knew 100% it was DiManno. Next!"
"This isn't a conflict between Lebanon and Plaestine. This is a war between Palestine and Israel. So condemning other Arab nations for atrocious acts in the past doesn't correspond to the actual situation currently playing out right now. 

At the moment, Israel's incursion doesn't optically look strategic from a global perspective. Having been criticized by many who were active in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other Arab countries. Also, stories like this don't support the Israeli narrative either:

https://newrepublic.com/post/176534/cnn-host-blitzer-stunned-israel-hit-refugee-camp-airstrike"
"Israel controls and blockades the entire Gaza border. 

It's occupied for all intents and purposes."
"Not occupied?! What do you mean?!? Gaza is an open air prison and Israel controls their food and imports? They’ve been on lockdown for the last 15 years

https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/06/14/gaza-israels-open-air-prison-15"
"When these rallies have signs that call to throw all the jews to the trash, yes, this is anti-Semitic"
"I don’t know what is so hard to understand:
UNTIL the Israelis unequivocally recognize Palesines right to exist, nothing will change. Allowing a terror group like Likud to rule them does nothing to help their cause."
Yea because western governments weren't supporting ISIS. Use your head
">they will impose sharia on your country

Lmao. Did I wake up back in 2002?"
[deleted]
"Not that worrisome, I'm way more afraid of Evangelists taking over."
Watch out - we're the boogeyman
Hamas is popular in Palestine. The people supporting Palestine are in fact voicing their support for the anti colonial struggle as it inflicts back the brutal violence of the colonial state onto Israel. It is ugly. But it is a war and it seems people around the world have chosen to side with the Palestinians.
"The Death Star is a legitimate military target. The Rebels didn't land on Coruscant to murder and rape as many civilians as they could, then hide under hospitals."
You wouldn't have known what a Palestinian was if it weren't for these protests. Awareness matters
"Jew-haters need to stop hiding behind ""anti-Zionism""."
">There were no protests about the Syrian civil war or Yemen or any of the other atrocities in the region. No pressure for Egypt to open the border with Gaza and accept refugees.

This is just whataboutism. These protests are specifically about Israel's treatment of Palestine and how it has reacted since the horrfic Hamas attacks. While, yes, those attacks were terrible, it doesn't justify the military actions that have occurred since, or the last 75 years of poor treatment of the Palestinians. You can't claim a moral high ground while simultaneously dropping bombs and killing civilians.

>That being said this conflict doesn't affect Canada, I don't our leaders need to pick a side but they should be speaking out against mobs attacking Jewish businesses and community centres.

Yes, they should."
"Israel wasn’t involved in those conflicts.

What’s happening is that Israel is engaging in some very familiar rhetoric and tactics, and has stated some familiar goals.

Nice try, though."
"The fact that you just think it’s about them being Jews is so braindead 😂 I can’t 

And people in the west care because our governments are funding this disgusting war"
"Nothing wrong with hating radical Islamist states like in Gaza, Iran, Afghanistan, Algeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, etc….

Notice a trend?"
"Abby Martin’s sole job nowadays is working for RT News (owned by Russian government) and Telesur (owned by Venezuelan government).

But sure - go ahead and listen to whatever manure she is spewing into the world."
"To be clear to others reading this comment, by occupier this person means all of Israel. I.e. this person thinks Israel rightly belongs to the ""natives"" and thus Israelis have the moral obligation to let themselves die. This person, ironically, lives in Canada."
You can't colonially occupy your homeland that's a ridiculous statement.
">pro Islam

One of these things is not like the other"
And being critical of anything related to Islam is not Islamophobia.
"The majority of Gazans are children. Gazans suffer from, even before the current war, malnutrition, lack of potable water, lack of medicine, lack of income of any kind...

And, you expect them to magically fight and defeat Hamas? (An organisation that Israel had a hand in supporting, to undermine secular PAlestinian movements, I'll remind you.) And because they didn't magically overthrow Hamas, you believe they deserve any violence done towards them? You are a bloodthirsty human being. 

If the current Israeli actually wanted to ""free Palestinians from the clutches of Hamas""; they wouldn't have refused recent peace proposals, they wouldn't continue displacing and colonizing Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, and they certainly wouldn't have covertly supported Hamas. Netanyahu and Likud have not been good-faith participants in this conflict.

""*Those who want to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state should support the strengthening of Hamas and the transfer of money to Hamas... This is part of our strategy, to differentiate between the Palestinians in Gaza and the Palestinians in Judea and Samaria.*"" -- Benjamin Netanyahu

Between Israel and Palestine, only one 'side' is successfully carrying out an ethnic-cleansing campaign against the other."
Ok now do Hamas
I wonder how Aljazeera gets the bias treatment and not this garbage?
"For a second there I thought Avi Lewis took a right wing turn.

"Revolting.

>I don’t care if you think we are at fault, that we had it coming, that Hamas’ actions’ didn’t occur in a vacuum (or to deny they ever happened).

Meanwhile... Israel has been killing Palestinians at a ratio of 20:1 or more for decades. That's not ""defending"" yourselves. In normal countries there were huge riots sometimes because of a single unjust killing. But apparently in Israel they stopped counting LONG before the current violence.

We say the rise of radicalism here in recent years because of curfews and people butthurt because they couldn't go to the gym. Now imagine living your daily life in Gaza and the West Bank..."

Bibi is such a fucking moron “hitler didn’t want to kill the Jews until a Muslim convinced him to”
Your analogies insinuate people are merely criticising the Israeli *government*. The reality is they’re criticising Israel’s *right to exist*. Night and day difference.
"Sure—just like any issue some extremists fall into groups opposing Israel.

Still doesnt mean all people opposing Israel are antisemitic"
"> I see quite a few truly hateful/antisemitic people hiding behind this

It doesn't help when you have Israeli diplomats and other officials pulling bullshit ""either you agree with us and our Palestinian genocide or you're an antisemite that supports the Holocaust"" stance. Along with all of the Israeli ""talking-heads"" that go onto talk shows and news programs where they yell loudly and proudly over top of anyone that has any level of criticism for the actions of the Israeli government/military."
[deleted]
There's been a spike in both islamophobic and antisemitic sentiment since October 7. It comes from the extremes of both sides. Its disingenuous to focus on the hate coming  from one side but to ignore the other
"Do you think Palestinians or people sympathizing with their cause are just out to get the Jews? 
Isn’t this an ongoing conflict of people who were forcibly displaced for the creation of Israel? 
Look at the founders and early settlers (70-90 years ago) of now Israel, they all came from Europe! For people who were kicked out of their houses and farms just so those people can form a nation, is injustice! Many Jews don’t agree with Israel and don’t wanna be associated with as much as so many Muslims don’t wanna be associated with Afghanistan, Iran or ISIS! If you’re against ISIS, you’ll find many Muslims on your side and it’s the same with Israel, Jews around the world aren’t obligated to support Israel just because it’s a Jewish state, many Jews oppose it because of that! 
It’s dangerous to call anti-Israel movements anti-Jewish! Eventually you’ll run into Jews who oppose Israel more than any Palestinian ever did and they have their moral and religious justifications for that!"
"Support for Palestinians in many ways acts as an anti-Semitic dog-whistle.

There's plenty of reasons to criticise Israel. But there's also plenty of anti-Semites using that to shield what would otherwise be clear anti-Semitism. What other nation could be the target of that level of war crimes and then people will suggest that any military response is unjust?"
"Sure is strange that Israel engaging in ethnic cleansing and genocide is leading to a rise in antisemitism. How totally odd and unexpected.

Next I’m going to be told that when nazi crimes became well-known, it led to anti-Germanic sentiment. Truly a shocking outcome if this happened."
"Considering that arabs are also semites, Israel itself could be considered anti-semitic for the war crimes it is doing"
"I've noticed those who are ""pro-Palestine"" tend to play fast and loose on what is and isn't anti-Semitic."
"> Saying ""I disagree with Netanyahu's policy for settlers in the West Bank"" is not.

This policy directly affects how they go about military action, as they have either greed in their eyes to make Gaza land part of Israel or they have full on hatred of all Palestinians (not just Hamas / radicals). Bombing civilian targets that may or may not have Hamas inside only creates more radicals when people turn their hatred for the loss of loved ones towards Israel. This benefits the ""Zionists"" because it gives them an even greater carte blanche to destroy more of Gaza while looking the other way when Israeli settlers rush in to grab up all of the ""newly freed"" land.

At the very least, the Israeli government could be stemming the tide of the settlers, and punishing those that push into Gaza following military operations.  The fact that they don't even do this much is them blatantly revealing their hand to all because they don't even think they have to hide it.  They want to bulldoze Gaza and turn it all into Israel.  They use Hamas and other Palestinian groups as an excuse to accomplish this goal.

In the end, Israel is the one with power here, and Palestine is the underdog.  Regardless of what the radicals are doing -- however horrible it may be -- Israel shouldn't get a free pass on criticism of their actions.  It's like an adult and a kid fighting. The adult is going to be held to a higher standard of behaviour.  Someone has to ""act like the adult"" to stop this instead of just pointing and saying ""they started it first."""
"Its beyond just opposing. Settlers, by international law, are not considered civilians. The right to resist settlers and the IDF is enshrined by the international criminal court of justice's guidelines. 

To call for violent resistance, which is a human right, against the terrorist settlers and the occupational IDF is not anti-Semitic. To call for it against civilians, is of course wrong and to be opposed. 

I think this point isn't clear enough for the average person."
"Fred hahn is a tart and doesn't represent the protests.

What happened on Oct 7 was horrible.

What the IDF has been doing even prior to Oct 7 is horrible.

It is perfectly fine to call them BOTH out. Does not make you antisemitic."
"Although it might be behind the curtain, at face value it isn't. Which is part of the problem with linking Israel to jews to semites. So first, lets at least agree that 'anti-semitism' is the stand in word we use to describe discrimination against people who are religiously Jewish, as well as the (imo more dubiously concocted) racially Jewish. The actual definition of a semite, afterall, would likely include most Palestinians, and (ironically) not necessarily all jews.

So... 

It'd be like if Hong Kong's pre-CCP-takeover's organized elite made an attack on mainland China and someone supported that. You wouldn't say they're anti-Taoist or anti-sino. That would sound patently ridiculous.

But anti-China, or anti-CCP, those labels work.

This person can quite earnestly support even a terrorist attack on Israel without being anti-semitic. They can politically see it as progress without religion. Whether they do or not is another story, but that's what this proclamation says at face value."
"Al-Aqsa flood was not a pogrom it was a militaristic response to Israeli assaults, occupation, and general oppression. You are projecting antisemitism into the equation by framing the killing of Israelis (many of whom were not civilians and some of whom were killed by the IDF themselves) on October 7 as a crime of ethnic hatred. In fact, this belies a complete ignorance of the social and historical context which plainly shows Israel to be the primary aggressor in this entire situation. Moreover, it is the Likkud which is doubling down on its dehumanization and racial hatred of Arabs, to justify killing tens of thousands of innocent Palestinian civilians. They are the ones who have eliminated all peaceful and secular expressions of Palestinian resistance. There is no one responsible for the deaths of Oct 7 but the Israeli regime itself."
"Is that example really inherently antisemitic though? I don’t agree with the sentiment but if you take religion completely out of the argument and leave everything else, including the massacre, someone could still say the exact same thing. If any other country colonized an entire nation, forced the vast majority of its residents into an open air prison, continuously forced families not in said prison out of their homes to make way for ‘better’ people and regularly killed and imprisoned civilians including children for extended periods without trial there are people who would still make the argument that that a terrorist attack from the oppressed people on their oppressors that got the world actually talking about their 75 year plight is “progress” for the oppressed people. 

Again, not agreeing with what Hahn said but if instead of talking about Israel and Palestine we were talking about a Christian or Muslim nation actively colonizing another country and doing all the things that Israel is currently doing to the Palestinians the exact same thing Hahn said about the attack on Israel they could say about that nation."
"It’s honestly ridiculous that people don’t pause and think for a moment on this. The occupier happens to be Jewish. Palestinians didn’t choose for their oppressors to be Jewish. Whether you condone or condemn the attack on Oct 7th, it wasn’t an attack on Jews.. it was an attack on Israeli occupiers. 

Yes it was atrocious.. but it wasn’t an attack on Jews."

"If the only way Israel can exist is by violently stealing land, then it does not have a right to exist.
Exist on land that is freely given or don't exist at all.

"The state of Israel actually did engage in ethnic cleansing during it's founding in 1948. It used as series of military orders, property laws, and eminent domain laws from the British era as a way to engaged in the forced population transfer of Palestinians to achieve demographic dominance in the region. That is spoken of both the human rights reports of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. It's also spoken about by Yitzhak Rabin in his Memoirs that he published in 1977 where he speaks of the expulsion orders he carried out in the towns of Lydda where the military forcibly removed 50-70,000 Palestinians and then settled Jewish immigrants in there place. 

And the state of Israel is also engaged in Apartheid. Apartheid is not just a system that applies when it comes to one's domestic policies. Apartheid is also something that applies to territories that one occupies as well. The Geneva Conventions recognises this in its protocols and that was also something done by Apartheid South Africa itself when it practised Apartheid not just in it's own territories internally but also externally in African countries it occupied such as Namibia. 

When you look at the checkpoint system that requires passes for Palestinians it is similar to the pass system of Apartheid South Africa. When you look at the policies of home demolitions combined with the construction of settlements on top of those demolished homes that is very similar to the home demolition policies practised as part of urban apartheid at the time. When you look at the division of spaces into Area A, B and C with the Palestinian authority having some autonomy but not full sovereignty that is similar to the Bantustan system that South African ran."
‘Preemptive Self Defence’
"The sign reads: [BOMBING CHILDREN = COWARD 75 YEARS OCCUPIERS ""SELF-DEFENCE""]

It was clearly calling-out the often repeated claims by the IDF and their supporters, that any and all bombing is done so out of self-defence. 

I'm struggling to determine how you could logically read that as trying to justify the 7 October Hamas raids."
"To counter your point, every single protracted conflict, including the two you listed, were initiated by Hamas through violence on Israelis.

I'm not denying the longstanding existence of pro-Palestinian protests, but the original point of them typically following violence against Israelis also holds true."
You are completely missing what he was saying. Why was there one immediately after a terrorist attack?
You have to ignore a large portion of reality to believe this.
No. Actually there are a ton of jews at the protests. Many jews are against Zionism.
"No. We are protesting the continuing genocide of innocent Palestinian children. Yes, what happened required a response, but not what the IDF is currently doing."
Maybe if hamas spent a dime on shelters for people in Gaza there wouldn't so many deaths. Meanwhile isreal actually cares for their citizens.
And what about Syria or Yemen? Hundreds of thousands have been killed there over the past couple years. Never see a protest for it
Why is this so hard for right wingers to grasp? I was dreading Israel's retaliation more when October 7 happened. Anyone who knew their history knew that they would have no problems killing thousands more in response.

"This! I can’t imagine the fear and hopelessness of the hostages’ family members. If my baby was taken and I didn’t know if he was sleeping or eating or being treated well would be unimaginable. 

Equally, I cannot imagine the tragedy of the Palestinians and how they are living in constant fear, trying to put their babies to bed in the noise and chaos around, losing loved ones in the most horrific ways. 

Anyone who feels different at either end is just inherently not a good person."
"We've lost our humanity because of... religion? 

People need to think about how they felt when they lost someone close to them.  That's exactly how Palestinians and Israelis feel every day. No one deserves that."
"Because israel didn't blow 5,000 kids apart in a matter of weeks yet genius"
Things “ramping up” now shouldnt be “ramping up” in *favor* of a constituency that ELECTED hamas lol.
Israel hadn't even responded to the attack and people were already out celebrating
Israel hadn't even had time to respond to the Oct 7 attacks and people were already out celebrating
"That's quite disingenuous. This has been one of the most documented conflicts in history, and you can find plenty of articles over the decades cataloging the wrongs on both sides."

It’s currently a situation without an easy solution, everyone screaming in the streets about it, without knowing anything about the region or the people beyond what they read on an instagram powerpoint last week, need to seriously back off and reevaluate what they’re actually protesting."
"On either October 7 or 8 (I don't remember the exact date), I saw photos and videos of group of young men riding in the back of a pickup truck within a Toronto suburb. Maybe up to 30 in the box of the truck. They were ABSOLUTELY in a state of celebration. Their demeanor clearly indicated they were not advocating  or calling for peace; it was devoid of any somber mood or a sense of foreboding. It was evident that they had little foresight regarding the potential dire consequences, affecting not only Israelis but also Palestinians. That's what I don't understand. October 7 was horrific either way you look at it. It was an awful day for Israelis. It was an awful day for Gaza as it would lead to so much death and destruction."
"That's the thing. The kids there have no future BUT to fight Israel. Their lives have been made hell and the only way out they see is them reclaiming Palestine. Hamas isn't an organization that can be stubbed out, it's an ideology that's been beget by Israel's apartheid. 

I just find it so disappointing that Justin Trudeau stated that he SUPPORTS Israel when it's openly committing a genocide. Bombing Gaza will only prepare more boys willing to fight Israel in the future. We should never support any nation that indiscriminately bombs civilians. Be it Hamas or Israel - both are the same."
"First big step? The citizens of Gaza to wave a white flag, and force their brothers in arms to surrender as well to stop the invasion and deaths. Hamas needs to be ousted from within, first. 

Then it can be replaced by a UN mandated peacekeeping force (who? Who will send their troops? Nepal and Bangladesh....)."
"This is what lost me to the Palestinian cause. I grew up in the middle east and experienced some of the anti-non-believer rhetoric even though I'm Muslim (not all of my family is)   
There are Israelis you'll find that a replused by their government and deplore violence in their name.

In all my time living in the Muslim world, I can say that this sentiment is rare especially among Arab Muslims."
"I find it hard to believe *everyone* at these rallies were celebrating the deaths of 1400 people.

E: None of your responses really confirm that everyone at these rallies is cheering on the death of 1400 people.  Guilty by association is a pathetic excuse.  

Still no confirmation that *everyone* at these rallies did.  Feelings over facts appears to be the mood today."
"Who do you mean by ""they"" exactly? 

Surely you don't mean all Palestinians, a nation of over 14 million, nor all activists who sympathize with the Free Palestine Movement? Because that would be a really ignorant and simple take."

"The hostages probably need to be returned before it will even be a consideration, though I doubt most made it through the first night."
"If Hamas wasn't terrorists garbage that would go right back to murder and rape the *second* there's a cease fire we probably could have one right now...

Everyone calling for a cease fire is treating Hamas like a normal nation that follows rule and not the terrorist scum that they are."
">the civilian death toll on Palestinian side is over 10k

Correction: the death toll is 10k. Period.

We have no idea what portion of that is civilians vs Hamas militants because the Gaza Health Ministry (aka Hamas) doesn't differentiate.

We also don't know how accurate it is. Historically their numbers are more or less in line with what Israel and international observers report, but then again we also had them report 500 killed in an Israeli strike on a hospital that turned out to actually be a failed rocket that hit the parking lot and killed maybe dozens. Which reminds me...

We have no idea how many of those killed were actually killed by Israeli strikes vs failed rockets. There are hundreds of rockets fired from Gaza that fall short and land in Gaza, and we have no way of knowing how many are killed by those."
"The British killed a lot more Germans during WW2, does that make what they did wrong? Do you get immunity if you’re a terrorist group and you hide among your civilians? … oh ok, we can’t retaliate because they’re violating the Geneva convention and using human shields. I guess we just wait then…"
"The numbers don’t matter. If we wanted it to be completely fair then Israel could have invaded and picked 10 apartment buildings at random to rape and murder everyone inside. That would be equal. That would also be violence for the sake of violence.

The magical number we are looking for is zero Hamas members remaining alive. Civilian casualties are a sad consequence but the actual number doesn’t matter."
"How about Hamas, like, surrenders?"
"If you allow hamas to exist in perpetually, they can cause 100k+ deaths."
"That's where western and eastern thinking don't mesh very well. The mindset of ""Israel is doing this in revenge"" is not really the Israeli mindset, but it is the Palestinian mindset. Israel is trying to get Hamas to surrender (ideally) or destroy the organization. To them this is eliminating a security risk. If the Israeli goals could be achieved with zero Palestinian casualties that would be fine with the Israelis."
No the number of civilians is unknown because the associated Press who ran the 9000 number clearly states that Hamas has not clarified how many were combatants and how many were not.
"You should ask Hamas that question. They could surrender, release the hostages to enable a ceasefire and save their people. What was their plan to look after the people of Gaza (as their government) when they planned the Oct 7th attack? Why is nobody asking the government of Gaza to step up put their people first and take responsibility?"
Condemning Hamas is like condemning the Taliban or ISIS; they don't fucking care.

"« Palestinian s voted for Hamas. »

The majority of the Gaëtan population in 2023 weren’t even BORN when Hamas held the last election.

In 2008."
17 years ago Hamas won a slim majority in a region that is now mostly populated by people that are too young to have voted in that election.
"I believe  that  phenomena is called ""people having a different opinion from you""."
I could scarcely come up with a more histrionic example.
"The expectation that Palestinian supporters start ANY sentence with a condemnation for Hamas is disingenuous. People who demand this don't actually care about condemning war crimes and crimes against humanity.

If they did, they would ALSO start any sentence with ""Israel poisoning Palestinian wells is wrong"", ""Israel protecting IDF soldiers who rape girls and women is wrong"", ""Israel using white phosphorous on civilians is wrong"", ""Israel welding shut the front doors of Palestinian homes in the West Bank is wrong"", ""Israel making Palestinian people with Israeli work permits wear a numbered and colored badge on them is wrong"", ""Israel making specific streets illegal to walk on if you're Palestinian is wrong"", ""Israel holding women and children in prisons without trial or sentence is wrong"", ""Israeli top level officials saying Palestinians are little snakes and yelling «Death to All Arabs» is wrong"", ""Israel making Ethiopian Jews unable to have offspring without their consent is wrong"", ""Israel desecrating and harvesting organs from Palestinian bodies is wrong"", ""Israel proposing nuking a territory that's home to millions is wrong"", etc.

But they don't. And probably never will. Because there's a double standard."
No one is celebrating the death of civilians.
"A few dozen or few hundred psychos celebrating mass murder does not represent the whole nation, nor does it deligitimise Free Palestinian thought.

I have seen videos of some Israelis celebrating the deaths of civilians, but that does not give people the grounds to impugn all Israelis."

Palestine could in fact free themselves from Hamas, they actively choose not to. Thats the part that doesn't fit the narrative nobody likes to admit.   
On the other hand living in fear of your neighbour ratting you out to the local terrorist gang leader is also a factor in the social order both there and here... another thing nobody like to admit."
"Killed 5,000 more children?"
"I’m saying that the initial action of terrorizing and killing of 1,400 innocent Israeli civilians should have never been undertaken and that it was a catalyst that lead to results we’re observing right now.

"If Israel can stop indiscriminately bombing and killing  innocent civilians, illegally occupying properties, illegally detaining children maybe just maybe people can change their minds on jews.

Jews need to clearly separate themselves from Zionist government and actions they take.

It's been going on for 70+ years. Enough is enough."
"You might want to read up on your history then.
In 1948 the UN fully intended to split up Palestine into states. One Jewish the other Palestinian. Right from the get go the Palestinians refused to allow a Jewish state to be close to them. And the minute Israel declared independence they attacked. 
They attacked simply because they were Jewish. 
Fortunately for Israel despite the superior numbers of the Arab aggressors they couldn’t fight worth a damn. And now here we are today. The grandchildren of those people carrying on the same fight. All because they refuse to recognize that Israel has just as much right as Palestine to exist."

"Palestinians VOTED for Hamas whose stated goal was eradication of Israel and genocide of the Jews. The children are the responsibility of the Palestinians not mine. If you engage in terrorism, I cannot help you from the consequences of your own choices. 

If Palestinians wanted to get rid of Hamas they have to fight it. You can go there and fight them too if you want. If Palestinians fight Hamas directly Hamas will kill 100s of 1000s of Palestinians in one go. So it is better if Israel attacks Hamas which will result in lesser casualties of Palestinian civilians.

It was Palestine who rejected 2 state solutions.

>Between Israel and Palestine, only one 'side' is successfully carrying out an ethnic-cleansing campaign against the other.

If Israel wanted to eradicate Palestine, they have all the technological capabilities to do so. But Hamas tries to bomb Israel routinely. The only reason Israel is safe is because it has the Iron Dome and other tech to protect itself. Hamas spends the money given to it on terrorism instead of uplifting the lives of Palestinians."

And that the other worst-ranked countries just so happen to be Middle Eastern ones surrounding Israel?

Tel Aviv has a giant gay parade each year and is seen as one of the gay capitals of the world. LGBTQ rights are widely accepted by the majority of the Israeli population.

"> They want to bulldoze Gaza and turn it all into Israel.

This is simply not true. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, removed all of the Jewish settlers, and even removed all of the dead bodies of Jews from Gaza."
"Literally sharing lies.

Israel withdrew entirely from Gaza in 2005. There are no settlements in Gaza and the official
Israeli policy from 2005 to Oct 7 was Gaza belonged to Palestine.

If that changes, it is because Gaza can’t stop attacking israel"
Which part of the land is occupied?
Ya point taken -- Hamas' terrorist attacks against civilians was wrong and should have been opposed. The problem was many groups did not denounce this.
"It's fine to call them both horrible, but to celebrate and justify October 7 as Hahn did is absolutely antisemitic."

And while the rest of your argument uses a lot of charged language (oppressors, colonizing, open air prison etc) on its own I don't think it's antisemitic. But a lot of folks go past that and effectively question whether Israel has a right to exist in the region."
"Not an attack on Jews, eh? Hamas Charter:

The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree, (evidently a certain kind of tree) would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews."" (related by al-Bukhari and Moslem).

"You are very naive. You need to educate yourself about Israel-Palestine matter before drawing simplistic analogies.

Hamas whose stated objective is to eradicate Israel and genocide its people was elected to power by Palestinians there. 

When Palestinians shout ""from river to sea"", they mean the genocide of Israel."
"No Israeli wants to give up their homeland and let Hamas terrorists genocide them.

What you are engaging in is bad faith argumentation tactics. Sorry will not work here."
Israel is the homeland of the Jews. To eradicate Israel means to genocide Jews. Period.
Israel has always existed there. They were violently thrown out and have reclaimed what was always their.
"I was talking about Gaza and general Israeli society. What’s happening in the West Bank is almost completely Israel’s fault. That being said, muslims do have rights in Israel that are (on paper & in practice) the exact same as Jews. Obviously systemic racism exists, but it does everywhere else in the world."
"You said that they did engage in ethnic cleansing. Ignoring the fact that it’s because multiple countries declared war on them, it’s been 75 years since they did. Plus, you don’t see hate for Muslim countries doing this to Jews.

And, wtf r u saying about apartheid? You need a passport to enter Israel if you’re Palestinian because you need to cross a damn border. Is America committing apartheid against Canada?"
I'm struggling to determine how you could logically read that as me trying to justify the  October 7 Hamas raids.
Hamas bombed children with a missed middle strike.
"That's a more complicated point. From my perspective, it simply doesn't matter who started it. I only care about how it ends.

But, even to that point, it depends what you mean by ""started"". 

The 2021 conflict is a good example. Israel illegally occupies Jerusalem and is in the process of evicting Palestinians from their homes. Palestinians protest and throw rocks at the police. Police forces raid and occupy the Al- Al-Aqsa mosque, injuring hundreds. Hamas gives an ultimatum, stating that they will fire rockets unless the police forces leave the mosque. Israel doesn't capitulate. Hamas fires the rockets. Israel launches a campaign of airstrikes, killing hundreds and destroying significant amounts of infrastructure.

Almost all historic conflicts follow this pattern. A single issue keeps getting escalated by both sides, back and forth. And eventually, since neither side de-escalates, Hamas is launching unguided missiles and Israel is mass bombing civilians."

It's the same people who somehow became infectious disease experts at the start if covid."
"There are some Jews at the protests this weekend. There was not a single Jew at the ""protests"" that took place immediately after the massacre in Israel ."
"Which is?  Hamas puts military infrastructure in/under/beside hospitals/schools/mosques.  That is a war crime.  Hamas prevents or discourages evacuations because the more deaths the more Israel looks bad; they know they can't militarily defeat Israel, they must defeat Israel in the court of global public opinion.  This has always been the tactic; do something super heinous to Israel like Oct 7 then wait for Israel's outsized response, then cry victim. Rinse and repeat.

But don't the Pals want peace?  I don't know, maybe, but they voted for Hamas (who promptly cancelled future elections just like ever other despot-run Muslim country in the hood).  Israel has a right to exist and most Muslims since forever have not respected that, either side is happy to genocide; From the River to the Sea isn't the song of peace you may think it is."
Protest Hamas…they are shooting their guns from behind Palestinian children. On the weekend there was footage of Hamas shooting at the IDF from a hospital. What is the IDF supposed to do? Just eat the shots? Hamas are the baddies.
"Dude hamas is a terrorist organization. Their whole ideology benefits from dead palestians killed by foreign weaponry. You can't put logic/compassion behind terrorist ideology. They are in it for mass destruction, not civil or peaceful talks. Thus, they use this situation to bolster their message and further terrorist acts."
Exactly.
Start them up if you're just going to complain about it not happening. Or are you just trying to use whataboutisms?
You aren’t paying attention.
"Exactly. No one cares. I've obviously paid attention, but even our Canadian government doesn't even mention the Uyghurs to China, it's as if no one cares? We did participate in the carpet bombing of Syria with Barack Obama, but eventually pulled out of that campaign, still crickets there whenever it's mentioned."
"We are not allies with Syria or Yemen, we don't send them money, and we don't sell them arms.

The Canadian government supports Israeli so Canadian protests make sense.

Why would the Syrian government care about protests in Canada?

You can't seriously not understand this, can you?

A reply instead of downvoting basic facts would be a nice change of pace.

Edit: forgot we sold the saudis arms, we did protest it though as well, point stands

Also just learned that we flew Israeli reservists back to Israel on CAF planes on government dimes.

We are literally transporting Israel soldiers on our military flights for them."
**What about** them?
">so hard for right wingers to grasp?

What does right-wing have to do with this? It's about hypocrisy.  


More than 85,000 Yemini children died under the nose of Muslims. That's 21 times more than what's happened in Gaza. 30,000 children were killed in the Syrian conflict, that's nearly 8 times more than what's happened in Gaza.  


4,000 Palestinian refugees were slaughtered in the Syrian civil war.  


Lebanon banned Palestinians from working as doctors, or lawyers or from owning land.  


The Palestinian authority tortures Palestinian prisoners.   


Palestinian police murdered a journalist for opposing their government.   


850,000 Palestinians were displaced in the Syrian civil war.   


Lebanese militants killed 2,500 Palestinians in refugee camps and displaced and displaced another 30,000 Palestinians.   


Hamas dragged the dead bodies of innocent Palestinians through the streets of Gaza.  


Hamas hid weapons in Palestinian children's schools, and recruited children to become Jihads.  


Hamas murdered the last Christian pastor in Gaza.   


Hamas stole food, water and other humanitarian aid from their people to fund terrorism.  


Neighbouring Arab states refuse to accept a single Palestinian refugee, even temporarily.  


Nobody came out for these children in London, Paris, New York, Sydney, or Toronto. None of these Muslim influencers started any trend like we are seeing now.  


If you are only outraged by Israel's actions, then you are not pro-Palestinian, you are anti-Israel."
You think this war started in October of 2023?!
No I was upset. I'm not confused by my own empathy.
They haven’t. Why do you trust Hamas self reporting numbers?
"A populace of mostly underage children and young adults who weren't even alive or had a say when Hamas was elected, but go off."
[removed]
Half the people in Gaza weren't alive in 2006 and saying they elected Hamas without even touching on the Bush admin's actions and the coup is caused shows you either don't know the details of the conflict or are purposefully leaving things out.
Elected in 2006 when it was filled and run by different people. The average age is 18 in Gaza. Like 5% of people in Gaza right now voted for Hamas almost TWO DECADES ago. Fuck this “you voted for this” nonsense when the terrorists were babies at the time of the election.
No they weren’t. We all remember the days after October 7th and people were horrified. Like overwhelmingly horrified. It was like 9/11 where everyone agreed something was bad and that good will only lasted a week before Israel started to do war crimes.
"A protest is now a celebration?

They were protesting the Israeli response, which is always to kill around 10x the death by rule of thumb, like this one will be much bigger.

Sorry dude, the country dropping millions of dollars of missiles on children are in fact....  not the victims here....."
"That’s with Hamas in power in Gaza. Once Hamas is gone and UNRWA is no longer bound to their rules, I have high hopes. Who else is left? Israel? Palestinians don’t trust them, US? Nope, Americans are skeptical of another foreign prop up that could fail like Afghanistan. Russia? Iran? Lol."

This was mississauga. Posted 12:43am. I believe the attacks happened at 6:30am Isreal time, which is 6 hours ahead. So less than 15 minues later people are openly celebrating a terrorist attack."
"I’ll just leave this here as a way to answer your question

The Palestinian people do not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct ""Palestinian people"" to oppose Zionism. Yes, the existence of a separate Palestinian identity exists only for tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa, while as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan.

https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Zuheir_Mohsen"
Many Palestinians no longer want peace with Israel. They want their country back and the Israelis out. It's akin to Ukrainians celebrating the bombing of Moscow.
"Yes, one instance, hours after the attack, men only in that truck."
"I don't think people have any idea how bad their existence is. There is no positive future for Palestinians in the near future. They have literally nothing. With half of all Palestinians being under 18, literally half of their population knows nothing but war. I hate this analogy but what do people think would happen if you corner an animal? It'll just decide to be nice?"
"There’s no apartheid. 20% of Israeli population are Palestinians and they enjoy citizenship and government representation. They’re present in all Israeli cities. Gaza and the west bank are not recognized nor controlled by Israel (except those settlements that even I, who sympathizes with Israel more oppose ). Arabs with Israeli citizenship are even exempt from the IDF draft, they can volunteer but they won’t be required to serve. Israel treats Gaza like a separate country they’re at war with, not a rebellious province they’re trying to get back."
Why did these protests start the same day of the attacks before Israel even responded and started bombing Gaza then?
"They were chanting ""700"" when that was still the confirmed death toll. They didn't even wait until the end of the massacre to celebrate."
"It's kind of like alt-right and anti-vax being surrounded by literally nazi's. Like if this is the crowd you choose, you probably at least accept their beliefs.

So even if you aren't a direct supporter, you are an enabler.

If they don't support Hamas, they could join the Canadian Iranians in solidarity against extremist regimes. I'm sure they'd have a lot of empathy for them if they were willing to denounce religious extremism as bad."
"""If 9 people are at a table with a Nazi...""


If they weren't welcome at the rally they should have been kicked out. Right-winger were rightly called out for having too many fascist flags at their marches. The Pro-Palestine movement isn't immune to being called out for bigotry"
[deleted]
I mean weren't some of these rallies put on by the Palestinian youth society? And they were celebrating based on their posts? So even attending a protest/rally put on by this group would be aligning yourself with them. It's not like this is just someone who tagged along but literally the group that organized some of these are the people celebrating.
Not at all! Most people there have probably been seeing the dead children and traumatized children on the news and want it all to stop!
"15minutes after the attack was reported, people in my area rallied praising the attacks.

"*I don't condone murdering innocent people. My friends do. The hosts of the protest I'm apart of do. So I lend my support as another body. But they aren't my values*

You don't see a problem with that? These rallys were initiated by Hamas, and celebrates the deaths from Oct 7. They are protesting over a terrorist state, with a terrorist group as the ruling party, being destroyed by the country they invaded. If these people want a ""free palestine"" they should be in support of the terrorist groups being overthrown.

In WWII there were German resistance groups who worked against the Nazis. They worked with the Allies to overthrow their government. If these people wanted liberated lands they'd understand it starts by removing your government. They aren't protesting for Palestinians to rise up against Hamas. They're protesting for the counter assault to end."
"If you have 1 Nazi welcome at a dinner and 9 other people, you have 10 Nazis"
Some? Lots? Most? Almost all?
I very obviously meant the protestors
"The people chanting 700 when that was the confirmed death toll, the people chanting gas the Jews, the people marking Jewish owned shops and homes, hate crimes against Jews launching on the same day the terror attack happened"
"""Jewish advocacy group the Anti-Defamation League reported last week that antisemitic incidents had risen by about 400% in the two weeks following the Oct. 7 attack, compared with the same period last year.""

https://www.reuters.com/world/how-surge-antisemitism-is-affecting-countries-around-world-2023-10-31/

I would say not just celebration of the deaths but actively stoking flames for more deaths."
I guess chants of Gas the Jews and chanting 700 at Jews to taunt them is not celebrating civilian deaths
That’s bullshit. Clear and evident bullshit.
Lies. Stop spreading lies.
"Reported by the Times of Israel. Congratulations you've shown Israel has a free press and the ability to criticize the far-right without getting murdered


>The Saturday night gathering was meant to counter a much larger left-wing demonstration in favor of ending the conflict in Gaza and resuming peace talks. Several thousand left-wing activists had gathered in Tel Aviv’s Rabin Square, where they were calling for an end to bloodshed in the Gaza Strip and a return to negotiations with the Palestinians


>Hundreds of far-right activists participated in the counter-rally at the scene, with police fanned out to prevent altercations between the two sides"
"This.

Their mandate isn't prosperity for their people. Their mandate is elimination of the state of Israel.

A sad point that a lot of people have been conveniently ignoring - it's baked into the ""Palestinian"" identity that they'll get their ""land back"", and are willing to die for the cause. The ones who accepted a two state solution, or were okay with sharing their land with Jews are now known as Israelis and Jordanians."
"Both Hamas and IDF, under Neanyahu, are terrorists. The only side open to peace is fatah in the west bank"
"The one good thing of the entire Gaza hospital snafu is that it's forced the media to label the Gaza health-authority for what it is. aka the Hamas health authority.

That being said, war is brutal and I'm holding out hope that Israel is able to wipe Hamas out quickly to minimize the loss of life on both sides."
Also it seems that Hamas has killed civilians on the roads heading south to prevent them from moving to safety.
"I'm sorry but the WW2 analogy is laughable. Israel is occupying Palestine, not the other way around. Israel is an apartheid state where Israelis have rights and Palestinians don't. Its been this way for decades"
"And the Germans killed how many Jews, Roma, Russians?

Israeli ministers have called Palestinians ""human animals"". Think about that for a second and wake the fuck up.

This Britian vs Germany WWII anecdote you're using is void of any critical thinking."
You do realize that by killing and murdering the parents of these children they are in turn adding to the amount of people who will likely join a resistance group in the future? Killing 400 civilians to kill one hamas member seems like VERY poor planning……
"Actual number does matter. All the civilians who will die will brew hatred towards Israel and this cycle will continue . You can never have zero Hamas when your invasion kills innocents which turn into Hamas 2.0 .

Are people this naive ? God damn"
This is utterly evil.
"Well it will be nice to have 0 Hamas members but our Israeli friends seem to love funding them and indiscriminate bombing on a civilian population who aren't even old enough when Hamas was voted in will definitely make them love Israelis all of a sudden. 

Numbers clearly only matter on the Israeli side. 

Also the amount of Palestinian deaths to settlers in the west bank where there is no Hamas is something to think about but clearly some numbers don't matter. Whether it's 60 or a 100 old or young women or men if it's in Gaza or the west bank well I guess they are just numbers."
"That's not how you get rid of Hamas. Israel is only breeding hatred for themselves. All those young boys with dead fathers, mothers, or siblings will grow up as willing fighters against Israel. It's a cycle. 

Development and acceptance are key to ending the cycle. End the apartheid. Stop dehumanizing Palestinians and Arabs. Eventually it should just become one country. Call it Isreal-Palestine, get a new flag with a democratic government. Remove religion based citizenship.End the bloodshed. Drive acceptance or one another."
"Yeah you keep hearing from the anti isreal crowd about proportionate numbers. 

Think about what their principal implies: that if country a slaughters 100 civilians of country b then would it be justified for country b to slaughter 100 civilians of country a. Obviously not. All that country b is justified in doing is eliminating the threat whilst reducing unintentional civilian casualties."
"same energy as ""why don't Russia and Ukraine fight a war in fortnite"""
"These protestors are bothered by tens of thousands of civilian deaths that are almost assured.  They cant bring back the Israeli civilians who died no matter what they do but if they generate enough rage they might save countless thousands of civilians on the other side of the barbwire fence. 

Save who can be saved, you cant save the dead."
"Why? Why would any nation do this? 

You can't create millions of refugees and then vlame other countries for not cleaning up your mess."
"Feelings over facts, one might say."
Absolutely agree. However the bias is very apparent. I don't see anyone quoting the number of indigenous Palenstinan civilians killed over the past 75 years of Israel's brutal apartheid occupation of their land.
They nevertheless still have the support of the Palestinian people.
"The Internet is an echo chamber. It applies to any faction of any conflict.

But, to be fair, in real life, almost the entirety of people I know support Palestine. Even Jews."
The pro-Israel side genuinely seems to believe people should be deported for supporting Palestine. Not easy to have a civil discussion when your opponent thinks you shouldn't even be allowed to speak.
"And your reply is a perfect example of willful ignorance. 

Good luck /r/Canada"

"I don't think any reasonable person *doesn't* believe that actions can lead to other actions...

What people are taking issue with is the justification, or lack thereof, of the military response. A response which is killing innocent civilians indiscriminately, and rather vague in its effectiveness in destroying Hamas. At any rate, the regular people of Gaza are not responsible for the terrorism of Hamas. Collective reprisals/punishment against a civilian population, in retaliation against a political organ, is by definition a war crime -- there really isn't any room for negotiating this. 

As for your comment about ""rallying in support for change"", you'd be surprised how much the Israeli government and occupying forces are unmoved by peaceful protest. My friend, the Gazans [literally tried this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%932019_Gaza_border_protests), and they got fired upon for it.

You can also look at events in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem to understand the Israeli indifference to peaceful protest. The Palestinian Authority there has taken a stance of non-violence for decades now, and they are still being ethnically cleansed by Israel. They're being evicted from their farms and homes to make way for Israeli settlers, they have less rights, they are segregated into ghettos etc.

Were you not aware of these events?

All of that is not to justify Hamas' actions on 7 Oct, I'm outline that the Israel does not have a track-record of engaging with peaceful overtures/protests in good-faith."
"I see.. so it's ok for me to go around with a ""Throw all Muslims to the trash"" sign because not all the Muslims are calling against Hamas, ISIS, Hezbollah, Taliban and the Syrian regime, who are killing innocent civilians, sometimes even their own peolple, beheading babies and blowing up busses.

Only when it comes to Israel, the Jewish people are always called oppose it. Why is no one calling the Muslim community to take action against governments in the Arab countries?

230,224 civilians, including 30,007 children and 16,319 women (adult female), were killed at the hands of the parties to the conflict and controlling forces in Syria between March 2011 and March 2023. WHERE ARE THE RALLIES AGAINST THAT??

And btw, it's going on for more than 70+ years when the Jewish people were ran away from their homes in the Arab countries like Iraq, Syria, Egypt,  Yemen etc."

It's not antisemitic to oppose the idea of Israel as an ethno state of you oppose all other ethno states. Ethno states fundamentally cannot exist without discrimination and ethnic cleansing. How else are you going to artificially control the demographics of the place?
"Why would someone say that? 
I don’t think Palestinians want to raze Jews to the ground! And I don’t think they care if Jews had a homeland somewhere, they just want their home back! If Israel was created in Uganda 🇺🇬 as it was proposed, Palestinians wouldn’t mind that at all! Had israel been formed in Ararat city, Palestinians wouldn’t be going around chanting against Israel!"
"> Listen, Im not anti-semitic, I just don't think the Jews should have a single home across the globe and I think the current and only Jewish homeland and all the Jews inside it should be razed to the ground.

Do you have a link to someone saying this?"
This is definitely a super minority take anywhere you go online from pro Palestine people.

"If we went on what things were thousands of years ago damn near every country in the world would look dramatically different. 99% of Americans would have to leave their homes because the land previously belonged to the native Americans, do you believe that the vast majority of Americans should have to forfeit their homes? Should the Native Americans be allowed to force out and massacre the people whose relatives settled on their land more than 200 years ago because their ancestors were there first? They arguably have a far better claim to the United States and Canada then the Israelis do to Palestine given that the native Americans were forced from their land a couple of centuries ago as opposed to the idea the arabs colonized Israel/Palestine millenniums ago. 

Would the genocide of the innocent ancestors of those who originally colonized the Untied states be considered just because the land originally belonged to the native Americans?"
"That is quite literally the opposite of my argument. 

My whole point is that you can’t cleanse a land of people who have been there for generations based on the argument “well thousands of years ago my ancestors lived there”."

You might not like the source, but it points out that ""From the river to the Sea"" has also been used by Israeli politicians.

""Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party, which describes itself as conservative and nationalist, has been a staunch promoter of the concept of “Eretz Israel”, or the Bible-given right of the Jewish people to the land of Israel.

According to the Jewish Virtual Library, the party’s original party manifesto in 1977 stated that “between the Sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty”. It also argued that the establishment of a Palestinian state “jeopardises the security of the Jewish population” and “endangers the existence of the state of Israel”.

If there is to be a viable two state solution, it should I believe, include the recognition that independent countries are also geographic entities. Having Palestine or for that matter Israel divided geographically  makes for an solution that is untenable. A Palistine state divided into Gaza, the West Bank and parts of East Jerusalem doesn't make sense. On the other hand having Israel divided into two by Palestine also makes for long term conflict.

Maybe this was the original British plan."

"How so? All the Jewish people would die if Israel, as we know it (i.e. current borders, etc.), ceases to exist in its current form?"
"Jews don't need an ethnostate to exist. There are millions of Jews all over the world who won't keel over and die if Israel isn't a nation. Jews, Christians and Muslims are all indigenous to that region, and all are entitled to live there peacefully. Jews don't have sole claim to that land and they don't get to remove other indigenous peoples so that they can have it all to themselves."
All the Abrahamic religions originated there. Jews don't have a special claim to the area.
[removed]
"So because multiple countries declare war on Israel, that gives Israel the right to forcibly remove 800,000 people who have been living their for generations? Two things can be true at the same time. What the Arab regimes did was terrible. And what Israel did with it's forced expulsions, and yes, ethnic cleansing, is horrific. 

What I am talking about when speaking on apartheid is the military regime that Israel runs in the occupied territories. Engaging in home demolitions and then building settlements on top of those homes is a key feature of Apartheid which Israel is doing in the occupied territories. The restriction on the freedom of movement of the Palestinian people in the check point system is also a feature of apartheid that was practised in South Africa that Israel is practising right now. The fact that Israel has a segregated road system between Jews and Arabs is definitely a feature not just of Apartheid but just blatant segregation as a whole. That's what I'm talking about. And it's not just me. Many international human rights organisations such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, U.N human rights reports, as well as former anti apartheid activists in South Africa like the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu who with Nelson Mandela played a pivotal role in bringing down apartheid have stated that this is apartheid."
"I wasn't. Was your previous reply calling u/poverty_mayne comment a weird take, or something else?"
"I was defining starter as firing the first shots. However, I do not intend to paint Israel as 100% pure in the conflict over Sheikh Jarra. Hamas also incited violence in the demonstrations in support of the Palestinians under eviction (and rent) threat in Sheikh Jarrah. Followed by (very) heavy handed Israeli policing, Hamas fires rockets at Israel, which I would view as the beginning of where that conflict escalated into a war. However, in that specific case, I agree the ""who started it"" argument not hold much weight in terms of morality, I just wanted to make the point that the mass protests following Sheikh Jarra followed Hamas violence against Israelis, as did the current protests."
"""The 2021 conflict is a good example. Israel illegally occupies Jerusalem and is in the process of evicting Palestinians from their homes.""

The problem is you don't understand the issue either. The homes in Sheik Jarrah originally belonged to Jews who were ethnically cleansed by Jordan in 1948 out of the West Bank. Palestinians were given these homes.

In 67 Israel occupied WB and made a deal they could remain there so long as they paid the rent. They stopped paying rent in 2021, and that's why they were evicted.

Leaving out a pretty key detail there.

""Palestinians protest and throw rocks at the police.""

And fireworks, FROM INSIDE Al-Asqa, as encouraged by Hamas. Again leaving out a key detail.

 ""Police forces raid and occupy the Al- Al-Aqsa mosque, injuring hundreds. ""

They removed squatters who were planning to attack Jews praying below. They didn't occupy the mosque.

""Hamas gives an ultimatum, stating that they will fire rockets unless the police forces leave the mosque. Israel doesn't capitulate.""

Because Israel can't leave people with weapons to attack their praying civilians. 

You're really leaving out some important information for this conflict and making it seem like Israel is to blame, when Hamas really encouraged and started this violence in 2021."
"I am well aware of Sheikh Jarrah and I am well aware that it is not a simple conflict. My comment suggesting Hamas started that war was because they fired the first shots, not because I was suggesting that the Israelis were saints in that conflict."
There are always several jews at these protests. Jews are also protesting against Israel in the US and within Israel itself.
"The last election was in 2006. Hamas murdered the opposition. Only half the current population was even alive then. Half of them were children who couldn’t vote. Half of the current population is children. Do the math. Saying that anywhere near the majority of Palestinians chose this is absurd and incredibly disingenuous.

But Jesus… it’s always the exact same talking points from you guys. It’s like that bit John Oliver does where there are 100 talking heads saying the exact same thing. How do you not see that you are pawn in the propaganda wing of a genocidal war machine."

The Palestinian constituency still elected hamas dude. Thats very problematic."

And this is what gas lighting looks like folks. None of us saw news reports of celebrations in the streets on or shortly after October 7th. And if you did....uhhh...actually it was just AI generated images.
"Then what's this?

Police investigate pro-Palestinian protest at Sydney Opera 

https://www.reuters.com/world/police-investigate-pro-palestinian-protest-sydney-opera-house-over-alleged-anti-2023-10-10/

Australian police said on Tuesday they were investigating a pro-Palestinian protest outside Sydney Opera House, after footage emerged of a small group appearing to chant anti-Semitic slogans at the demonstration.

Around 1,000 pro-Palestinian supporters marched through downtown Sydney on Monday evening to the city's iconic Opera House, which the government had illuminated in the colours of the Israeli flag following Saturday's attacks by

Or this? Literally chanting the death toll 

https://www.timesofisrael.com/pro-palestinians-celebrate-hamas-attack-as-israel-supporters-rally-in-new-york/

Several hundred pro-Palestinian demonstrators rallied in Times Square, waving Palestinian flags and chanting “Resistance is justified,” “Globalize the intifada,” and “Smash the settler Zionist state.”

Or this literally being called a Pro Hamas rally?

">A protest is now a celebration


When they were on the streets Oct 7 before Israel had even responded? Yes, absolutely. 


>They were protesting the Israeli response, which is always to kill around 10x the death by rule of thumb, like this one will be much bigger


So they were protesting something that had yet to happen yet rather than protest the people who just got murdered? That's supposed to be better? 


>Sorry dude, the country dropping millions of dollars of missiles on children are in fact.... not the victims here.....


Good thing the civilian casualty ratio is less than. 1:1 right now which is far far far better than the average world conflict. Especially when Hamas is using schools and hospitals as military bases"
"but that’s exactly my point, there isn’t anyone. The UN is heavily reliant on in-country workers, most of the teachers and doctors working for the UNRWA are gaza palestinians. Saying “the UN can govern the area” just means that the local population, that have already been indoctrinated, would be put in a position to push their own values onto others once again. 


If not Hamas in control than it’s the PA or PIJ or LD or whoever else, all they need to do is apply to the UNRWA and that’s it, there’s no vetting and even if there was that’s not an easy process either. It’s not like you can monitor thousands of UN workers 24/7 to make sure they’re not engaging in terrorism. 



If your goal is to have an occupying force made up of UN workers, remember that Russia and Iran and very large members of the UN with a lot of influence and personnel. Iran was just named the chair of the human rights committee of the UN and they’re basically funding every anti-israel terrorist cell there is.


The UN is a forum for diplomatic discussions between nations and that’s it, anything outside of those bounds opens up doors for corruption so they cannot be put in charge.


This is why the issue is so complex, there is no simple solution."
"Thank you! That is exactly the scene  I was referring to but my memory was fuzzy,"
What country? It was never their country or even a country for that matter. Before the British took over post WW1 it was part of the Ottoman Empire and part of other empires before that.
"except Israel existed before Palestine, so pretty different"
I've heard a much much different account from my Palestinian friends that can't even visit their homeland. They get treated a lot worse in Israel than what Israel likes to portray.
The head of the Supreme Court is an Arab Muslim
"This goes back way before the past month, and everyone knew the response was going to be disproportional as always."
Who's they?  Can you be more specific on who exactly was chanting this?
"Way to dance around it, but okay, sure the movement isn't immune to bigotry.  I never said otherwise, I'm just saying I find your claim of *everyone* at these rallies celebrating these deaths to be incorrect, and you confirmed that in your own roundabout way."
"By that logic all Israelis who aren't actively protesting their govt actions should be blamed for them.

Edit: and kick them out how? This isn't a organized protest but a grassroots one., there's no organizers with a gate to check ppl before they show up or fencing to keep them out. We can't physically kick them out since that's assault. They also have as much right to ""proest"" as the other ppl do,"
"Sure, buddy."
">some

Yep."
"My reply still stands. 

Trying to delegitimize activists who want (a) a ceasefire or (b) emancipation of the Palestinian nation, because of the hot takes of a few people, is ignorant."
There are several jews at these protests....

"It’s not laughable. The German vs Britain anecdote has to do with the volume of tragic deaths, in reference to the comment above. The side that has the most deaths doesn’t necessarily mean that they are more moral or in the right.
And on another note, Israel is occupying Palestine? The Jews have lived there since the biblical times, over 3,500 years. Your occupation comment is laughable."
They called Hamas human animals.
"You have to eliminate the threat in the current moment. If they decide not to take any action, Hamas will continue to fire rockets until isreal runs out of iron dome missiles or face massacres like Oct 7. Yes there might be unintentional casualties that lead to radicalized youth but you have to weigh the pros and cons."
"Yes, people are that naive.

These people still think you can beat terrorism with bombs. It's like they forgot about Afghanistan and Iraq already."
"And the opposite is also true. With every atrocity, Hamas hardens opinion in Israel proving there can be no peace."
If Hamas 2.0 retains an iron fist on the population but stops firing rockets at Israel and invading them then job done. I don’t care about their internal politics i just want them to stop attacking their neighbours.
"Not true, why hasn't Germany elected a Hitler 2.0?

Also Hamas runs military training for children as young as 13. Hamas is responsible, not Isreal."
"It doesn’t matter. They would hate Jews regardless of whether israel wipes Hamas out or not.

The difference is: if israel allows its people to be butchered without a disproportionate response, it encourages a similar attempt in the near future.

That’s all"
"There is Hamas in the West Bank and they do occasionally fire rockets from the west bank. Saw a video of an attempted IED on a IDF convoy in the West Bank. 

Even the government in the West Bank (plo) have a martyrs fund where they pay the families of terrorists that attacked Israel. They had a budget of 26 million last year with 100+ government officials working in that department.

Even the moderate Palestinian party is pretty radical from our perspective."
"Yea how about no.

Really rich that you would propose Israel sacrifice their own safety and security for the enemy. If what your proposing actually happened we would see terrorist attacks skyrocket. 

Your asking for a far superior military power to lay down their weapons and put the safety and security of their enemy above their own citizens. LOL."
"At what cost?

Hamas has continued firing rockets every day. 

They've attacked *their own people* to prevent them from escaping.

They've directly and unequivocally stated that they will continue to try and commit attacks like Oct. 7th until no Jews remain.

Yes, a ceasefire may save some thousands of people *now*, but it dooms them to decades more under Hamas.

How many people does Hamas have to kill? How many times do they have to make their intentions clear before the world accepts the ugly truth that removing them by force is the only viable option in the long term?"
[deleted]
Why they don’t want to save hostages?
It's an Arab mess for attacking in 1948.
"That is exactly what happens all over the world- the Vietnamese boat people, the Tamil diaspora during the civil war, the refugees from the Syrian civil war, people fleeing the war in Ukraine."
[deleted]
Israel and Palestine had an opportunity to live side by side with each other in peace with the UN plan. Instead the Arab league rejected Israel and attacked. Most of Palestinian land that has been lost was by the Arab leagues offensive wars against Israel. If you wanna talk about 75 years of apartheid occupation it might be worth knowing how it started and got to be to that point. Oh and don't come back at me with historical it's one side land over the others since both have roots dating back to 800 BCE.
"What, including the West Bank and Palestinians abroad? What’s the source?"
"""even Jews"" reads like ""I have a black friend""

How many Jews do you know? Nearly every Jew I know has posted pro-israeli messages on socials. Flip side, many Arabs I know posted messages on October 7th and 8th praising the attacks. I wish I was kidding.

Interesting that your circles don't see the big picture."
"The overwhelming majority of Jewish people in Canada are pro Israel. That doesn't mean they don't have sympathy for Palestinians, or that they don't want a 2 state solution. But Jewish people understand the need for Israel and have been raised learning about the geopolitical context of the conflict far more than average internet trolls. 


I am anti settler, anti Netanyahu. But im not anti Israel and I believe Israel needs to root out hamas. I hope they can do it quickly while preserving as much life as they can."
"Real life echo chambers exist as well. As you say, almost everyone YOU know support Palestine but that isn't necessarily representative of the rest of the world outside your experience. Not saying most people support Israel, I don't know the statistics, but your experience does not equal fact."
"This is a dumb strawman. I haven't seen that at all from pro Israel activists.

The only people I've seen calls for ""deportations"" for are blatant Hamas supporters - people waving Hamas flags at Palestinian demonstrations, and people who immediately cheered the October 7th.

I'm sure there are people out there who are calling for it, but there have been dumb xenophobes for as long as we've had immigration."
Who was? Do you have any proof?
Can you name some examples in Canada?
I don't support Hamas. I'm anti-murdering innocents which seems to be a wild take nowadays.
So why are you crying so much when Israel gives them a helping hand with overthrowing the terrorist government?
"Yup. You nailed the simplified version. Got me. 
But then again , how long did the Afghan army and police force last after 20 years of support? Those people have deeply ingrained cultural issues that the west doesn't understand."
"So of the 10,000 people killed so far, half of which are children? Can you validate your claim somehow? I can’t find that statistic anywhere and assume it’s just an emotional assumption.."
"Even assuming that is correct: this is only because generations of Arabs have now seen that they cannot wipe Israel off the map. And now that Israel has spent the past 75 years both proving that they will NOT be removed and they WILL punish anyone who attempts genocide on their people, NOW they want peace. It’s gonna take a lot more than good thoughts for Israel to be able to trust their neighbours."
"I am not talking about gaza. I am talking about islam as a dangerous ideology that is quite oppressive. It has been hiding under a religious label but if you remove the religious label from it and treat it as a political party, everyone would see how oppressive it is"
I’m not Canadian so I don’t know what those places are. Oh yeah keep doing that. I like watching liberals suffer
"If it were just about alleged Israeli war crimes we would expect a similar response to the many indisputable war crimes in the region. 

For example Assad shelled neighborhoods with nerve gas. If you've watched the videos of what that looked like it's horrific. He's not Jewish though so no protests."
"You have not answered their arguments. One can deny anything & everything by pointing at the messenger. By the same token, you could argue that Russia, China, Hamas, etc. have never done any infraction of international law. You have to read the evidence, and then come to a judgement. Also, your second link is about Amnesty saying that Ukraine has endangered citizens by operating close to humanitarian infrastructures. Your description of the link does not match the content of the article. Now *I do not want to get dragged into a conversation about this, because I care about the arguments in the report on Israel's apartheid, not about you trying to do an ad hominem.* However, to me the ability to call out both sides of a conflict makes them more credible: international law applies to defendants as well. And you first link is about HRW reporting on themselves. Again, read the reports and stop trying to find ways around arguing about the actual arguments."
Saying someone is immoral doesn't make what he says wrong. You clearly don't understand the concept of sophism so please refrain from insulting other's intelligence.
Main stream media is not independent either.
"I just go by the facts and how the real world operates. Calling everyone who exposes Islamic terrorism and antisemitism as propagandists is a known tactic of terorrists and their sympathizers. It has lost its value.

It does not matter what the age is. Children are the responsibility of the parents. Palestinians VOTED for terrorists like Hamas who wanted to genocide Israel.

Right now there are 100s of 1000s of arabs all over protesting. But tell me how many arabs in the west were protesting against Hamas to free Palestinians? ZERO.

How many protests were held by arabs against the 20 million women in an open prison in Iran when they were fighting for their liberty?? ZERO.

But now that suddenly Hamas and Palestinian attacks and attempts to genocide Israel and the Jews are facing the consequences for their actions, all terrorists and their sympathizers want to claim that Hamas is not Palestine. You think people are idiots??

Your selective outrage to defend hamas and Palestinian terrorism does not fool anyone."
I think Israel has the right to exist. Do you think Palestine has the right to exist? The only side occupying everything from the river to the sea right now is Israel
"1000%.

While you ask me this. I hope you know what happened to Rabin."
"The media doesn't publicize it that's why.

Let me give you some proof. For a Muslim funeral prayers are a HUGE deal because the core of the religion is that this life is a test for the next, and that next life means everything.

You remember that guy in the London van attack? 
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/05/imams-refuse-funeral-prayers-to-indefensible-london-bridge-attackers

130 imams. Normally a mosque has one, at most two. That's a minimum of 60 mosques across the country not just condemning but standing up to say that this is not what a Muslim does and denying.

Acts like this are never really given publicity. I mean you know of the attack probably. But you never heard of this did you. Yet here is proof of it.

I can tell you every mosque during Friday prayer in the GTA (Friday prayers are like Sunday mass to Muslims), taught openly how this is not the way and diplomacy and conduct is the way to solutions. Not this. This is not news worthy because this part of a sermon. Every Friday prayer has a sermon. And the focus that day was that this is against our values.

Hinging your argument on condemnation is pretty weak. Should I ask you to condemn the recent attack in London where the guy ran over the Muslim family? I don't think that's fair. You didn't do it. You didn't encourage it. You didn't plan it. You didn't take part in it. 

Should I ask you to condemn the mosque shooting that happened in Quebec? Do we assume every Canadian is like this? No we don't. So why do you have a double standard? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_City_mosque_shooting

Do we ask you to condemn the Iraq war? Which by the UN was improper and we still don't have the nukes Sadam was supposedly hiding? Canada sent troops. Does that mean you are complicit too?

All this does nothing. This empty condemnation does nothing, worse it divides us.

Zoom out and see the bigger picture. The people protesting are doing so cuz they see the sequence. They see Hamas targetting average Israelis. They see IDF shooting up Palestinian children on the regular. They see the illegal settlements and they see the cycle. 

Even the Jews are protesting man. You want them to what? Condemn the October attacks? That's like dividing by zero. 

Look at the bigger picture. 38 Palestinian children killed BEFORE SEPTEMBER just this year. That's before. October. If someone shot your kid while you lived in Ontario and the bullet came from Quebec how'd you take it? What Hamas did is wrong. But you need to go further and see what the IDF is upto also, if you really want peace.

Peace should be the target. Not just condemnation."
"In the entire decades long Israel-Palestine conflict, fewer than 50,000 Palestinians (civilian and military) have died. As a comparison, at least 500,000 people died in the past 10 years of the Syrian civil war.

You can be angry about what’s happening to the Palestinians. But it’s not *genocide*. See also: the Palestinian population increasing continuously over time, to 600% of what it was in 1948."
"It's kind of crazy when people are like ""Oh you don't support genocide? But these people don't like you."" I couldn't care less. I'm trans. Genocide is bad. I don't support genocide."

"You make a good point and I have edited the comment accordingly, and I apologize for the emotionally driven comment."
"Fortunately Israel is not an ethnostate. 21% (~2million) Israelis are non-Jewish Arabs, 1.7 million of which are Muslim.

I do not believe that being an ethnostate is a prerequisite of being a safe homeland for the Jews."
"Many Palestinians do not. However, the terrorist group governing Gazan Palestinians openly declared their intention to first eradicate Jews in Israel and then across the globe, followed by the rest of the non-Islam religions."
"Most Israelis are actually of Sephardic background, due to the expulsion of Jews from Arab countries during and after WWII.

So by your own logic the Jewish home should be in an Arab country."
"While I believe I am understanding the point you are trying to make, I think it's validity relies on an incorrect assumption that the location Israel was founded on was just some random patch of land. The Jewish people are indigenous to the land, and were forced out of it into slavery, exile, or death. 

This is not to make a claim that the entire land should be handed to the Jews, as Arabs have also lived there more than long enough to also have indigenous claims to the land. As such, I believe a two-state solution is the only just way for this matter to be settled, even if that seems so impossible in the current heat of this war."
"I don't think that we as Jews are so special we need a country just for us.

First, while Israel is a land where Jews can be safe from persecution in perpetuity, it is not a solely Jewish state. Millions of Arabs live in Israel with the same rights as Jews living in Israel.

Second, while we as Jews are not special, the persecution we have faced over and over and over again throughout the millenia is extraordinary, and as of 1948, showed absolutely no signs of slowing down. Even after 1948, high profile situations such as the Prisoners of Zion in the Soviet Union continued to demonstrate the need for a Jewish homeland. Today, in 2023, the USA is facing [historic levels ](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/31/politics/fbi-director-antisemitism-wray/index.html) of antisemitism, further justifying the need for Jews to have a home they can go go where they can be safe."
">What do you think is so special about Jewish people that we need a whole country just for us?

Muslims and Christians have how many ethnostates?"
They gave people three weeks notice to get out of northern Gaza.
"There was never a country called ""Palestine"". Simply never existed. There was British Mandate Palestine, which might be what you're thinking of, but that was not a country and did not have citizens like modern countries do. There was also the Ottoman Empire, The Persian Empire, Israel, then Egypt. There is no history beyond Egypt."
"Palestine wasn’t even a proto state prior to Jewish migration. The Arabs never had anything resembling sovereignty over said land. They were basically feudal peasants under the Ottomans and subject to the laws of the Ottoman Empire. Even basic things like freedom of speech only really came in under the British. In the later stages of Ottoman rule, they were allowed to buy a small amount of private land. Jews then migrated there by buying land themselves.

In order for the Arabs to claim the entire region for themselves they have to have had something resembling sovereign control over the region which they never did, not for 400 years under the Ottomans.

"Celebrating October 7? What do you think triggered all of these ""protests""? It was what Hamas did on October 7. The ""protestors"" came out to celebrate before Israel even had a chance to respond."

People seriously think Zionism appeared out of the blue as some kind of “globalist plot” (the Hamas founding charter’s [original text](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp) is downright bemusing to read, here).

Here’s how Jews were treated in [19th century Persia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Benjamin):

1. Throughout Persia the Jews are obliged to live in a part of the town separated from the other inhabitants; for they are considered as unclean creatures, who bring contamination with their intercourse and presence.
2. They have no right to carry on trade in stuff goods.
3. Even in the streets of their own quarter of the town they are not allowed to keep any open shop. They may only sell there spices and drugs, or carry on the trade of a jeweler, in which they have attained great perfection.
4. Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity, and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt.
5. For the same reason they are forbidden to go out when it rains; for it is said the rain would wash dirt off them, which would sully the feet of the Mussulmans.
6. If a Jew is recognized as such in the streets, he is subjected to the greatest insults. The passers-by spit in his face, and sometimes beat him so unmercifully, that he falls to the ground, and is obliged to be carried home.
7. If a Persian kills a Jew, and the family of the deceased can bring forward two Mussulmans as witnesses to the fact, the murderer is punished by a fine of 12 tumauns (600 piastres); but if two such witnesses cannot be produced, the crime remains unpunished, even though it has been publicly committed, and is well known.
8. The flesh of the animals slaughtered according to Hebrew custom, but declared as Trefe, must not be sold to any Mussulmans. The slaughterers are compelled to bury the meat, for even the Christians do not venture to buy it, fearing the mockery and insult of the Persians.
9. If a Jew enters a shop to buy anything, he is forbidden to inspect the goods, but must stand at a respectful distance and ask the price. Should his hand incautiously touch the goods, he must take them at any price the seller chooses to ask for them.
10. Sometimes the Persians intrude into the dwellings of the Jews and take possession of whatever pleases them. Should the owner make the least opposition in defense of his property, he incurs the danger of atoning for it with his life.
11. Upon the least dispute between a Jew and a Persian, the former is immediately dragged before the Achund [religious authority], and, if the complainant can bring forward two witnesses, the Jew is condemned to pay a heavy fine. If he is too poor to pay this penalty in money, he must pay it in his person. He is stripped to the waist, bound to a stake, and receives forty blows with a stick. Should the sufferer utter the least cry of pain during this proceeding, the blows already given are not counted, and the punishment is begun afresh.
12. In the same manner the Jewish children, when they get into a quarrel with those of the Mussulmans, are immediately led before the Achund, and punished with blows.
13. A Jew who travels in Persia is taxed in every inn and every caravanserai he enters. If he hesitates to satisfy any demands that may happen to be made on him, they fall upon him, and maltreat him until he yields to their terms.
14. If, as already mentioned, a Jew shows himself in the street during the three days of the Katel (feast of mourning for the death of the Persian founder of the religion of Ali) he is sure to be murdered.
15. Daily and hourly new suspicions are raised against the Jews, in order to obtain excuses for fresh extortions; the desire of gain is always the chief incitement to fanaticism.

"Honestly a pretty vague sentiment... spans from Israel should reduce their settlement activity to 1967 borders to ""from river to the sea""..."
The siege is against Hamas. There are casualties in war.
Hamas also has members that wear eyeglasses. Does that mean everyone who wears eyeglasses supports hamas?
It’s well beyond the pale to morally equate an *Islamic Caliphate* — a term intricately linked with establishing a regressive global theocracy and asserting overt Muslim supremacy — to a tiny Jewish state and the LGBTQ capital of the Middle East with virtually no aspirations to expand its territory.

"Your phobia is that unless the IDF systematically suppresses and oppressed gaza and west bank hamas will rise up and attack.

 You are blind to the fact that 38 Palestinian kids were killed just this year BEFORE SEPTEMBER (which comes before October mind you) by the IDF. Where is the outrage for that?

Where is the outrage for this 2 yr old?
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-65812442


Look at his eyes. Imagine the fleet of bullets around him. This was before October. This is what the IDF does in the name of protection. Unless you think even toddlers are Hamas agents."
"Israel is a country now and the most powerful military in the region.

That doesn't mean you operate with ""well hamas says they'll wipe us out, so let's conduct our ethnic cleansing BEFORE they conduct their genocide"".

That's a stupid and oppressive way to function and it shows. That's exactly why even Jews are protesting.

The politics have changed. And the people who want to stop it will not gain any support. And trust me, I say that as a Muslim. 

The sole purpose of the protest is to show that it is not so simple to just condemn Oct 7. For a nation as rooted on education and technical it is on us to have an educated response. And anyone can see half the reason is IDF raising and killing with impunity along with the illegal settlements being at the heart of it.

But the Israeli government would rather push an agenda than actually serve it's own people.

It should make you wonder why even outside bibis house there was a protest.

It should make you wonder that if they can spot a hamas agent in a refugee camp and bomb it (war crime aside) how could they not tell there was a massing of militants right across the wall?"
"There are arabs living in Israel too.

Palestinians refugees got kicked out Kuwait because supported Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.

Palestinian refugees got kicked out of Jordan for throwing the king there."
"I see we’re going to overtly ignore the entire peace process rejected by most Arab Muslims in the region at every turn for the last century. Take [Camp David in 2000](https://archive.is/IotS2) for example:

> Throughout this horrible week, my mind has repeatedly flashed back to Dec. 23, 2000. That was the day the Palestinians were offered a path to having their own nation on roughly 95 percent of the land in the West Bank and 100 percent of the land in the Gaza Strip. Under that outline, Israel would also swap some of its own land to compensate the Palestinians in exchange for maintaining 80 percent of its settler presence in the West Bank.
>
> The Palestinians would control, in President Bill Clinton’s formulation, “Arab areas” of East Jerusalem. And on the most sensitive religious sites, there would have been divided sovereignty or jurisdiction, with Palestinians controlling the Haram al-Sharif (including the Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques) and Israel controlling the Western Wall and the holy space of which it is a part. There would also be a return of many refugees into the new Palestinian state (without the right of return to Israel itself).

Arafat walked out.

In addition, the Palestinians were unilaterally given [70% of Mandatory Palestine](http://www.mythsandfacts.org/replyonlineedition/images/maps/1922-mandate_for_palestine.jpg) in the form of Transjordan (now Jordan). The Peel Commission of 1937 then proposed the Palestinians get [80% of the remaining 30% of Mandatory Palestine](https://cdn.britannica.com/67/141467-004-C01ADE7B/Partition-plan-Peel-Commission-report-1937.jpg), bringing their total share of Mandatory Palestine to *94%*. The Jewish moderates accepted this proposal. The Palestinians *unanimously* rejected it.

In 1947, the UN proposed a partition plan which gave Jews 55% of the remaining 30% of Mandatory Palestine and the Palestinians 45%, bringing their total share of Mandatory Palestine to 84%. The Jews once again accepted the proposal. The Palestinians rejected it, and then launched a war of aggression against the Jews for the obvious purpose of ethnic cleansing.

And even then, despite all the animosity, Israeli leaders offered friendly Arabs full Israeli citizenship with equal rights. It’s literally written in Israel’s [Declaration of Independence](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/israel.asp):

> “WE APPEAL - in the very midst of the onslaught launched against us now for months - to the Arab inhabitants of the State of Israel to preserve peace and participate in the upbuilding of the State **on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its provisional and permanent institutions**

Now compare that to how Zuheir Mohsen, PLO leader described “Palestine” [in 1977](https://martienpennings.wordpress.com/2016/02/16/zuheir-mohsen-zuhayr-muhsin-zahir-muhsein-trouw-palestinian-people-does-not-exist/):

> “The Palestinian people do not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct ""Palestinian people"" to oppose Zionism. Yes, the existence of a separate Palestinian identity exists only for tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa, while as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan.”
>
> From: “Wij zijn alleen Palestijn om politieke reden,” James Dorsey, Trouw, 31 March 1977.

See the difference? One group invites the other to join them as equal partners, while one seeks to entirely *remove* the other — who just happen to be Jewish — from their area. 🤨

For context, here’s a map showing land ownership claims in Mandatory Palestine as of 1945: https://old.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/gcz4zr/mandatory_palestine_land_ownership_in_1945/"
It's not included in the copy/paste of his keyboard
Explain what?
"I am talking about common arabs in the west here shouting ""river to the sea"" calling for the genocide of Israel . Not some small fringe group.

Your false comparisons have no value here.

Palestinians have a problem. They went as refugees to Kuwait and were kicked out for supporting Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. They went to Jordan and were trying to overthrow the king there and were kicked out.

If arabs themselves cannot deal with these guys. then what can Israel do."
"Palestine has rejected 2 state solution multiple times.

even genocidal Arabs in the west are shouting ""from river to sea"" slogan calling for the genocide of Israel.  


Your pretzel logic to defend terrorists will not work here."
"That speaks to the generosity of Israelies. Every arab I have met only tries to shift the argument away from Hamas terrorism and tries to blame others.

Hamas was elected to power by Palestinians.

Tell me how many arabs in the west have protested against Hamas to help overthrow it and free Palestinians there.

Iran holds 20 million women in an open air prison and attacks them for not complying. How many arabs in the west protested against the 20 million held in an open air prison in Iran?

&#x200B;

But the day Hamas attacked Israel, we saw a lot of terrorists cheering in the west. pathetic.

I am very well travelled which is why I speak with such confidence."
How else will Israel cease to exist without killing all the Jews in there?
"Jews have always lived in Israel. Just because they were violently thrown out and attacked does not mean they cease the right to their homeland.

Arabs and Muslims have the entirety of middle east. Jews have ONE country in the world. Especially after the holocaust, it only reinforces the need for Israel, where the Jews have a safe space to call their own."
"Jews have always be there in Israel since 2000 years ago. It is their land.

Muslims did not even come into the picture till 700 AD."
"You’re right that what’s happening in the West Bank is wrong and deeply problematic. But… blockading a territory where the government would like to see your people dead and not allowing that same territory (which has started multiple wars against you) certain resources seems reasonable. 

Also, Gaza is Not an ethnic enclave. It’s a self governed country-esque state with 0 ties to Israel. The fact that it has an open border with Israel is a mild miracle considering their treatment of each other"
"I didn't realize israel claimed self defense


It appeared as though the pro hamas sign was claiming self defense"
I appreciate where you're at with your reasoning. It's a complex issue with escalation and bad actors on both sides. And good actors on both sides as well (speaking of Israelis and Palestinians broadly rather than their leadership)
As always the anti isrealis leaving out context and over simplifying the situation
"I would consider ethnic cleansing a provocation, the equivalent of firing the first shot."
"It's very frustrating how literally every time some event flares things up with Israel-Palestine, in comes a wave of people calling literally any criticism of Israel anti-Semitism.

There is indeed a lot of real anti-Semitism, throughout the Middle East particularly, but also in the rest of the world. Just because there is hate from them though doesn't mean every criticism is hatred.

Of course, the trick is that all of the western left-wing Jews — that have for decades condemned the actions of the Israeli government and settlers — actually hate Jews the most out of anyone because they're them new-fangled self-hating-Jews."
"So it's a good thing for the Palestinians that Hamas is going to be eradicated by Israel, right? They should be cheering them on, right?"
The Muslim Brotherhood thanks you for your continued support.
We literally sell arms and equipment to the Saudis
"We do supply weapons to the people who are slaughtering the Yemeni, though"
"I mean the deaths in Yemen were due to the conflict with Saudi Arabia, and we do send them weapons..."
"Ya I forget that, but statements were against the war not for it, and we did protest  that too

https://peaceandjusticenetwork.ca/canadastoparmingsaudi/"
"They also don't care that the successor to the Janjaweed, the guys who carried out the Darfur genocide, are about to take over Sudan. There were no protests for 100k ethnically cleansed Armenians a month ago."
This war has been ongoing for decades.
I'm sure they are. And they are dicks who are irrelevant.
"Yes, because sins of the father, and all of that, right?  What a pathetic justification."
And who funded Hamas?
"Thank you bin Laden. You’re using the exact same justification that bin Laden used to justify the 9/11 attacks - that America elected its government therefore the sins of the government can be taken out on innocent civilians. 

Dude, that is a monstrous position that ignores basic humanity. This logic is that anyone can attack any person living in a democracy because they elected their government. That’s a horrific belief to have. 

It also justifies the October 7th attack. Israel has an elected government, Hamas says that the Israelis are oppressing their people so they can attack citizens in retaliation. Israel just elections more recently that Gaza did. 

Monstrous."
"I’m sure you were. 

Further, I didn’t say you *were* an uninformed douche.

I say perpetuating the hollow point you made makes you *look* like an uninformed douche.

Pretty important distinction."
"Yes in a world of billions some people were cheering. That’s not what he was implying. Israel was given overwhelming support from basically the entire world right up until they started to do war crimes. 

What’s gaslighting is to take peoples valid support for Palestine and reframe it as “celebrating  before Israel responded.” That is not what happened."

"Where did you get that information?

Even just in children killed alone, Israel has killed many times over and is not done yet?"
Their land. Happy?
"It's a multidimensional problem-set, that's for sure."
Are they arab Israeli immigrants or descendants of Palestinians who fled after 5 arab states failed to destroy Israel for them?
"I wonder if you would comment the same if hours after 9/11 people went out to support Afghanistan because they knew US response would be disproportional. They went out to protest because to them it was a celebration of “Palestinian resistance” as many of these protestors said so themselves. What’s a proportional response to burned babies, raped women and entire families massacred as well as over 100 hostages taken? Please lecture me how another country would proportionally respond to a terrorist organization executing such an attack and have it exist on its border."

How's that dancing around the point when I directly pointed out how this is the standard EVERYONE should be held to?

">Trying to delegitimize activists who want (a) a ceasefire or (b) emancipation of the Palestinian nation


There was no demand for a ceasefire on Oct 7 — Israel hadn't even responded yet. And emancipation of a Palestinian nation? That's not what was going on Oct 7. They weren't chanting ""chop off their heads"" because they wanted a ceasefire or a nation

No I called out the trucks bullcrap just I will call out using this situation to increase attacks on the Jewish community.

"So your entire family dies because they existed in Palestine and you just want them to stop attacking their Neighbours who caused it? 

How many people will be that peaceful ? So 10,000 civilians died . Even if you have 5% of those related to the dead go toward hatred instead of peace - you have 500 new members of Hamas 2.0"

"Any comment on Arafat walking out from [Camp David in 2000](https://archive.is/IotS2)?

> Throughout this horrible week, my mind has repeatedly flashed back to Dec. 23, 2000. That was the day the Palestinians were offered a path to having their own nation on roughly 95 percent of the land in the West Bank and 100 percent of the land in the Gaza Strip. Under that outline, Israel would also swap some of its own land to compensate the Palestinians in exchange for maintaining 80 percent of its settler presence in the West Bank.
>
> The Palestinians would control, in President Bill Clinton’s formulation, “Arab areas” of East Jerusalem. And on the most sensitive religious sites, there would have been divided sovereignty or jurisdiction, with Palestinians controlling the Haram al-Sharif (including the Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques) and Israel controlling the Western Wall and the holy space of which it is a part. There would also be a return of many refugees into the new Palestinian state (without the right of return to Israel itself)."

I notice you have to add that disclaimer ""virtually"". As far as I'm aware they have marked aspirations to expand their territory.  And have done so several times in recent history, in fact.

I'm aware that some people in Israel have no aspirations for the country to expand its territory, but I'm not certain that their current president agrees with the idea.

>It’s well beyond the pale to morally equate an Islamic Caliphate 

Also, perhaps we have differing understandings of the old Testament's doctrine.

They encourage American Jewish settlers to go in, stealing the homes of existing Palestinians, literally kick them out of their houses and steal their land. Both Hamas and the Israeli government are full of evil actions. AND Netanyahu is the one who has FUNDED and propped up Hamas for decades. It’s exactly why people have been protesting the government in Israel and newspapers there are calling for his to resign. His plan was to empower Hamas so they Palestinian people and their dream of a free state of Palestine would die.

“Those who want to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state should support the strengthening of Hamas and the transfer of money to Hamas,” Netanyahu stated at a Likud party meeting in March 2019. “This is part of our strategy, to differentiate between the Palestinians in Gaza and the Palestinians in Judea and Samaria.”"

Is Hamas gone yet? If Hamas wasn't shooting fleeing people, forcing them back north, not allowing them to shelter in tunnels I guarantee there wouldn't have been as many children dead. Unfortunately Hamas hates Israel more than they care for their own civilians — hence why they use civilian infrastructure as military bases. Israel can either not strike them, which means they can act with impunity. Or they do strike and Hamas gets propaganda because people actually believe Israel is just gunning for civilians"
Jews always existed there even under arab occupation. Not everyone there came after world war 2. Palestinians will have to learn to share or their world will continue to get smaller.
Left after Israel kicked them out of their homes. Israel was built on land stolen from Palestinians
"If they’re the former, then they never had Israeli citizenship"
"None of the 9/11 attackers were Afghans, and the Taliban offered to hand over Bin Laden so I don't get the comparison.

Some of the things you mentioned haven't been proven but even so Israelis have also been doing all that; killing unarmed civilians, raping Palestinian women, massacred families, imprisoned over 1000 without charge currently, and in the West Bank have evicted families, destroyed homes, built illegal settlements, stole water, created sonic booms etc. What's a proportional response to 75 years ethnic cleansing, apartheid and mass human rights violations?"

"You are fundamentally misunderstanding the meaning behind the 'nazis at the table' saying. It represents being critical of people/groups who make *formal* deals/alliances with nazis. It harkens back to the rise of the Third Reich, where the NSDAP had to enter formal coalitions with other conservative groups to get closer to power. 

Here's the thing about gatherings in public spaces that you may not be aware: you usually cannot ban other people from existing nearby. 

It's intellectually dishonest, or to be frank *dumb*, to try smearing a longstanding political movement because of a few psychos. 

By your logic, supporters of Israel are also nazis, as there are documented cases of them relishing in violence committed against civilians."
"Yes, they’ve been offered a 2 state solution 5 times, with more land than they currently have and have rejected it every time. Do the Jews have a right to a homeland?"
"I'm not sure I agree with this. America (and its allies) invaded huge countries halfway around the world for the sake of being the world police. 

Gaza is a strip of land the size of Detroit, right next to Israel. Israel could occupy it indefinitely (or until re-education takes place like after WWII) if it means permanently eliminating an existential threat. 

It's not sending people into an unfamiliar foreign land, it's sending people to the next city over - a city they're intimately familiar with."
"Only 500? Hamas the terrorist organization has had full control of the education system in Gaza for the last 16 years. They literally put on plays with 6 year olds cos-playing as Hamas fighters attacking Israeli bomb shelters as a school play. 

We honestly have a better chance of deprogramming trump supporters then trying to reason with any of these people.

My response to these people is the same as my response to trump supporters. They are a lost cause. Let them believe whatever the fuck they want as long as it doesn’t involve me."

"A cease fire existed on October 6, 2023.

Everyone has the right to defend themselves against terrorist groups but that doesn't give you carte-blanche to drop bombs on families in the name of anti-terrorism.

You still have not addressed any arguments put forth by the reports concluding that there is apartheid. I infer that you are not interested in having a rational discussion in the matter but rather you are interested in shielding a government from criticism.

"Well you are only spouting terrorist apologia of ""what about the children"", and I already addressed it and exposed it. 

The children are the responsibility of the parents who created the environment they live in today by voting for Hamas the terror org which wants to genocide Israel and the Jews. It is not my problem.  Welcome to the real world. You make the bed. You lay in it. 

&#x200B;

You did not bother answering:

Right now there are 100s of 1000s of arabs all over protesting. But tell me how many arabs in the west were protesting against Hamas to free Palestinians? ZERO.

That shows Palestinians and the arabs in the west had no problems with Hamas at all.   
  
How many protests were held by arabs against the 20 million women in an open prison in Iran when they were fighting for their liberty?? ZERO.  
  
But now that suddenly Hamas and Palestinian attacks and attempts to genocide Israel and the Jews are facing the consequences for their actions, all terrorists and their sympathizers want to claim that Hamas is not Palestine. You think people are idiots??  
  
Your selective outrage does not fool anyone.

&#x200B;

You trying to downplay 20 million people held in an open prison in Iran as ""unintelligent"" does not mean anything. It only shows the kind of people who,have been let into the west - hateful, misogynistic, antisemitic, violent, and a serious threat to national security.

Sorry your terrorist apologia does not work anymore."
"That offer was not anywhere close to equal and allowed Israel to keep a lot of the places they had  illegally occupied. The USA is the opposite of neutral when it comes to Israel, the accords would have given Israel what they wanted at Palestines expense. It would have allowed them to maintain military checkpoints in the West Bank and retain large settlements there meaning the Palestinians would never be free of the IDF. They would have had  multiple enclaves and settlements inside Palestinian territory. The Israelis would control access to the Dead Sea and be able to cut Palestine off whoever they decided there was an “emergency”. Israel would have kept 9%  of the West Bank but only in exchange for other valuable land. Palestinian airspace would be solely controlled by Israel as would all the highways in and out of Gaza and the West Bank. All that is just part of the issue with the accords. 

Of course Palestine refused the offers, the would have made some things better but others would have stayed the same. It was not anywhere close to a good or fair offer."
"FWIW, the word “genocide” [has its origins in the Holocaust](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/what-is-genocide). Here’s what genocide actually looks like (NSFL): https://twitter.com/Judeoespanol/status/984304689448734720

"Why are dozens of Muslim ethnostates okay, but the only Jewish ethnostates is wrong?"
"Not that they do, but can you imagine if Jews took to the streets when Palestinians were killed? Would you say that the entire ""protest"" is legitimate if there was a Muslim there?"
Weird genocide that has seen the Palestinian population grow 10x since Israel's founding. The Israelis must be really bad at genocide or you don't know what that word means.
"According to [Equaldex](https://www.equaldex.com), a website that monitors LGBTQ rights in different countries, Palestine — with a score of 7/100 — ranks amongst the worst countries in the world. Palestine makes the top 10 list for the worst and most dangerous places to live for people in the LGBTQ community. The other worst-ranked countries are all Middle Eastern ones surrounding Israel. Tel Aviv has a giant gay parade each year and is seen as one of the gay capitals of the world. LGBTQ rights are widely accepted by the majority of the Israeli population."
"I really have to wonder why you’re attempting to conflate the clear, indisputable worldwide territorial ambitions of a global Islamic Caliphate with the minute, practically nonexistent territorial ambitions of a tiny Jewish state in the Middle East. The difference in scale of territorial ambitions is regional (Israel) vs *global* (Islamic Caliphate) and that’s assuming the very worst about Israel.

You have to be joking if you think Israel — a liberal western democracy — is in even remotely comparable to a regressive Islamic Caliphate based on literal Shariah law and Muslim supremacy.

And whilst I post IDF related ones, that doesn't mean I condone the shit hamas does to Israeli citizens.

The point is the actions of the IDF as mandated by the Israeli government and the illegal settlements (as confirmed by the UN and ICJ) are flash points.

But if people are just going to go off on their month old outrage just from Oct 7 with no knowledge of the area then all we will have is this. Circular arguments that go no where."
Because Israel is in that area (river to sea) that they are claiming.
"The Arabic translation of the chant “From the River to the Sea” is [“From water to water, Palestine will be **Arab**”](https://old.reddit.com/r/2ndYomKippurWar/comments/17dfaof/_/).

They’re chanting for Israel to be replaced by an Arab Muslim ethnostate."
"I have not heard of any massive movement calling for the genocide of Palestine.

But I hear arabs who came as refugees to the west now calling for genocide of Israel and shouting ""river to the sea"".

I also learnt that Palestinian refugees living in Kuwait supported Saddam Hussein when he invaded Kuwait, and then Kuwait deported them all, and Palestinian refugees tried to overthrow the king of Jordan and the king then kicked them out.

If they do this to their hosts, I can't imagine what it is to live next to them."
"Didnt they lose all that area when they attacked Israel?

Welcome to the real world."
They're a very not smart Destiny fan
"Dude in your other comment you revealed that you are antisemitic genocider using dog whistles. Your bad faith argumentation and these tricks is not going to work with me.

Thank you for the wake up call."
"The whole history of the world is filled with violence. From the smallest tribe to the largest empires. Islam spread by the sword across the entire middle east.

Israel was violently kicked out and reclaimed it. There are a ton of arabs in Israel today living as equal citizens.

Muslim violently captured Afghanistan, a buddhist nation and genocided the Buddhists there.

There used to be tons of Hindu in Pakistan and Bangladesh, where Muslims attacked them all and reduced their numbers to insignificance.

In Pakistan, to this day, Christian and Hindu girls and kidnapped and married off to old Muslim men and converted to Islam. 

There are 20 million Muslim women living in an open prison in Iran where they are attacked.

But you never see arabs and Muslims protesting against any of that. They only come out for selective outrage."
"Israel has always been there too.

That entire area belonged to the British which won it in war, which was how ownership was decided for 10s of 1000s of years. 

The entire world, every nation, every tribe, every region is a product of war and conquests. 

Britain then create Jordan and let arabs live there, and created Israel and let Jews live there.

Muslims in Pakistan genocided tons of Hindus and kicked them out. Even today young Christian and Hindu girls are kidnapped by Muslims and married off to old Muslim men and forcibly converted to Islam.

There are 20 million Muslim women held in an open prison in Iran who are attacked daily.

You never see any outcry from arabs Muslim in the west. Such selective outrage to defend terrorism by Hamas and Palestinians does not fool anyone."

"Yeah and look how much attention that got despite killing and displacing an order of magnitude more people


If people cared about the actual human cost those protests would have eclipsed the current protests"
I've stopped giving the benefit of the doubt unless they show a degree of care for at least one other group (non-domestic as well). No one is asking to care about every single conflict in depth but there are just as equally bad and worse atrocities going on than the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and if they can't even give attention to one other one then it's very obvious as to why Israel-Palestine is focused on.
"Yup! I have a history degree and have worked in the field, my opinion is valid as are the opinions of non historian Palestinians who have never known a life of no war."
"Sure, I don't think I disagreed with that, but how are kids responsible for that?"
It’s on the Israeli society to throw out their fascist murderous racist political leaders.
Yeah and the people who were horrified overwhelmingly outnumbered people who were not.
"You are in fact suppose to use the most powerful military in the region, backed by the most powerful military in history,  with the backing of the worlds best special forces, and the best intelligence network on the planet, with an unlimited budget, to access that tunnel system at any of the hundreds of other locations and entrances.

Baring that, you could focus on military targets and not bomb ambulances or assassinate journalists. 

You could also not target water treatment centers, bakeries, and the very safe zones you designated.

You know, war crimes?

You could also allow agencies like the UN and res cross to distribute food and water.

Sorry bro, we arnt buying it anymore.

Isreal has gone from a respected state to a word synonymous with war crimes in the vast majority of the world's eyes.

Good luck with that."

https://youtu.be/GRfUI3-mr24?feature=shared

They literally cheer for ""the resistance"" coming in on hanggliders to kill ""hipsters"" at a rave.

You would have gotten along great with the cops who demanded Daniel Hamm open up his bruise to prove he had been beaten in jail:

""Daniel Hamm, one of the boys involved in the riots but not responsible for the murder; he was nineteen at the time of the recording. At the beginning of the piece, he says, ""I had to, like, open the bruise up, and let some of the bruise blood come out to show them"" 

I guess you didn't see the image in the article of the Palestinian woman making the throat slit gesture or the man holding up a swastika. Take a look at the justification being offered for the attacks closer to you in Canada:

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/israel-hamas-palestinian-rallies-1.6990890"
"And I will reiterate


""If 9 people are sitting at the table with a Nazi, there are 10 Nazis at the table""



If they weren't okay with people celebrating the attacks they shouldn't have gone to the march — kicked them out of the march — or actively demonstrated against them. As it was they were happy to match along with vehement racists because they were on ""their side"" 



You can call it dancing around the point all you want but if you joined the march you are okay with what the extreme elements of that match are doing — unless you actively stop them"
">You are fundamentally misunderstanding the meaning behind the 'nazis at the table' saying.


No I'm not, people are just pissed that their own rhetoric is now applicable to them. The right wingers deserved to be called out for it and so do these people


>Here's the thing about gatherings in public spaces that you may not be aware: you usually cannot ban other people from existing nearby. 


Which didn't prevent anyone from calling out the right wingers for Nazis and fascists walking among them


>It's intellectually dishonest, or to be frank dumb, to try smearing a longstanding political movement because of a few psychos


It's frankly dumb to think having two different standards is acceptable


>By your logic, supporters of Israel are also nazis, as there are documented cases of them relishing in violence committed against civilians


No it's not — Israel is a country you have no choice if you're born into. A protest is a local event you elect you go to 


How could you possibly think those are similar?"
Yes I believe in a two state solution. So do you it seems and so does fatah. Hamas and Netanyhu are extremists and terrorists who do not believe in a two state solution at all

If anything the Israeli war crimes will fuel the next generation and drive recruitment up.

Yeah just like the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq stopped the Islamic extremists. Surely any minute now.

The Health Ministry said that 10,022 people have been killed in Gaza, including over 4,100 children and 2,600 women. More than 2,300 people are missing and believed to be buried under the rubble of destroyed buildings, the ministry said."

Now you are asking if it's LEGITIMATE.

You are grasping at straws.

You miss the simple point that the presence of Jews and multiple protests even in places like Israel and Germany point simply to the actions that resulted in Oct 7 AND what's going on right now.

There is no celebration. Why do you think Jews are out saying ""no in my name"". Or are you one of those who would describe racism to someone who has spent their whole life subjected to it?

"Caliphate is the only word I know that expresses the idea of a global religious theocratic state declaring itself the prime authority and representative of religion.  

In Islam, that concept is called a Caliphate.  In Judaism, it's not so much a concept as a national policy of a country that exists.

The comment I was responding to was sarcastically highlighting the fact that Israel lobbies for itself that way, which is why I mentioned it.

The point of my comment wasn't even to criticize Israel's policy of attempting to create a Jewish Caliphate, that was just a concession I was making while pointing out that we need to address antisemitism.  

You're welcome to compare and criticize the two religions if you like, but I'm not interested in having that discussion with you."

"This whole framing is putting it in a way to infantilize the Palestinian people. It's about them as a whole needing to do it, no matter what their age was or whatever else you bring up. Because if Hamas can't be eliminated internally they will be eliminated externally and that will be the death of tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians.

That's the issue I take when people try to push off blame or infantilize the Palestinians, there is no getting out of what has to be done It doesn't matter how unfair it is or how young they were or any of that crap, there's a terrorist organization That is also the government of Gaza that's attacking their much better armed neighbors, and either the Palestinian people decide that Hamas does not represent them and removes them, or  they will be blown up as collateral damage when Hamas uses them as meat shields and antagonizes until they get the martyrdom they want."
Not what you said though is it. And I am thinking there are large parts of the world where that is absolutely not true.

Your argument leaves no room for a peaceful and prosperous solution. I hope your not right for the sake of the innocent people."
Well Someday if Fatah actually speaks for the majority of Palestine I will be able to take this conversation a little more seriously. Because right now I just see people attacking Israel and then being flabbergasted that they would dare to defend themselves.

"I support a 2 state situation as I recognize that it is the only option that would allow peace but I firmly believe that Palestine and it’s people need to be free of Israeli control and the IDF. 

You cannot honestly believe that sectioning off two unconnected pieces of land, surrounding them by Israeli territory on almost every side including the sky and sea, keeping Israeli checkpoints throughout the West Bank and allowing the Israeli government the ability to close down all access in and out of parts of Palestine whenever they feel it’s prudent as anything but oppressive."

It's on video.... you can easily find them. 

Videos and photos of people in the protests holding their phones up with the nazi flag or Hitler on it. One muslim lady was caught at a NYC protest doing the Heil salute to the jews across the street.

Just because a few jews (they say they're jewish) attend a few protests doesn't mean that most jews are against Israel or it makes the protests on Oct 8th-9th (celebrations) any less disgusting.

thats it.

"A few paragraphs from the piece:

Many Canadians, concerned about the upsurge in antisemitism, say they are baffled about why Deborah Lyons has so far not taken to social media to offer the Jewish community public support.  
  
The appointment of Ms. Lyons, former ambassador to Israel and to Afghanistan, as Canada’s Special Envoy on Preserving Holocaust Remembrance and Combatting Antisemitism, was made just over a week after the Oct. 7 attacks.

Toronto Police say between Oct. 7 and Oct. 25, there were 15 reported antisemitic hate crimes compared to seven in 2022 during this time period, and three in 2021.  


Ms. Lyons told The Globe and Mail on Sunday that she plans to make a statement early this week, and has just finished the first leg of a “trip across Canada meeting with the communities, hearing from them on their fears and concerns and working on solutions on how we move forward.”  
  
Amira Elghawaby, Canada’s Special Representative on Combatting Islamophobia, has been vocal on X (Twitter), condemning abuse of both Muslims and Jews in Canada during the war between Israel and Hamas."
"Where is Trudeau calling these pro Palestinian protestors ""a fringe minority with unacceptable views""? Oh, right, there's two millions Muslims in Canada. Can't lose out on those votes"
"
What's the salary for this position? I too would like to be paid for contributing nothing."
Liberals have been playing division politics for decades
"Pssst.... To effectively combat anti-Semitism and ensure the safety of the Jewish community, it is a good idea to start enforcing our existing laws & prohibit the display of Hamas flags on Canadian streets. Allowing such acts to continue without challenge, or a peep from our politicians and local MP's where these events occur, continue to undermine the security and safety of Jews. Hamas is a recognized terrorist organization that calls for the complete destruction of Jews. How clearer can it get?"

They can’t be serious with this bullshit. Then when another Muslim gets killed by a psycho here they’ll do some mealy mouthed ‘we don’t tolerate hate in Canada’ and wonder why they’re getting screamed out of mosques and churches"
"Why does it have to be attacks on Jews. Is it not attacks on Israeli??  Israel has many religions and some non religious.  We need to change the narrative and keep it focused on Israel and not Jews in general.  I find it always seems to go that way. Israel wants everyone to think attacks are against Jews, oh the world is hating on Jews we are being oppressed again. Fuck that.  It’s NOT. Most if not all the hate and comments are against Israeli and not Jewish people.    And I get sick of hearing otherwise in the news cycle."
"I keep getting told to not conflate Jews with Zionism, and then in the next breath they tell me how ALL Palestinians are Hamas and terrorists deserving of death.

This is going to result in in the growth of actual Antisemitism. It’s nudging me in that direction"

Israel is the problem. Every Jew should have a problem with Israel. It's not antisemitic to stand for human rights. Hate crimes on Muslims are on the rise. Also reddit is teaching there are shortages of racist bigots in Canada. Israel is killing in the name of Jews.

"Criticism of Israel is not antisemitism. Watch, I'll do it: I don't like Netanyahu and can't wait for him to be voted out.

"This is why it's so important not to throw around words like nazi and genocide at every chance. 

It minimizes the past, and minimizes what actual nazis are, blending them in with the cosplayers."
"Of course it is. It's deeply progressive on racial issues, and progressivism became deeply racist in the past 20 years.

The political left in this country used to adopt a middle ground between liberalism and socialism. And its approach to racial issues was firmly rooted in the principles of liberalism: treating people as individuals. Liberalism has always taught that racism is wrong because treating people as members of a group based on some inherent and immutable characteristics is immoral.

However academia started adopting a different model to race in the 1970s, recasting race through a marxist and postmodernist lens and viewing racial conflict as a critical power struggle. That viewpoint metastasized into broader society in the 2000s.

But the problem is this isn't the first time that argument was made. In fact, this is literally the *core principle of fascism*. The political left allowed racial nationalists to set their agenda on race politics and the rational nationalists did what rational nationalists always do: they turned to fascism. This is why when you go to university campuses and talk to the students about race today, if you were to translate them into German they'd sound like they were plucked out of the streets of Berlin in 1932. They're recapitulating exactly the same arguments that the fascists of Germany and Italy made in the late 1920s and early 1930s because they're approaching race politics from the same ideological position.

The left's transition from liberal anti-racism to fascist anti-racism is a huge part of the reason why race relations in the US have decayed so badly over the past twenty years.

Edit: Autocorrect apparently turned racial into rational. lol."
Not to mention bringing in an actual Nazi into the House.
">This is the most divisive government this country has ever seen.

"It is one thing to protest air strikes killing children, but it is another to blame the Israelis instead of Hamas. They should be demanding Hamas surrender so the air strikes stop and the civilians are saved. The last thing they should have as a sign is the Hamas flag. They should be having their leaders give speeches on a two state solution with specific borders and Hamas being a non element in that world. Then they can talk how the Palestinian people have suffered and this can be viewed as a cornered animal lashing out without options, but at the same time condemn their methods and aspire to the civilized international order way of dealing with these issues."

Point of order.  What you are describing (with broad society starting to pick up these fringe academic concepts) occurred in 2013.  There were glimmers of it in 2011 during occupy wallstreet (many in that movement point out the oppression olympics being a big reason why occupy died).

I agree with everything else you said, and it's important to understand what you have described."
Very well said. It terrifies me where this all might head. The pendulum has swung way too far for this not to cause immeasurable damage to western society.
The rhetoric that students in universities spout about socialism and communism has nothing to do with racial issues. It's about capitalism failing the majority of people. Race relations have degraded for the same reason gender relations are degrading. People are too busy being offended to talk to eachother. And when you find people talking to eachother. No body is listening they are just spouting information at eachother and ignoring what the other person has to say.
"Ah yes, the old vague ""we're too quick to label racism"" yarn from people who also can't stop complaining about race issues. As if racism isn't a problem, labeling it is.

"Who was waving nazi flags really?

Wasn't it just a single photo?

He didn't make a comment about the Taliban, ISIS or Hamas flags being flown in Canada either.

He didn't make a comment about the rallys calling for decolonization efforts in Canada similar to that Hamas in Israel.

Yet he made a comment about a single photo at the trucker rally out of 10,000+ people there.

The Nazi flag was a Liberal plant. Their identity has never been revealed, nobody on the left tried to find out who he was? I feel like he would have been found by now. A single photo too? It's on the side of a building inconspicuous, not in a crowd of people.

It is a Liberal Plant, and I can't believe it worked, and the Liberal Party is absolutely filthy and disgusting for what they did.

Millions of photos of other things, thousands of videos, and just one random photo of Trudeau Flag and a Nazi Flag, and the entire country starts calling the rally full of Nazis.

It is disgusting what they did, I cannot say that enough. I don't even support the anti-vax crowd, I got a vaccine, three times!

Liberal playbook to try and make the other side look like bigots, they are so unbelievably filthy in their tactics, I can't believe that single photo from the trucker rally is on the tip of everyones tongues when you mention the convoy.

"Israel is the powerhouse in the region and responsible for massacring nearly 8,000 civilians in Gaza. Hamas isn’t an excuse for them to do this and Israel must stop."
">Criticism of the actions of the State of Israel is not anti-semitism.

Justifying attacks against Jewish Canadians and their places of worship is anti-semitism."
"While that part is true what about all the people celebrating the day of the attack on Israel? What about the protests that targeted a Jewish owned coffee shop? What about all the student unions on the side of Hamas and refusing to criticize them? What about the people pulling down the posters of missing Jewish people? What about about the morons holding Hamas flags and chanting ""from the ocean to the sea""? 

This is far more then just criticizing Israel, this is targeting Jewish people and supporting a terroist organization inside Canada."
"Say it with me people ...

Calling for a Global Jihad and flying ISIS & Hamas flags at anti-Israel rallies across Canada is not mere criticism of a state. Tearing down posters of the civilians that the terrorist organization Hamas kidnapped from their homes  is not mere criticism of a state. Intimidating Canadian diners at Jewish owned restaurants across Canada is not mere criticism of a state.

It is clear anti-semitism and the anti-semites will bend themselves into knots trying to steer the conversation away from these documented events ... spiteful, hate-filled bigots that ~~you~~ they are.

"So much propaganda in one post. Let me dissect this and I encourage you to look into these claims. A quick wiki search will do its very easy to verify fact

Firstly, the Jewish population of palestine are largely immigrants. Prior to the first wave of immigration in the mid 1800s, the Jewish population was 5% and they spoke Arabic. They were Palestinian Jews called Yahud Abna Arab. By 1890 waves of immigration resulted in the number increasing to 10%.

By 1920 when the British took over, the Jewish immigrants openly stated they wanted to become a minority on a land that was already inhabited. This is unjustifiable and unacceptable to any people. Who would agree to being colonized? Yet the British aided the Jewish population in doing so despite the existing populations disapproval. 

They resisted and protested and attacked the settlers to the best of their abilities, but they were protected by the British. By 1939, Britain had disarmed the Arab population entirely and armed the Jewish population.  Note that this is all before the holocaust. 

In 1947 Jews made up 33% of the population and owned less than 10% of the land. Yet they tried convincing the British to make them their own state. The Arabs living on those lands did not like this, why should they give up their land to people that arrived 20 years ago? The arab proposal was a unitary democratic state, something the Jews didn’t like because they would be a majority (and why should they be?). What happened next?

The Jewish population attacked the Palestinians and expelled them in a campaign of ethnic clenasing that created modern Israel. Once over 300,000 people were expelled, the neighbouring countries intervened. They intervened **in response** to ethnic cleansing and failed to do anything about it. 

By the end of it 700,000 people were kicked out of their homes. After the war they tried to return but were locked out and shot at when they tried. That is the issue. If Israel gave them their land back, there would be no conflict. However Israel wanted to play with demographics and thus resulted in this current situation.

In fact, israel maintains its current apartheid conditions precisely to avoid giving equal rights to the Palestinians it occupies. By drawing out bantustans that it controls militarily, the air space, the water, the borders, what goes in and out, the politics, the infrastructure, and all other aspects of life, it can claim that these bantustans are independent and not give them voting rights all while depriving them of the other aspects of living in an independent state. If israel gave the people it occupies citizenship, they would only be 50% Jewish, and that’s not even considering the Palestinians in diaspora. The right to return is central and would end the conflict overnight. Thus to this day, israel maintains the dispossession of the people that lived there for thousands of years to “keep the nation pure”."
"If Israel commits any verified war crimes I will condemn them. There is no apartheid.

So I will ask again.

Do.

You.

I mean, you even try to claim that someone *can't* label recent antisemitism because they labeled earlier antisemitism.

Make it make sense. Do you deny that invoking the holocaust over a needle and wearing the Jewish badge is antisemitic? Do you not recognize the swastika as antisemitic?"

"Look at this!  More whataboutism.  There is no disputing that Hamas is responsible for it’s shit. No one walks away from war without blood on their hands and they are accountable for their war.  But that doesn’t absolve Israel, or create a balance. In the culmination over the decades since the 40’s Israel is the larger aggressor. They even have gone on record saying they *plan* on pushing out Palestinians.  Netanyahu has even bragged about how he funds Hamas to undermine Palestine.  And that quote isn’t even from some dark part of the web. That’s from the Times of Israel."
"Who is holding the other side in an open-air prison? Who has laws in place to discourage interracial and interreligious marriage?  Who has legislation in place that says only one group are considered citizens? Who has been gradually pushing the other side out for decades? It’s not the Palestinians.

It’s become a pretty common thing for people to try to convince others to hate on Palestine because “they are anti women and anti LGBTQ.”
So far, pretty much everyone I have talked to who has pulled this line seems to be anti-trans if we dig deeper.

And as if the West is a perfect haven for marginalized groups.  There’s legislation in North America now that prevents women from getting abortions, preventing teachers from explaining LGBTQ issues,books being banned, etc. Not to mention the Christian Nationalism movement trying to combine church and state again in the US.  

I am not so naive to think that Palestinians don’t hold problematic views, but that does not justify the deaths occurring. 3000 dead children will now never grow up. Can’t teach dead kids about feminism, racism, and LGBTQ+ issues."

That's not a dignified, well-intentioned, response. If Palestinian Authorities accept that deal, they have to accept that their land was forcibly stolen from them, and it belongs to Israel.  

That's not right. Israel needs to give back EVERY inch of Palestinian land they stole since 1917.

And it ceased to exist after it, along with the Arab league, tried to commit /actual/ genocide against Israel, only for Israel to grow its borders, and for Egypt and Jordan to annex most of it.


The country of Palestine only became a thing again after the 6 day war when the peace accords called for Jordan and Egypt to withdraw from their occupied territories.

It’s been Israel that’s initiated peace talks over and over. And in 2008, they were willing to meet all of Fatah’s demands. Full withdrawal from the West Bank, part of Jerusalem turned over to Palestinians, free transit between Gaza and the West Bank… but still, no. Abbas dithered and Hamas attacked, and the sides haven’t been back at the table since.

Let’s keep our focus on the precise situation and not devolve into whataboutism. It’s a weak tactic. It is the Zionists who have been actually not that secretive about wanting to push Palestinians out.  It is the Israeli government that determines a lot for what happens to those citizens. Egypt does not have control over the utilities of the area.  And Egypt is not the colonizing force. Egypt did not create Gaza as it is today in the first place.

"The Israeli government definitely guilty on many accounts, but framing them as solely responsible for a conflict that is extremely complicated and historically older than you and I, is disingenuous and only leads to hate against Jews and not the government of Israel, it’s the type of rhetoric that revives a sick mentality.

The only reason I asked about Egypt is because they have a closed border since 2007 that effectively creates this “open air prison” you are blaming solely on Israel. Egypt could open the border if they wanted to, and end this prison, why haven’t they ? Again this whole thing is extremely complex and not as simple as Israel the bad guy like too many people on here want to say. It’s ok to criticize them for the bad things they do, will do and have done, but saying falsehoods or omitting key details as to make them look worse then they are is not a good way to go about it.

I genuinely don’t understand why people are so keen taking sides? Stand with both of the civilian populations, and do your part to prevent real world anti semitic actions that are actually taking place across the world and even in our own country. Your words matter, and your opinion although it won’t have an impact on the conflict, can impact people who aren’t part of it."
"So according to that, and the Haaretz article, the way Bibi(a bastard who should rot in prison, imo) has supported Hamas is:

1) work permits for Gazans.

2) not blocking foreign nationals from entering Gaza.

3) turning a blind eye to Hamas attacks that don’t cause appreciable damage.

4) allowing construction materials like cement into Gaza.


Which of these do you think he should have stopped?

Should he deny Palestinians work permits in Israel where they can make more money?

Should he risk diplomatic incidents blocking Qatari officials from Gaza?

Should he have attacked Gaza to remove Hamas sooner?

Should he have blocked vital building supplies?


Which would you have accepted?"
Thank you for seeking to learn
"
Again, you are discounting this as something that merely happened in the past.  You are overlooking the attitudes of the original and present Zionists.  This is an ongoing apartheid we are taking about.  

If you want to argue this more, you need to learn about it."
"The situation is indeed complex, but that line prevents people from even thinking about it.  It is a complex task, but not impossible.  If you look at it objectively you will see that there is one side that has been the most powerful, killed the most, and has enacted the oppressive policies. 

The first time I heard about this situation was 20 years ago from an Israeli woman I met who sought out a medical exemption from the IDF because she did not agree with what her government was doing.  She is not the only Jew who has taken a side.  And it’s not against Jews. It’s against Zionism, particularly the far right Zionism of the Israeli government.

Yes, Egypt could open it’s borders, but again, who is creating the problem?  Who is driving oriole to radicalization? I suggest you learn more about Zionism, about the British Mandate, about the Nakba, about how ethnic genocide and colonialism works.  

Not taking sides is important when you are first learning about a situation. But if you refuse to educate yourself further, you have no standing to criticize those of us who are putting the work in and have come to our conclusion."
"He specifically supported Hamas to undermine Palestine. None of those things are wrong, to be sure. But we should not be so naive to assume any of these agreements were done with the Palestinian’s well being"

"But do you see what a ridiculous no win this is?

The argument is that he’s supporting Hamas by not being MORE aggressive towards them. 

Like again, I hate the guy, but to me, this is just evidence of why the current war needs to be seen through. There’s literally no peace that can be had as long as Hamas stands. Either you have to be the villain and block things like cement, or a way for people to make decent wages, which just draws more condemnation and further turns Gaza against you, or you open things up more and Hamas uses that to attack you more.


When this war is done, I want to see Bibi in jail. I want to see Israel out of the West Bank, and I want to see just fucking boatloads of aid and nation building happening in Gaza. But you can’t help Gazans as long as Hamas is there… you just can’t. They steal aid, they turn water pipes into missiles, they exploit any income Gazans make through taxes, and it all gets reinvested into their sick twisted Jihad, or into the lifestyle of their leaders in Qatar.

There are some groups that can only be dealt with through violence, and Hamas is one of those."
"Because the fact that Israelis were ousted from
Somewhere else does not justify them oppressing other people. It’s irrelevant. 

The British brought in Jews and gave them passports without input from Palestine. And the original founders of Israel had the intent of ousting the Palestinians."
"Oh I am not saying Hamas needs to stay. What I am saying is Israel enabling this situation in underhanded ways.

One reason Hamas is so powerful is that no one else has been voted in for 16 years.  Because there has been no election for 16 years.  Israel could help change the situation by seeking a political solution and encourage a new election.  But with the state it is in now, that is not likely.

One huge solution, however, is to call a cease fire and significantly work on improving the lives of Palestinians and ceasing colonial takeover.  Hamas is made up of highly traumatized adults who were highly traumatized (and often orphaned) children. They get support from a highly traumatized population that is very desperate and has virtually no one else to provide resistance. Take away the desperation of the populace, start treating them better, and much support for Hamas dies. Trying to bomb Hamas out will only add to the death toll, but it won’t kill off Hamas.  It will just make more traumatized children grow up into traumatized adults who are vulnerable to radicalization.

Edit: But, if your goal is to finally get rid of all the Arabs then keeping them desperate is perfect. Then they really can be written off as “wild animals” or “dogs” as Israel calls them and it is easier to kill them off.

Also, Bibi is not the only bad character in the Israeli government"

What political actions could Israel take to pressure Hamas to hold another election?"
"Have you ever heard of a logical fallacy?  

Those issues in other countries are a separate situation but we are talking about apartheid in Palestine. 

Yea there were Jewish people living in Palestine.  Palestinian Jews. They still exist. The issue is that the Zionists came in and began ousting Palestinians and had their own mandate from the beginning of expelling Palestinians.  

The Palestinians were justified in not wanting to be overtaken. And the Zionists did not simply want to *live* in Palestine, but to take all the land completely.

"Well, and that is the tricky part.  I do not know how exactly how Israel with it’s current mindset, especially that of the government, could pull that off as an honest actor. Even going back a year.  

Ultimately, even if an election were to be held, the issue of oppression still exists. 

So the more effective solution would be to invest in the well being of the citizens affected. Starting with a cease fire agreement. Followed by investment into social programs in the area to bring the unemployment rate down and the standard of living up. Next I think some sort of judicial procedures or reconciliation commission. 

Those are a few thoughts , but we are at the limit of my knowledge.  What I do know is the IRA did not dissolve from violence, and neither will Hamas.


Edit: oh, it will also take a change in Israeli mentality so the law against educating about the Nakba or colonialism in often countries needs to be lifted. As well as the law law discouraging people of different backgrounds of faiths to marry.  Israel would also need to change their constitution so that people who are no Jews also can have self determination (aka rights). The IDF might need to change it’s strategy from one of conscription of almost all recently graduated young adults to specialized training…."

How do they get the Hamas government to agree to allow an election?

The idea of Israeli warplanes flying over Gaza, dropping crates of food directly to the people before Hamas could intercept it did just pop into my head though… and that’s a much nicer thought then what’s current happening."
"Britain was not a neutral party.  Britain was a colonizing force. And the Palestinians were barely consulted and then the final decisions were made without their input.  

Imagine you own a place with some roommates.  The mayor comes in and dumps in a bunch of people and says you have to live with them. You protest, but the mayor says you live in his village so technically he can do this. He even signs these new people on the deed of the house without your knowledge. 

The new people have a belief that this is their special home because their great great great great grandma lived there. Now they wish you were not there so there would be more room for them. You know this because *they say it to you.* Tension grows because more new people come in. The Mayor tries to step in and slow immigration so the newcomers blow up his shed. 

The mayor attempts to divide the house but you do not like the terms. Why do these newcomers get the majority of the house when you and your roommates outnumber these newcomers?

Eventually the Mayor steps away and is like, “you’re on your own”.  Right away, the newcomers kill off a bunch of your roommates, and kick more out of their rooms. They even take over the kitchen you remodelled yourself.  You now live in the back rooms.

You fight back, but they are stronger and they get most of the neighbours to back them, even lying to the neighbours. They keep bullying you. Some of your roommates have had enough and start attacking back. Your neighbours are not helping, you have nowhere to go, at least your crazy roommates are doing something. 

The new people make new laws in your house saying only people like them are “real” roommates. They take over the utilities, they sometimes just come in and turn off your lights. You meet someone from the newcomers whom you fall in love with, but you are not allowed to share a room after you marry. You all live in the basement or in the far west wing.  The newcomers keep coming in the west wing to take rooms from your roommates.

The fighting continues. Your crazy roommates get more intense. Many of the old ones have been killed and now the fighters are the kids of roommates that have been killed. The newcomers taunt you saying they will kill all of you off. But the neighbours don’t see this or hear this. When the newcomers attack you the neighbours shrug and say it was self defence. When your roommates attack they call you all terrorists.

Some agreements to stop fighting are made. But they get broken either by the newcomers or your roommates. The significant majority of these breaks in peace are by the newcomers, but all your neighbours think that you are the transgressor every time.

The newcomers are even calling you “dogs” now. They call for the elimination of all of you and your roommates. They make no secret of what they plan on doing. Many neighbours start to call for a cease fire, except for the mayor and his really rich friends, who have been giving money to the newcomers.  They push you out of one half of the basement.  They tell you the other half is safe.  It is not.  Some neighbours come in with cameras to see what is happening. They get shot by the newcomers.  The west wing gets bombed- your crazy roommates don’t even live there! It is apparent what is happening.

And yet because you said you wanted them all pushed out after all of this, you are the bad guy.  

False equivalence"
"As much as it does have *some* roll in this conflict, it’s not actually that much about Jews vs. Muslims.  There are Palestinian Jews and Christians. It is easy to think of Palestine as simple radicalized by faith when the radicalization really comes from desperation. 

The intricacies of putting on an election would be tricky. Although, if the Israeli government were replaced magically by more centrist or left wing politicians (who yes would be Jews) it might be possible to work with Hamas in better faith.  

But like I said, the solution is probably going to have to start with meeting the needs of the people and building them up. When people are not scared or being bullied, it’s harder to want to fight.  It might not get rid of Hamas entirely, but it would weaken them significantly."
[deleted]
"How does Israel build up the people of Gaza without dealing with Hamas, though?

That’s the rub. You give Hamas aid for Gazans… how much gets to them?"
"You’re either severely overlooking the Zionist mentality that fuels the idea of Israel or severely underestimating it.  

The issue is not that Jews want to live in Palestine.  It’s that the Zionists- the ones in charge- want to make Palestine solely a Jewish state.  It is colonialism. It is genocide.

https://ccrjustice.org/sites/default/files/attach/2016/10/Background%20on%20the%20term%20genocide%20in%20Israel%20Palestine%20Context.pdf"
"You start with a cease fire. We are getting to the limit of my knowledge, although there are much smarter people than me who study solutions like this as a profession who should be consulted.  

But again, bombing the shit out of Gaza does not get rid of Hamas and doesn’t get aid to them either. I think 3000 dead children is enough. Or do you think we should kill more children as opposed to making the silly mistake of having our aid intercepted by Hamas?"
[deleted]
"I think every time there’s a cease fire, Hamas breaks it and more people die. The more this gets kicked down the road, the more people die.

Hamas needs to be removed before any serious attempt at rebuilding Gaza can be made."
"And here we have another logical fallacy: whataboutism.  This isn’t a Jewish vs Muslim situation. It is Zionists vs. Palestinians. And ousting of people from an area is absolutely not ok. But it does not justify Israel’s colonialism. 

Honestly you could try harder."
"Out of all ceasefire violations, 191 were by Israel. 95 were from Palestine. 

Oh I was wrong, the child death toll in Gaza is now at 3257."
[deleted]
You do not get to say that displacement of one group justifies the displacement of another.  That is not how it works.
[deleted]
"Hahaha. Balances outcomes? You are serious?  We’re not taking about trading Pokémon cards. This is real life.  

It’s just… wow.  Over 3200 kids killed and here you are talking about exchanging people tit for tat like it’s some sort of game. 

There is no balance in propagating violence you silly little muffin."
[deleted]
"That does not make any of it ok. But that type of colonialism can definitely be blames for the state of this situation.

Both sides?  3200 kids are the Palestinian number.  The number of dead Israeli children is 29.

Your optics on this situation are so narrow, only focused on one real point, and it’s laughably weak."
[deleted]
Hamas started *this* part of the conflict. Israel’s response is overkill.  Israel is using this action to kill all the “dogs” as they call it.  Hamas sucks but to give Israel a free pass on any of this is simplistic and lazy thinking.
[deleted]
"That is silly. Israel would then have to kill every Palestinian because what makes people most prone to radicalization is desperation. 

And this is what some Israeli officials and pundits are calling for.  Sounds an awful lot like genocide.  Sounds an awful lot like Nazism.  

The IRA did not disappear from bombing the shit out of the Irish. The apartheid did not end in South Africa from bombing the shit out of native Africans. 

You take desperation and oppression out of the equation and you significantly take away the power of Hamas within the Palestinian population.

Or… do the Nazi thing."
[deleted]
"It was their land?  Sounds an awful lot like you have not read much about this conflict before coming up with your opinion.  You have just kind of become a bore- I have been explaining and explaining and you just keep spouting off the same half-baked arguments. You can look it up yourself. You obviously have access to the internet and time on your hands. You seem capable of reading. 

But the thing is, based on our interaction, I don’t think you want to learn. Heaven forbid you might find out you are- *gasp*- wrong about something.  Oh my, wouldn’t *that* be embarrassing? Better just spout off uninformed opinions on the internet. Less cognitive dissonance that way."
[deleted]
"Lol so? Even MORE whataboutism!  The actions of the US do not justify the actions of Israel.  And no, you do need to learn more because you clearly do not understand how colonialism works.  The Palestinians were there first. You are advocating for their displacement. If you have done “a lot” of reading on this is has been clearly just from one perspective."
[deleted]
"Palestine does not mean non-Jewish.  There are Palestinian Jews.

Imagine American Christians claiming they can move into Britain and kicking out the Brits because there are Christians there.

So it is indeed colonialism.  Maybe if all of you *extensive* reading included learning about colonialism you might know that."
[deleted]
"This is actually ironic that you are citing indigenous concerns, as some of the very same colonial tactics used against FNMI groups have been used against Palestinians. Keep in mind I have not said Jews do not deserve to live in Palestine. I am saying they don’t deserve to treat Palestinians the way that they are. 

I actually sympathize with Israel wanting it’s own state and safe space after all the shit Jews have been through. But ethnic cleansing is not the way.  There’s plenty of Jews and FNMI people who agree with me."
[deleted]
"Well, I am not an expert in this area but trying to learn. While the situations are not exactly the same and are at different stages, we could get some ideas from the recommendations from the TRC.

It would definitely have to begin with a cease fire agreement, with tangible penalties from the world stage for breaking the cease fire. Followed by significant cooperative aid and social programs to bring Palestinians out of desperation.  Programs to bring the unemployment rate up from 40%. There would have to be significant changes in the political psyche so education will be prominent, including on the Israeli side. Laws preventing the discussion of the Nakba would need to be abolished and curriculum would need to incorporate reconciliation education.

Far-right Zionism would need to be replaced with more moderate ideology.  Obviously on the Hamas side as well, but as the stronger entity, Israel may need to take the lead on this.

Those accused of war crimes on both sides may need to face judicial proceedings on the world stage.

The constitution will need to be changed to allow everyone the right to self-determination, not just for Jews. Laws that prevent Jews and Palestinians from marrying will need to be overturned. The two state solution might need to be re-examined. 

The IDF will need to change it’s recruitment from conscripting young adults right out of high school to specially trained professionals who get regular education and training. Eventually, incentives to collaborate with Hamas in peace keeping endeavours put in place. 

Religion would need to be removed from state, or the state will need to be informed by a multi-theistic board also representing a balance between Palestinians and Israelis.

Finally, HUGE amounts invested in mental health services for everyone."
[deleted]
"But that requires the cooperation of Egypt to open it’s borders, which it is not obligated to do, which means the only direction that road can go is genocide.  Exploring peace deals in different variations is always possible, albeit difficult.  Because otherwise, genocide.  And let’s not forget the lack of Hamas in the West Bank has not prevented Israel from bombing them either."
[deleted]
"Wow you really don’t want to drop the genocide thing. You’re like the Oprah of war crimes.

“YOU get a dead baby, and YOU get a dead baby, and YOU get a dead baby…”"
[deleted]
Genocide has been happening this whole time.  And refugees going over the border to escape being killed does not make it less genocidal if what they are escaping is genocide.
[deleted]
"Oh, come on. Have you not heard how Israelis are talking about Palestine?"
[deleted]
"Oh sweetie, you have a very narrow idea of what genocide is.  And here you were lecturing me about FNMI issues, hahaha.

I mean, sure anyone can sympathize with the desire to smash the opponent, but that doesn’t make it a reasonable or intelligent action.  

Believe what you want to believe, you’re still wrong."
[deleted]
"Oh?  So you think genocide didn’t happen to Indigenous groups because they are not all dead? Hahaha.
It’s not as simple as just smash smashy stab boom. It’s more systemic than that.

Maybe you should read a bit more:

https://ccrjustice.org/sites/default/files/attach/2016/10/Background%20on%20the%20term%20genocide%20in%20Israel%20Palestine%20Context.pdf


Of course I condemn Hamas, but your tit-for-tat veneer is disingenuous.  Do you condemn Israel for years of systemically oppressing and pushing out Palestinians? 

You are so sympathetic to Israel being driven to the brink and being desperate enough to want to get rid of all of Gaza, yet you cannot find the same empathy for a group of people that have been driven to harsher desperation due to how they have been marginalized and treated for decades.  

You notice I have pointed out Israel’s atrocities but not once did I say “and therefore bomb them all” and yet here you are, bloodthirsty for Palestinian children’s  deaths.  

We all have our biases, but I really try to keep mine in check and learn both sides of this situation. Your lazy ass can’t get past just the hulk smash stage of processing catastrophe.

Develop some maturity, buddy ol’ pal. None of your arguments have been novel or nuanced.  I’m actually getting bored. I’m frankly surprised it took you this long to request a condemnation out of me. It’s becoming an old schtick."
[deleted]
"This is just going around in circles.  I have already told you. You have representatives from Israel saying similar things for what it’s done, and again you are just focusing on Hamas. You are not discussing this in good faith. You are not asking for information in order to learn. You have already made up your mind that the only option is ethnic cleansing. So there is no point arguing with you. 

You have fingers. You have access to the internet. You don’t have much for critical thinking skills, but you can work on that. If you want to know more information outside your own echo chamber look it up yourself. 


Except you don’t really want a well-rounded view on this situation.There’s nothing interesting you are bringing up that hasn’t been parroted about over and over. 

I’m bored with you."
[deleted]
"Already explained it, you dismissed it and just want to kill. Go read or like find a hobby or something."
[deleted]
"Hahahah, oh this is adorable.

Again, you are just picking and choosing any kind of flotsam  and jetsam that seems vaguely convincing, but you have not put together a strong case. Your stance from the beginning is that Palestinians just need to die/ go away, which is… wow.  But on top of that your evidence for such is weakly defended. 

First, you justify it because well other nations have done killing (ignoring their individual geopolitical situations and wether or not it was.

You continuously insist on ignoring any investigation into the Palestinian perspective or on how colonialism works.

You completely refuse to see how this could be in any part colonialism. You even try to bring in a FNMI comparison as a sympathetic example to Israel. You naively didn’t realize that if you were to look further you would realize that the colonialism that affected FNMI people is the same kind that Britain and Israel used/ are using on the Palestinians. (This was particularly precious).

You seem to refuse to learn how colonialism works.

You refuse to learn how genocide works, despite me sharing you information on genocide very specific to this conflicts.

You try to say the colonialism in Palestine is justified because hey, Arab countries kicked Jews out so this is just a fair trade. In fact you cling to this rather hard for some time until you realize it doesn’t work.

You insist on pointing out what Hamas leaders have said while refusing to acknowledge that Israeli leaders have said the same thing. It’s like you assume Israel is just saying things (but doesn’t really mean it) while assuming differently than Hamas. This ignores the details of how both parties have been acting with strong bias to Israel (such as the myth that Hamas is always breaking cease fire while in reality Israel far exceeds in this area).

And then you disingenuously ask for solutions. At times you say you want all families safe, at others you say the only solution is elimination, which implies killing (unless Egypt blah blah blah.)

So lots of switching around the goal posts.

And now you cheekily misrepresent my with this:

“So I did some digging based on your position that torturing, raping and murdering civilians in Israel is no different than bombing Palestinian civilians to death because they happen to be near military targets.”

Which is not what I have said at all. That is misrepresenting your opponent and gaslighting.

So far we have had a lot of logical fallacies and simply bad debate skills going on.  I’m no pro, but you debate like you have mincemeat for thought patterns.

I’m not interested in playing anymore. You’re. Just another thumb on the internet."
Let them figure it out.  The fuck is Canada supposed to do.
"*""Leave us out of it, we have enough problems.""*

Yup."
"I’m ok with this. To be fair though I’m not really sure if either the Israelis or the Palestinians want our input. As far as I can see they are pretty ‘meh’ about what our government thinks. 

And I’m sure in the new year, the rent-a-protester crowd will have something else to be up in arms about anyway and will lose interest."
Why stick your dick into a hornets nest?
Canada has nothing to offer anyway. The US has stated they support Israel no matter what. Anything anyone else in NATO has to say is irrelevant.
Canada should absolutely stay out of this.
"I would support a peace process but I think for it to be viable we'd need to see more support from the surrounding Arab nations than we've seen so far. 

Any solution has to involve Iran and Egypt in my opinion."
I don’t think we can afford to be involved in it.
Makes sense seeing it has nothing to do with us.
Canada has been fairly neutral so far.
"I for one stand with the Ukraine...

&#x200B;

Oh shit, I'm late aren't I?"
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts. The give a fuck level is bottoming out. We can't save the world.
"*Someone starts talking about Israel...*

Only safe response: ""I have no stake in this."""
"Besides providing humanity aids, there is no place for Canada in this conflicts."
"We got more important shit to worry about like our own countries problems. I don't care about two religious factions fighting each other, I just want a better QoL in the country I reside in. Human history is literally wars over ideals, values, race, religion, and it's not going to chance because some idiots hold up traffic on the road or piss off people just trying to live their life. And before the obvious ""Protests arent suppose to be convenient"" yea and you have a lower chance of someone getting aggressive with you if you don't go out of your way to piss them off in the first place. Leave people the fuck alone, we don't give a shit."
"Let em figure it out. 

This also means no financial support to Israel either."
Hamas is terrorist organization and netanyahu’s government is also genocidal in nature. That explains a lot
"The most neutral position I believe we can take is ""Fuck Hamas, Fuck Netanyahu"""
It is always the vocal minority who drag us into politics we don't want to involve.
"Pretty much. This is why we (especially the media) shouldn't give any attention to the protestors. Pro-Palestine, Pro-Israel, far left movements, far right movements etc. A flame dies with no oxygen. Let's just focus on Canadian problems. Interprovincial trade barriers, special interest group overreach/corruption in politics, housing & mortgage rates, opioid/homeless issues, propping up lesser developed First Nations groups, healthier food, stronger economy etc. 

This doesn't mean let's not help outside of Canada either. I'm absolutory for giving foreign aid to countries not at war, and helping out less fortunate areas, but let's just not get involved with external politics. We can still collectively condemn clear ""bad guys"" that threaten global stability like Putin/Kim Jong Un, but Israel & Palestine is way too complicated for Canada to be involved."
"I have a theory that if If I put ""Free Palestine"" in a comment, the bots will home in on it."
"I suspect most Canadians see Hamas and the state of Israel as guilty of atrocities, are repelled by both, and side with the civilians, Jewish and Muslim, who are suffering. We want an end to the violence, justice for all the victims, and we want our government to help find a way to a reasonable (for all) peace."
"I have way more sympathies toward Ukraine than this Israel Palestine conflicts.

For Israel and Palestine, both sides are scummy.

I also want to stay neutral for Israel Palestine, but I want to go all in for Ukraine.

🖕 🇷🇺  💩"
"Our opinion means nothing as long as we have no troops on the ground.

I think food and medical aid is fine, but military aid shouldn't be sent to anyone."
"For 2000 years both parties have fought each other while both maintaining they are Indigenous to Palestine. 

Let them sort it out, or, book a plane ticket to lend a hand"
"Canada is not taken seriously by their allies. Wasn’t that long ago that Canada’s allies drafted a joint statement without even consulting Trudeaus government.

I’m absolutely tired of seeing the pro hamas rallies disturb our lives here. At the same time keep doing it assholes, the world is getting fed up. 

Argentina made their choice, the Netherlands are making their choice soon enough if PVV gets a coalition. So progressives hijacked liberalism and the far right is slowly advancing. See how that works out? 

Keep waving them terrorists flags and preaching hate speech. Go for it Jihad Z, the tide will eventually sweep you under."
"Canada has no way to tell Israel or Palestine what to do what's so ever we have nothing that we can hold over their heads to stop the conflict, so why should canada get involved what so ever"
We need to stay out of it.
I also dont want millions more refugees
Isn't Trudeau planning on bringing in over 10000+ palestinians. Not really staying neutral at that point.
[removed]
Don’t forget that Hamas kidnapped Canadians aswell we cannot afford to be neutral while they are still being held by terrorists
Neutral would lead to supporting Isreal...for all their faults they at least are operating within some kind of legal framework...
"I feel for the Palestinian people, but Canada is a country that’s an ocean and a desert away with our own issues. Stay the hell out of foreign affairs and focus on home"
"Ideally we would have a government somewhat reflective of majority opinion of being neutral.

Of course we don't have that. We have both the major parties consistently voting against 95%+ of world opinion when it comes to Israel. 

https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/why-canada-votes-with-the-minority-on-un-resolutions-on-israel-1.6650027


Basically joining micro island nations in failing to denounce settlers."
"Canada sold weapons to Saudi Arabia and yet nobody gave a fuck about the war in Yemen or all the dead people. 

People are getting propagandized to hard to rabble rouse in Canada for a ""Free Palestine"" in order to split the leftist vote and allow pro-Putin fascists to take charge. It's totally inorganic."
Majority of Canadians tired of defending the indefensible and now retreating behind impassivity.
"I'll admit a soft pro-Israel bias.

Israel buys our guns and planes; they're a modern economy that is integrated with ours, same as a nation like South Korea or Mexico.

Hamas is more like Al Qaida or ISIS, murderous terrorists who would happily murder us if they got the chance.

I've never been worried that an Israeli terrorist is going to go on a stabbing rampage in my city, or do a suicide bombing, or ram a truck into a crowd. Can't say the same about the people they're fighting.

Support Israel?

Support Palestine? 

I'm from Canada. I support my family when they need me. I support my community. I support the Leafs."
"There is no ""neutral"" position when a terrorist organization commits unspeakable atrocities against innocent civilians."
"We have antisemitism enthusiasts  and useful idiots protesting on the streets with antisemitic slogans  however those as our PM is saying are 'fringe minority'.

Literally all  Canadians I know or neutral or support Israel. People I know are from age group from 30 to 70 year old. I assume those 9% that support Palestine have to be younger."
Then they will have to deal with Hamas and radical islam on Canadian soil.
"I stand with Israel, but I don't have a problem with Canada shutting up. Everything that comes out of Trudeau and Chow's mouth is an embarrassment."
"Ok. Be neutral. Stop sending any money to Israel and disallow Israeli products in Canada. Be TRULY neutral.

Problem is you can't do this. In the internationally connected world we live in you can't just look away and say ""lalalala I don't wanna look"". 

This is exactly the same as not wanting to acknowledge what the Nazi's were doing in the Warsaw ghetto. It's not an out of pocket comparison. It is completely valid.

People don't want neutrality. They want people to stop forcing them to acknowledge the atrocity thar Israel is performing.

Genocidal fascist states cannot be supported."
"After reading the comments, it seems people think neutral means ""trade with Israel and vote with them on every UN clause, while ignoring Palestine as a state and voting against them in every UN clause."""
I doubt the has ever been a protest march in Gaza or tel Aviv demanding their government do something about Canadian indigenous matters.  They don't care about Canada. Why should Canada care back?
Neutrality in the face of genocide?  Grotesque.
"All I want is for our government to not directly be supporting genocide or terror. 

Humanitarian aid to massacred children would be OK imo. 

Nothing wrong with building good will in the world for us, especially when so many people hate the USA."
"The government is not taking a neutral stance. They actively vote for Israel in the United Nations even when it’s only 7 countries in the world voting for Israel, Canada and US are the ONLY western countries. Shame on Canada for not being neutral. Can’t even get that right."
Good to hear I'm in the majority.
What's that quote about good people doing nothing in the face of evil?
The fųck we do.
Gee I wonder why? Maybe it's because if you say anything positive about Palestine lots of people call you a terrorist apologist. Say anything positive about Israel you're a genocide apologist. 🤷‍♂️
I still have no idea why this is even an issue in Canada.
What is one of the most geopolitically irrelevant country going to do to one of the oldest ongoing conflicts in human history? Shame them to death?
"I prefer neutral. I have sympathies with the Israelis, but this isn't my conflict and I want our government to avoid disputes that have nothing to do with us."
"Everyone saying Canada is neutral is willfully ignorant. [Canada’s Scotiabank holds the largest foreign share of Elbit Systems, whose wares have been connected to rights abuses.](https://theintercept.com/2023/04/06/israel-arms-scotiabank-elbit-david-fingold/)"
"I think we need to stop sending aid to Palestine, drying up foreign aid would make even Hamas want peace."
"israel = ally

hamas = terrorist

i do not see any logic in not supporting israel with the destruction of hamas.  otherwise it just goes on like it has been for decades.  negotiating with terrorists for hostages is a huge mistake and that would be the only reason why i would say canada should be neutral - it is a total gaffe to do this."
"Honestly I wish our military was 10x it's current power state and we could arrive in force, right in the middle and say ""CUT THE SHIT""

And then, along with an actual functioning UN, take care of the hamas problem as a police operation as it should be.

None of this fantasy is realistic unfortunately"
"We're literally having like 4 crisis in our home country. I want neutrality because we need to be solving the housing, COL, wage suppression, and government corruption (ontario provincial for sure) crisis here on our home soil before we can even think about helping foreign nations.

To all the people actively protesting for the conflict what do you expect us to do when we just instituted immigrant abuse as our primary immigration policy. What do you expect us to do when anyone we bring in as a refugee definitely cannot afford to eat or live. What do you expect us to do for these foreign nations when our problems are only getting worse because our various levels of government are clearly not making any effort to fix problems that they can profit personally off of.

No matter your view on the conflict we need to fix these issues before we can be of actual value to the people in these regions suffering. Anything else is virtue signaling."
So Hamas isn't a terrorist organization?
"Picking sides in the oldest conflict of all time from the safety and comfort of your home in Canada, wave your flags with a belly full of Popeyes that you got doordashed right before you get bored and watch the new marvel/Star Wars on Disney+. 

You’re doing nothing for anyone but you’re desperate to participate."
"No surprise there, the vocal minority who have delusions of grandeur do not speak for the rest of us."
I hate terrorism and want to be firm against it.
Fakenews!
yet canadians have to take side on the ukraine war
"Fair, but that ignores decades upon decades geopolitical history."
I want WW3
"I am just tired, groceries is up and I can never afford a house.

Don't care about israel, palestine, ukraine, russia, china, taiwan, india or khalistan."
"Yup, Nothing I can do or say or tell our politicians will do that will have any meaningful or lasting impact in a region I don't understand. It's a UN/US, Israel/Gaza/West Bank, and the countries in that specific region's problem. Has been for decades"
Correct.
... duh
Outsiders should be involved in conflicts like that
"Israel doesn't need our help militarily, and Hamas is a proxy for Iran.  What western nation would ever support them?"
"Leave us out of a religious war, Israel vs Palestine. Neither one is good, they both want to kill each other."
"Sounds about right. We just want our government to focus on making life more affordable here and keeping the economy from cratering in a deep recession. Most of us don't give a shit about yet another war between Israel & Palestine that's not going to solve anything. 

Let the US deal with this mess."
yup
I agree
"Canada has enough problems within its own borders. We've already taken a stance on the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and extremist settler violence against the Palestinian people. We don't need to get involved in it. Our own citizens are struggling to eat and house themselves, we don't need to send our underfunded and under equipped CAF in to anything, we need to address the problems at home. We can't do anything to stop the killing over there, so focus on where we can actually make a difference."
"Israelis and Palestinians have hated each other for a long, long time. Israelis have more tech, more money and more first world support. It's inevitable what is going to happen."
"Ah yes, the old Canadian “Not my circus, not my monkeys” mindset. It’s this kind of fence sitting that has gotten us to a crisis in almost every aspect of our lives."
This is the way.
Our only role is to keep it contained in Isreal. Let Isreal take care of Isreal and Canada can take care of Canada
"I mean, it's a long walk to get involved directly. Plus I'm sure there would be a lot of setup/paperwork, probably best I just sit this one out."
Why is this even a concern for Canada? We have so many problems at home we should be focusing on. You don't make a sandwich for the hungry neighbors if your own family is hungry.
"There’s so many conflicts around the world. Some we should be involved in some capacity, and others none. 

The only role we should have with the Israel-Palestine conflict is one of diplomacy. Let them decide what kind of future they want, a unified state or separate states. It’s not our job to decide for them."
"We can send our arm forces to invade both Israel and Palestine and add them to the great Canada area..

First step... must first activate our shock and awe geese force"
[removed]
How come people don't say 'what the fuck' anymore?
Not give political cover to Israel in the UN
"The politicians would just have to announce a cease-fire and all of this would stop, amirite guys? /s"
"I don't think that we're afraid to get involved, just look at Ukraine. Majority of Canadians just know better than to get involved in the most complicated, messy, morally ambiguous, blame from both sides going back decades and centuries and both sides kind of have a point, conflicts in the world."
"We are not outof it though.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadian-special-forces-members-on-the-ground-in-israel-dnd-confirms-1.7012157"
I think people want us neutral to avoid all of the protests and hate crimes that are springing up in Canada.  Taking any side at all on this enflames either Arabs or Jews in Canada.
"Sure! If they don't want our input though, seems fair to assume they don't want our funding either."
They *definitely* want your input. They both want material and political support. They both want the UN to pass resolutions that favour them. For this they need to propagandize.
"The Israeli refugee plan has Canada listed as one of the place that they can send hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees to, so sees it as a tool to be used to displace the population they’re trying to get rid of."
"The reason I’m not ok with this is the fact the only way forward for a two state solution seems to be an international intern government in Gaza.  

When Israel is done with Hamas someone will have to govern Gaza and an international coalition seems like a far more legitimate outcome than a government installed by Israel.  

I think Canada could play a role in supporting that government although I think you’d also need support from the surrounding Arab countries and Gaza residents to really make it work"
"Neutral, however, would mean stopping financial support to Israel that is being used to fund the war.  Humanitarian aid for civilians is neutral in terms of taking sides in a conflict.  Arms dealing is not.  And we export millions in weapons every year to Israel.  That would have to stop.  How likely is that, do you think?"
"Thinking Canada has weight on the international scene is the equivalent of the ""but what does ja rule think??"" meme"
Palestinians want and need everyone's support and attention... they certainly have my favor. It's hamas that's the problem
"There is a position we can, and should take. The position is to condemn any loss of civilian life, and to support a peaceful transition to a 2 state solution as soon as possible.

  
What we should not be doing is providing Israel weapons, nor any support. Naturally we shouldn't support Hamas, but I don't think that was ever happening or going to happen anyway lmao.

&#x200B;

However we shouldn't be silent as a possible genocide/ethnic cleansing takes place. We shouldn't have been during the Holocaust, during Rwanda, nor now."
">To be fair though I’m not really sure if either the Israelis or the Palestinians want our input

Canada had sent about $21 million worth of arms to Israel last year and I'm sure Israel wouldn't want that to drop off."
The amount of Israeli propaganda and a concerted effort to call everything anti-semitic suggests otherwise.
You were dropped as a child?
"I say this as a proud Canadian; who the fuck are we, to them? I don’t understand why they would care at all about our opinion/stance"
"> I’m ok with this..

I am too.  This isn't my battle and I think they're all assholes."
WE NEED GAY PANDA UNIONS NOW 🐼🌈💪
"True, the only thing that could actually stop this war is signed letter from Hollywood celebrities."
Being neutral means we stop selling weapons to Israel immediately and do nothing outside of calling for peace and sanity.
It has nothing to do with us. Are we going to have an opinion over every single small conflict that erupts in the middle east?
hypothetically if hamas was about to overrun israel and create a 2nd holocaust do you think canada should do something then.
[deleted]
The Arab neighbours have unfortunately made it clear that they won't take in the Palestinians. They use them as political pawns.
"good luck with that, surrounding Arab nations hate the Palestinians

an Iran wants Israel dead"
How is Iran a relevant party to this? They aren’t even Arabs. They just need to stop meddling in Arab affairs.
Why does any solution need to involve Egypt and Iran?
No it hasn't. We've only said Israel has a right to defend itself and has a right to exist without saying the exact same thing for Palestinians. Why does only one side get to exist? That's implicitly saying it's cool to murder the other side and they should take it.
But not the Canadians(?)  protesting on our streets.
"Why? Hamas is a terrorist group intent on eradicating the  Jewish people, full stop. 
This is not about a land grab as so many people fail to understand. There hasn't been a Jew in Gaza since 2005. The daily barrage of rockets started in 2006, coincidentally the year Hamas came to power"
"It could be better. We need to outlaw selling arms to Israel, and to make donations to Israeli organisations non-tax-deductible. Then we could truly say that Canada is ""neutral"".

Which would be a terrible thing, mind you, but at least lawnmower dads would be happy."
How much military funds got sent to Israel again?
"There just aren't very many Rohingya, Uyghur, etc. refugees in Canada, not nearly as many as refugees from recent wars in the middle east. Those diasporas just aren't here to push their foreign agendas.

Interventions from the West under pretext of stopping war crimes or atrocities committed on the other side of the world were never *truly* motivated by those things. The protests we see today demanding... whatever it is they're supposed to be demanding are no exception."
"""So how about that Isreal Palestine conflict""

""OMG WHAT'S THAT OVER THERE!""

🏃💨"
You want to tell that to all 'Free Palestine' protestors out on our streets.
"I'm not sure how giving people aids helps, but it's better than getting involved in the middle east."
"But they are:

https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadian-special-forces-members-on-the-ground-in-israel-dnd-confirms-1.7012157"
I think that it is absolutely a good thing that both Canada and Japan did not participate in this joint statement.
Most delusional comment of the day
[removed]
a legal framework they have been found to violate repeatedly.
"You're joking right? Israel is the one with all the power, all the military, all the money. They're literally the only country preventing peace and systematically oppressing and ethnically cleansing the land for decades. But they're the neutral option? Lmao"
"Why would the world opinion of some random despotic countries in Africa or the Middle East matter to Canada? Canada is aligned to its closest allies, most importantly the US and that’s all that matters."
Lot of people were mad about weapon sales to Saudis
ban all religions that don't support interfaith marriage.
You must live in a different Canada from the rest of us because that was a big deal and led to a lot of protests.
"The majority of Canadians have tolerated the intolerant, now the rest of us have to pay the price for it. Karl Popper’s ideas are playing out in real life."
"I have a joke for you. 😁

https://www.nestorfalls.com/the-official-canadian-temperature-conversion-chart/"
Correct. Free Palestine.
My bubble is 20-40 and not a single person supports what Israel is doing. I'm sure you'll just claim they are all anti-semitic though.
4.9% of Canadians are Muslim. 4.1% of Canadians are useful idiots like the Queers for Palestine crowd.
"Canada is an example of the “Paradox of Intolerance”, people have tolerated foreign extremist and now it’s time to pay the price."
This is a very warped vision of reality developed by basing your opinion on biased conservative media.
"Don't worry,  the same drivel coming out of Trudeau's mouth will be coming out of Poopivere's mouth if he wins."
Yes
The US says clap and we slap our palms together. What do you expect?
UN is a farce.
It's kind of hard to care about other cultures' or governmens' problems when your own are so glaring and omnipresent
Are we indiscriminately bombing children?
"If they had a large population of indigenous Canadian immigrants they probably would. Ukrainians protest here, Khalistan activists protest here, and basically every significant population of immigrants."
"It's a bit more complicated than that because Canada is already involved in the conflict, whereas Israel is not involved in indigenous matters here. By involved I mean that Canada exported over $21M in military goods to Israel in 2022, so we are arming the IDF and directly contributing to their ability to wage war on Palestine. Protests against that, or protests to try and get our government to pressure Israel, are in my opinion totally valid."
Both sides are genocidal and it is indeed grotesque. That’s why we should distance ourselves from both of them.
"Yep, humanitarian aid = good, military funding = bad. Not sure how it's controversial, yet most people in here would argue the inverse."
"Lol.

*""How can people say Canada is neutral?  A private Canadian company is one investor in a different private company!""*

We might as well put boots on the ground.  /s"
"Canada is part of a group of countries giving $600 million a year in aid to Palestine, with $50 million sent by Canada last month to Gaza. That doesn't mean we've sided with Hamas."
[removed]
Your fallacy is conflating Hamas and Palestine
Yeah as it stands now Hamas or Israel would kick the ass of an unsupported (read: US help) Canadian combat force.
Who said that
"You mad person, only time I would suggest sending out the geese force is after a nuclear attack."
"Yeah, that's the neutral/no-involvement position."
Definitely true
Ah ok so cut all humanitarian aid to Gaza
This is true. We need to cut humanitarian aid to Gaza immediately.
Trudeau just increased funding to Gaza. We don't fund Israel.
which side? because technically we be funding both.
Speak for yourself. I’m “what the fuck” to everything
Evolution.
Endless hate cycle. Only Israel and Palestine can fix it. I hope they figure out a way to do it.
"Forget even the history: if Ukraine was lobbing rockets at Russian civilians or doing anything similar to what happened on October 7th, we'd likely all be fine with the sidelines"
You can read the article and see that's about embassy security but keep spamming it.
I want us neutral because both sides have a reason to be super pissed at the other.
"Well also what business of it is ours? We're a religiously neutral country thousands of kms away, mind your own fire as it were"
What Jews? There’s like 300k in Canada total compared to the 2 million Muslims. Mostly all in Ontario and Quebec
"Right, all those Jews causing all that trouble in our streets. That's what people are afraid of. /s"
If that’s the way it works ok. How much funding does Canada send Israel out of interest?
Seeing pictures of dead Isreali and Palestinian children makes me favour neither of them.
"This is the truth, unfortunately. This is the way that the area, whoever does what atrocities, will garner sympathy and support and gain disdain for the other."
I’m sure they do but as Canada is not a member of the UN Security Council our vote counts for absolutely nothing at this point in time.
"which is why its sad that people dont care or want ""neutral"" just supporting palestine doesnt mean you support hamas just fucking stop supporting israel. and push back against their genocide."

It does? Who shared that with you?
Well they’ll need to get in line behind the big boys and girls who other countries listen to.
"I would like this but we haven't played Peacekeeper since 2000. Pakistan is a logical choice as they are a big UN contributor and Muslim so they may not be viewed as invaders. Nigeria, Philippines, South Africa and other regular UN contributors would be good.

The USA and much of NATO will have to stay out as they are not trusted by the locals. Also, the Ukraine war is still ongoing."
"Not sure, but we buy more arms than we export to Israel"
I’m not going to disagree with you but stop using genocide. You’re using it incorrectly.
What happens when Palenstine turns down the two state solution again? They keep turning it down and hamas has made it clear that they will keep turning it down until they've cleansed the land of Jewish people & at that point it would be a one state solution again because there are no more Jewish people to make up a second state....
Wiping out a terrorist organization isn't genocide.
"Compared to the $3.8b the US sent them, I don’t think they give a crap about $21m. 

They’d be more upset about losing the $131m they earned from selling arms to Canada."
"Israel has their own homegrown arms manufacturers, so $21 million from Canada amounts to nothing.
How much has our government given to the terrorist group known as Hamas, the governing body of Gaza? A whole lot more than $21 million"
That has probably got to be one of the lamest replies I’ve had on Reddit. Is it recess now?
Embarrassing response.
"You can have an opinion that killing civilians is bad, Israel isn’t going to be offended by people saying we don’t support the murder of non combatants."
Sure.
"This is the crux of the matter, the Iranian constitution calls for the elimination of the Zionist entity. I could be the kindest person in the world but you can’t convince me to lie down next to a rabid dog. You can’t negotiate with crazy theocrats. The Iranian theocracy is a poison that is destabilizing the world and some western leaders appease them."
🤷‍♂️
Yes why wont the neighbours help Israel with the ethnic cleansing? Such unkind countries!
"The opposite, they refuse to assist in convenient ethnic cleansing"
"If they take the Palestinians then Israel could swoop in and take Gaza. Anyway, the neighboring Arab countries (Jordan, Lebanon, etc) already have millions of Palestinian refugees. 

I would support Canada taking as many Gazan refugees as possible, no questions asked."
"Eh, not necessarily.

They just don't want to take in more refugees, which would be detrimental to their economies that combine into two cents."
Could have something to do with them bankrolling Hamas and Hezbollah
"Iran is one of the major suppliers of weapons to both Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon (Hezbollah).

It's a lot harder pushing for Hamas to push for a military solution when they aren't being paid or given the weapons to do it."
The millions of Shia is Iraq and Syria will have a different opinion. They often view Iran as their only protector.
Iran is the one manufacturing the weapons that Hamas uses. Egypt is the closest Arab nation in the region that’s capable of projecting leadership to the other Arab countries.
"The article is about Canada's foreign policy, not Canadians in general."
"There will always be a minority of people protesting on both sides. While these groups may be vocal, they don’t necessarily represent the views of most Canadians. Many have a personal stake in these issues and others are social or political activists. I would imagine that most Canadians are more concerned with the political issues we face in Canada over a war which Canadian politicians have very little sway over."
I would say most are neutral but the protesters make a  lot of noise which generates the headlines making it look like the average person has chosen a side.
Most Canadians aren’t out protesting. It’s just the fringers
what about the Canadians(?) supporting Zionists like yourself?
The land grabbing is happening in the West Bank.
"It’s laughable when Zionists sweep history under the rug. You are talking absolute bollocks!

Settler colonialism by its very definition necessitates violence and oppression. Israel is an illegal settler colonial project. Violence and oppression are so constant, that they seep into every facet of life for the colonized Palestinians. There are no periods of “calm” or “normalcy” for them.

Nothing you say about Hamas justifies Israel’s ethnic cleansing of an entire people."
And what about foreign aid contributions to Hamas and the PA?
"Canada is a democracy with the right to hold protests. If you don't want to participate, you don't have to."
"If they approached me, I very much would, but why would I go out of my way to stop them from protesting in general?"
"Damn those people exercising a right to peacefully protest, we need to stop that right now because I don't personally agree with them!"
Canada should only help people on individual level instead of meddling into others' conflict
That's to protect the embassy
"Not condemning Hamas is a good thing after the Oct 7 attacks, when Hamas is on Canadas terror list?

Sounds progressive enough, checks out.."
Yea you’re right I must’ve been delusional when I saw that polievre was leading Trudeau in the polls and delusional again when i noticed his lead increased since oct 7.
Sure but still a step above full on terrorism.
I’m not but I’m also not in the mood to argue over why a terrorist organization is absolutely impossible to negotiate with.
"Look at the break down of some of those votes. It's not some random despotic countries. Basically every European/South American and Asian country voting to denounce settlements. To actually be in favor of settlements is a ridiculously one sided position. 

Plenty of US allies seem to have a modicum of independence on these issues and vote more in line with ideals of international law (e.g., it's wrong from some New Yorker to fly over to the West Bank to occupy territory meant for a future Palestinian state). 

If our foreign policy is basically agreeing to whatever the US does then it's a pretty pathetic state of affairs our government has created."
"What fucking world are you living in? Whatever it is, you're skipping through it all on your own"
No it didn't. Nothing even remotely comparable to Palestine.
"We haven't just tolerated the intolerant. We have let them murder and pillage in all impunity with our full support. 

Free Palestine."
You know Hamas’ propaganda really worked when you see people they would throw off a roof without a second thought protesting in their favour. It really is quite remarkable.
please tell me those queers are campin ... pulling a few legs
[removed]
Is the price being paid soon? All I've seen so far are peaceful protests with the occasional act of illegal behaviour and prompt arrest. One of our hockey teams losing the playoffs results in much worse.
">Poopivere's

Are you 5?"
I don't think so. Pollievre has stood firmly with Israel and Jewish people since day one and even sent Melissa Lantsman to speak at the Rally for Israel (to much applause -- in contrast to Freeland and Chow who were both booed).
"I expect people to hold a different stance, not the government.

Disappointing that we echo our governments cowardice."
"Lived on a border in turmoil. The UN brought peace to it. It is ineffectual at times, but can do some useful things if the US and whoever they're fighting agree together."
A farce that helped create this problem in 1948
I think they can be forgiven for not protesting about foreign victims of genocide when they are in the process of being genocided themselves.
ty for your sanity
lol ya I caught a few downvotes right after I posted this. Fucking war hawks man
"No, because Palestine isn't Hamas. We also sent *much more* to Israel military funds, which is very different than humanitarian aid."
your fallacy is misreading my comment.  i didnt go anywhere near what you are saying.
No not like that though /s
"I'm down for that, redirect it to food banks in Canada"
Hamas is funded by the Qataris.  Israel lets them smuggle in suitcases full of money past their own border guards.
The Genocide side.
"I want us neutral because a vast ( vast ) majority of Canadians really have no stake in the conflict, short of grandstanding for one side of the conflict or the other.   

Is it terrible? Heck yeah.  But this is also is a very small population of people being impacted, relatively speaking, yet the whole world feels they need to offer their (I’m just as guilty!) two cents and are picking a side and rabidly defending it when they didn’t care before 10/7.  We’re all being gas lit constantly by both sides to bring attention to the issue but really we don’t need to be involved at all.  It’s just adding more noise and confusion to someone else’s  already complex issue"
"When it's awful vs awful, awful wins."
"Agreed, the rise in anti-muslim sentiments in Canada since the Gaza bombing campaign started on Oct 8 is very disturbing."
"Yep, I will remind my fellow Canadians that 31 people under the age of 18 were killed by Hamas in Israel since Oct 7. That's more than the Sandy Hook shooting for comparison."
"Stop looking at snuff. 

Also, you don't have to pick a side between Israel and Hamas. Ideally both of these polities would be deposed."
"I mean, it's an accurate assessment. Not an invitation to be dismissive of the atrocities. 

Free Palestine."
Canada have been one of the few western country supporting the settlement in the west bank though. Just us and Poland.
It's not a genocide.
Agreed. It's a moral imperative.
Hamas is trrrorist organisation that committed genocide
Hamas COULD stop shooting at the IDF but noooooo Israel is the problem.
"Hey now, don’t be antisemitic. The Israeli government is going crazy now, it’s illegal in Israel to express solidarity with Palestinians, let alone say Palestinians are the target of a genocide"

">What happens when Palenstine turns down the two state solution again? 

May as well phrase this as ""What happens when Israel presents a plan with no right of return for Palestinians again?"" Both Israel and Hamas are guilty of using peace talks as international relations PR. Both Israel and Hamas are bad faith actors in the peace process and they want the talks to be extensive, then fail.

Any plan presented by Israel that doesn't allow displaced Palestinians to return to Palestine (while Israel lets *any Jewish person* become an Israeli citizen) is not a sincere attempt at reconciliation."
Hamas official position is the 67 borders.
"Do you think everyone in Gaza is part of Hamas, or do you have estimate of how many citizens/civilians are okay to kill for each terrorist?"
"The Israeli government literally funded Hamas as a strategy to keep Palestinians divided, it was official government policy, so they could take their land.

Where’s the outrage for that?"
"> How much has our government given to the terrorist group known as Hamas, the governing body of Gaza? A whole lot more than $21 million

News to me.  Source?."
Honest question
"I mean, both Israel and Hamas have been happily killing civilians for decades now."
">You can’t negotiate with crazy theocrats. The Iranian theocracy is a poison that is destabilizing the world and some western leaders appease them.

My fellow human thats exactly how that whole area sees Zionists.... Word. For. Word."
Rhetoric and actions are often very different. Actions are often a lot more pragmatic than the rhetoric.
You understand the blockade on the Egyptian border is as strong as the Israeli one right?
"They don't want Palestinians in their countries because every single one of them have been burned by accepting Palestinian refugees in the past. Read up on your fkin basic facts and history, you ignorant troll. Palestinians tried to overthrow the government/monarchy of every single country that accepted them like Egypt and Jordan, and were a major contributing factor to the civil wars in Lebanon and Syria. They helped the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait when seeking refuge there. Seriously learn some fkin history before you come spew your ignorance."
"When you're talking about ""ethnic cleansing"" are you talking about how Jews were forcibly removed by the IDF in exchange for peace with Palestinians in 2005 from Gaza? Or the 20% of Arab Israelis who are Arab that wouldn't be subject to any sort of removal?"
"Why wont they help support a two state solution that recognizes Israel as a state?

That's the real solution here, or just absorbing the Palestinian population into Israel entirely as full citizens."
"Fortunately, we won't."
"> I would support Canada taking as many Gazan refugees as possible, no questions asked.

Might want to look up how that worked out for Jordan in 1970.  And Lebanon from 1975 to 1990.

There's a reason why none of Israel's neighbors like Palestinians."
"sure

they hate hamas and are terrified of having them in their countries

they use Israel as a front so they can blame it all Israel

surrounding Arab countries give a pittance in aid compared to Europe and the west

the rest of the world is taking in refugees by the millions but Arab nations (sure Jordan has many Palestinians) do little in the way of monetary aid, peacekeeping and accepting refugees 

its pathetic"
In the past it also proved very detrimental to internal stability.
"Well that was the subtext of my post, the Iranians have no business in the Arab world and should be persuaded with force if necessary to stay out of Arab affairs."
"Qatar is the biggest donor to Hamas, and the Muslim brotherhood in general is who Hamas aligns with. 

Iran in itself isn't gonna prevent peace, it never did in Lebanon, when Hezbollah is much more loyal to them than anyone else.

There are hits here and there but it's generally safe. I lived in a border village, and I ised to visit a river where the fence was visible regularly."
"We all know it, the meddlesome mullahs from Iran have their hands full. They meddle in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen, Bahrain and others. As someone who lived in Dhahran during the Arab spring, I remember Iranian gunboats in the Persian gulf broadcasting radio signals asking the Saudi people to overthrow their government."
And the 'Free Palestine' protestors want our government to take action - not be neutral.
"That was my point.  The majority of Canadians and those who put Canadian interests first aren't out protesting.

My original comment:

>From the protests we're seeing on our streets I'd say the majority that want Canada to take an active role aren't Canadians, or see themselves as muslim/Arab first and Canadian second."
Do they though? I would not have heard anything about them if it wasn't for people complaining on Reddit. I would say the parents rights thingy made more noise.
"Do you people even read any history? 1917, 1947, 1967, 2000, 2005, the Israelis told their Arab neighbors they could have all that land, and every time, the Arabs said NO! 
So, go read a little, get up to date, and then bring a viable solution on what the State of Israel is supposed to do"
Pretty sure the 12 tribes of Israel might dispute your bs
"Always shocking to see how well the propaganda campaign Hamas launched 30 years ago — the FBI recorded them on wiretaps discussing their plans to deceive leftists and college kids into supporting them through framing the conflict using exactly the words and concepts you’ve used here back in the 90’s — actually worked. 

I’m sure they are thrilled to see the effect this propaganda campaign has had on people they very much consider to be useful idiots."
Ignorant baseless bullshit. GJ showing how little you actually know about the actual history as well as your anti-Semitic bias in 2 paragraphs.
"Hamas is one thing, but the PA? Really? They're the compliant ones. 

In any case, I wouldn't oppose aid and contributions being sent to relief organizations that help Israelis. I am talking about birthright and shit."
until they prevent you from getting home or to your destination.
"No, we have laws that ensure you can't just do anything you want, literally. You can't support terrorism and incite to violence"
"Canada condemned Hamas by themselves like they should have but it is a good thing that they did not join on that bullshit giving Israel carte blanche to do what they did afterward : 

>All five countries issued a joint message on Monday to express their “steadfast and united support to the State of Israel” and vowed to “remain united and coordinated, together as allies, and as common friends of Israel, to ensure Israel is able to defend itself”."
The current Israeli minister of National Security for Israel is a convicted terrorist (no joke look it up). So not that high a step.
I'd put war crimes and terrorism on par.
Hamas has been in power since like 2006. The issue with Palestinians being denied rights and freedoms and having their own state has been around for far longer. Hamas is a symptom of the occupation and conflict. It's not the cause of the unrest.
"Uh, this one. Oh wait I forgot if it happened more than a month ago you people don't think it happened.

You really need to stop throwing around the word “genocide”. You are not doing your argument any favours by misusing it. You are actually dumbing down the meaning.
"Umm no we didn’t, unless you have a different source to mine. Canada sold arms worth $21m in 2022."
"Israel is destroying Palestine, not just Hamas, that is the #1 reason why some people disagree with helping them"

"It's sticky to say anything about this without being labeled racist/anti whatever. So, I've opted out of that circular conversation. A lot of people feel that way. There is nothing a Canadian citizen can do. 

There is absolutely no way to reason with any of the leaders in that area as a citizen of North  America. Be real. You can't do anything except yell at the sky. Or someone who disagrees with you. Not a single thing."
Free Palestine from Israel and Hammas?
"Maybe not, but 4700 kids are dead at the hands of Israel and 14800 civilians with 7000 missing is pretty horrendous. Call that what you will."
Just moving the Democracy Star near Alderaa- I mean Gaza - right Darth?
LOL yeah ok.
"You’re referring to a 'concept paper' proposing transferring Gaza civilians to Egypt's Sinai, with Canada as a POSSIBLE final destination?"
"I’m not going to disagree with you, he held up the map. But genocide is still being used incorrectly."
Thank you for confirming that no genocide is taking place according to the UN.
"I've heard that, but have seen nothing proving it"
"They just gave them $50 million, very recent news"
An honest question with the maturity of someone who probably still plays with Pokémon.
"Yes and it’s bad, when Israeli does it it’s bad and when Hamas does it’s bad. That’s as far as my opinion goes. I think it’s time for white western countries to stop trying to police the rest of the world. Outside of the pretty standard stuff like don’t kill civilians OFC"
"One has been doing it for far longer and that needs to be stated, Israel’s actions led to the rise of Hamas. I’d rather we only contribute to humanitarian aid whether it’s Israeli/Palestinian or work towards peace. If we’re not doing anything like that then we shouldn’t send any money there."
"well that's a big part of the issue isn't it?  multiple nation/cultures in the area are utterly convinced that theirs is the one true anointed cause, and all others must conform or die.  There can be no peace in that environment."
"Yes, because Egypt understands that the Isreali plan is to push the people of Gaza into Egypt and steal the land. 

The pro-Israel crowd wont be able to fool the canadians for much more time. The internet is pulling the curtain and we see the land stealing plan for what it is."
Israel won't allow aid in via Egypt.
"Jews were forcibly removed by the IDF in 2005 to make way for the barrier and the 1km buffer zone between the barrier and Gaza. 

It was for their protection as the IDF would not be protecting them inside the barrier. And all those settlers were compensated by Israel.

How many Palestinians have been compensated when Israel forcibly removed them from their land?"
">Might want to look up how that worked out for Jordan in 1970.  And Lebanon from 1975 to 1990.

I'm aware of Black September and it doesn't deter my support for bringing Gazan refugees to Canada."
">surrounding Arab countries give a pittance in aid compared to Europe and the west

We don't have money. That's the reality. Countries that genuinely support Palestine, like Egypt, Lebanon, and Iran are economic Pariah states that have no money. The only small exception is Jordan, and the only difference is they're not economically isolated. Still pretty much broke though.

The Khaleeji states are against the Muslim brotherhood and therefore against Hamas by extension. They wouldn't be willing to give them a bent penny.

The only exception is Qatar.

>they use Israel as a front so they can blame it all Israel

Not really. Most Arab states are content to watch Palestinians suffer in silence, it's their people's common opinion that forces them to act somewhat.

>the rest of the world is taking in refugees by the millions but Arab nations (sure Jordan has many Palestinians) do little in the way of monetary aid, peacekeeping and accepting refugees

Egypt wants to send aid, but it's not allowed in. Lebanon has 400,000 Palestinian refugees. Syria 500,000. Jordan 2 million like you mentioned. They literally cannot handle more, especially with their economies being shit.

There's also the fact that they were promised they could return, a right which has utterly failed to materialise. Why would they trust it'll be temporary this time too?

>its pathetic

Yes. Governments in the Arab world are pathetic. Had they not been, this issue might have had the chance to be solved 100s of times."
"Pretty sure Canada isn’t going to be doing any persuading with force. Might send a hospital ship to support. Oh, hang on, we don’t have one."
">persuaded with force if necessary to stay out of Arab affairs.

If this becomes a reality,  you should be enlisted to go fight."
"Yes, some people are not neutral."
"I don't see much headlines, outside of TikTok (which is fairly radical left) and Reddit headlines trying to spread the protests.

In my city some students are planning a walkout today to demand Canada call for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. So thats mostly been spread on Reddit lately."
"I have seen it in my city and it’s mostly the same groups over and over again.  I live in a relatively small city compared to other major cities.  Maybe it depends on where you live and how much you pay attention to things going on in your city.  

My original comment is mostly anecdotal so feel free to disregard it."
Armchair Reddit historian take. Most actual historians will say this is a complex intractable conflict with no good side. It's why a neutral take is the only one even remotely backed by history.
"These people just want to bury their heads in the sand and parrot the sentiment that Jews and Israel are ""racist apartheid colonizers that stole their land"". They don't want peace, they want to rid the Middle East of Jews, and then conquer and impose Sharia law on the entire world. Seriously, the only reasons anyone would support them are: 1) they are completely ignorant of historical and religious context, 2) they also hate Jews, and/or 3) they themselves are Islamic fundamentalists."
Lol. I’m talking present day facts and now you wanna go back to look at mythology?
The PA is also incredibly corrupt. Abbas is estimated to be worth over $100 mil.
That's the price of freedom
Supporting Palestine does not equal supporting terrorism.
"Do you really think the 12-14k dead with 70% women rest children (numbers provided by hamas) are just civilians.  Like 0 combattants are in there? And do you believe hamas is just men over 18, like they don’t employ women or children under 18 ?  Oki"
Carte blanche eh sure another one that thinks that IL is bombing indiscriminately. You’re probably going to use the word carpet bombing too. Good lord
"Sure Israel has done all kinds of fucked up shit, every nation has, but hamas was explicitly created to destroy the state of Israel, they have no intentions of negotiating, they want Israel gone.

I personally believe Israel has a right to exist, so it’s easy to figure out who to support."
"They can be but in this particular case nah. 

Hamas is not on the same level, their openly stated goal is the destruction of Israel…not a peace deal or some form of compromise, it’s 100% all Jews gone from Israel.

People forget what Hamas actually stands for because of misplaced sympathy to the weaker side."
"I'm happy you've learned to walk and chew gum. Although it's not clear which river you speak of.

And I doubt you actually give any fraction of a fuck about Yemen"
Wake me up when we start selling weapons and trading with them.
"Sure. As a secular state that respects human rights regardless of ethnicity or religion. Why not?

For that to happen they would have to stop electing fascists though."
just disappointed
"If you want to be taken seriously.

"PPs top guy, the person who created Canada Proud, is an extreme supporter of Israel. It’s to the point where he personally requested bomb shells with his name to be dropped on Gaza. 

https://x.com/atRachelGilmore/status/1728086752290566273?s=20

Canada will loose all semblance of even remote impartiality if PP became PM."
"I mean, if the leader of the country agreed with me all the time, of course that's what I'd want."
"The crowd loved her, not sure what else to tell you."
"I'm guessing you either think genocide only refers to the industrialized form that was practiced by the Nazis, which is factually wrong, or you're not aware that this notion is supported by a vast array of [international scholars and law experts](https://web.archive.org/web/20231117143548/https://twailr.com/public-statement-scholars-warn-of-potential-genocide-in-gaza/). 

Either way, you don't know what you're talking about. Drop the pretense and inform yourself."
"true.  many palestian people have had an incredibly horrific time as the idf has been hunting hamas.  thousands of people have died and their homes destroyed to rubble.  fact is a fact.

the number #xxx why people agree with israel is that we can not cave to terrorists.  freedom is exceedingly important to educated western people.  hamas holding palestinians captive is no longer tolerable."
"Should have clarified sarcasm, my bad"
Bud israel has the means and motivation to completely wipe out Gaza many times over and they're not. If they intended to wipe out the Palestinians they would have already.
"Russia is currently a threat to Canada as it was much of the 1900’s. They are also an arctic rival and have been at war with our allies.
As well as Canada being in nato which is literally an anti Russian alliance.

The situation in Ukraine isn’t comparable to the Middle East."
"We do have a stake in the Ukraine war. Russia is always meddling in our Arctic, and fighting a proxy war to weaken Russia’s military without putting Canadians lives at risk is to our benefit."
You should ask the prairies with our massive fuckin Ukrainian diaspora over whether they have a stake at all in Ukraine. We have a pretty big cultural tie to the country by virtue of them making up like 12% of the prairie population. So it makes sense why so many support it.
"We absolutely have a stake in the Ukraine war. We are economically, socially, culturally, and militarily integrated with Europe and have geopolitical disputes with Russia in the arctic."
We have far more of a stake in Ukraine than we do Israel given the arctic and Russian constantly poking at it.  We're also part of nato.
"6,000 children have been killed by Israel since Oct 7 according to the UN https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-reported-impact-day-48"
Then don't bring it up.
"That's a ridiculous definition. You absolutely can depose a democratic state. The CIA has done it countless times.

I mean, I wasn't gonna go *there*"
"We can withhold military and economic support until the Knesset  comes up with a realistic, long term peace plan. For instance."
You're damn right. Free Palestine.
"This appears to be the newest narrative. There's nothing to be done! Go back to watching Marvel movies!

I'll stop barking up your tree when my prime minister stops condemning peaceful humanist movements like BDS, like the well trained dog he is."
That's a pleonasm. [Hamas is a tool of Israel](https://theintercept.com/2018/02/19/hamas-israel-palestine-conflict/).
I call it a brutal war against an enemy that hides among women and children.
War. That's called War.
"…made by the Israel government. 

I feel like you’re putting some stuff in quotations and all caps to try and poke holes in this and you’re not doing a good job of it. 

What’s the difference between a “concept paper” and a “plan” to you? They’re both details of this idea in concept. It’s “possible” (only existing in concept) because they can’t do it without 1) the agreement of the Palestinian people to go and 2) the agreement of the Canadian government to welcome them. Doesn’t change the fact that the ISRAELI GOVERNMENT’S REFUGEES PLAN CONSISTED OF SENDING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PALESTINIAN REFUGEESS TO ‘CANADA’."
Is ethnic cleansing more correct then? Would ethnic cleansing work?
"No, you're right. We should wait for all the Palestinians to either be killed or kicked out of Gaza, and then we can show our solidarity while doing nothing 🤷‍♂️"
"And thank you for dispelling any airs of your objectivity.

"So no sources, got it.."
"They gave it to 2 million starving dehydrated homeless civilians . Hamas can't drink all that water.
And it's $25 pp, it won't go far. It may be more like $30 pp soon, at the rate Israel is killing."
"Uh it's more that Israel is a settler colonial project championed by the West specifically as a military stronghold to keep the region unstable and prevent any communist ideology seeping through. It's not a religious thing, that's just a convenient pretext to good ol' geopolitics. Most sects of Islam then were comparably moderate compared to now."
"If Israel wanted to take Gaza, they could have done it many times in the past. They certainly wouldn't have withdrawn the IDF and uprooted 9000 settlers back in 2005 if that was their plan."
"Yeah, they wanted to ""steal the land"" so badly that Israel completely withdrew from Gaza in 2005 in exchange for peace (which never happened btw, thanks Hamas). Oh and they wanted to ""steal the land"" so badly that they gave the entire Sinai Peninsula to Egypt in exchange for a peace deal. But Egypt wouldn't take back the Gaza Strip for some strange reason. Can't put my finger on it."
Egypt is jailing Palestinians who want to leave for their own good?
"They've had the blocade in place for a lot longer than the current flare up. Israel had the entire Sunnai peninsula at one point.
Even if you're right on Israel's plan - how does maintaining the blockade do anything except harm the people living in Gaza?"
"They don't want Palestinians in their countries because every single one of them have been burned by accepting Palestinian refugees in the past. Read up on your fkin basic facts and history, you ignorant troll. Palestinians tried to overthrow the government/monarchy of every single country that accepted them like Egypt and Jordan, and were a major contributing factor to the civil wars in Lebanon and Syria. They helped the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait when seeking refuge there. Seriously learn some fkin history before you come spew your ignorance."
">Yes, because Egypt understands that the Isreali plan is to push the people of Gaza into Egypt and steal the land. 

Why should innocent civilians not be allowed to flee if they want to?

How can you seriously say this and not see that Egypt is clearly using these innocent civilians as pawns to achieve the outcome that they desire?"
Then you're a fool for not learning from history.
"thanks for that information 

i really hope that if anything good is to come from this miserable war it involves the surrounding nations being forced to be a real part of the solution 

because this conflict now demands some kind of solution or at least some kind of way to stop needlessly killing innocent people

though at this point i have no freaking idea what that might be"
"I was referring to NATO as a whole, I am sure that the Americans are quite capable of bringing freedom and democracy to Iran."

Yes.  The ones who go out on our streets and vociferously support' Palestine - *they're* not neutral."
Is Tik Tok radical left? I thought it was just short clips of attention seekers doing  weird things or trying to sell crap so the Chinese could harvest data.
"I know, you're exactly correct. The media are guilty of trying to spin the ""land grab, or Palestinian plight"" while ignoring the atrocities Hamas has committed. In almost every interview with an Israeli, they are continually forced to defend the actions they have taken, and yet the interviewer neglects or side steps the question of Hamas   and the hostages, or the atrocities they have committed.
It's sickening"
Sun Wukong told me that we needed to conquer 72 locations to then unlock all the 72 Earthly transformation and achieve immortality. Do you people even read about history?
"They sure are, selling out their people to Israel like that."
Not really.
"No, it's not. Your right to protest doesn't supercede all other rights. You can't kill someone as a form of protest then say ""but I have a right to protest"". 

That logic follows all the way down to even minor interference in the rights of others. As the saying goes, ""Your rights end where mine begin""."
"What? No I don't believe that the IDF have killed only civilians, but I believe that they killed a lot of civilians. When we talk about the victims of the 7th no one start claiming that they were not all civilians and that some of them were IDF like if it somehow justify the atrocities committed."
"Ok so you don't believe those number, what is the correct count? Also are yo6 suggesting no innocents have been killed or wounded by the IDF dropping buildings on them? All of them were terrorists?"
People forget Israel funded Hamas to destabilize the PLO and create an extremist environment where a two state solution wasn't possible. That the PM's party enshrined from the river to the sea in their founding.
The problem is there is way too much history here. It's a decades old conflict.
Your fallcy is conflating Hamas and Palnestinians.
">And I doubt you actually give any fraction of a fuck about Yemen

59% of Yemeni kids under 5 were considered malnourished in 2022.  No protests,   no fancy chants.

200,000+ people have died,  20+ million are considered food insecure because of the destruction caused by the Saudi intervention and blockade.

No fancy chants,  no protests,  no calls for a ceasefire,  no care for the children dying.  

People have a weird fetishization for Palestinian suffering that just transcends logic.   And most will stop caring about them by spring next year."

Huh. Looks like it didn't work. You must be *very* disappointed now.
the guy named Silent Cheesecake-89 is saying I won't be taken seriously lol.  Boy the irony is dripping.
That's not an indication of anything.
It doesn’t matter what I think really or what you think. I’m pretty sure no world leader has you on speed dial to check in on what they should do.
Don't forget those numbers are sourced from the Hamas run health department of Gaza
Huh? Wtf are you talking about? You accused me of looking at snuff and I corrected you. Still weird your mind went there.
"What's ridiculous about the definition if you claim it can and should be done ? 

You showed how you view the world, own it.

And when you depose (by the hand of God I guess, no country can do that to Israel) a government, it's got to be replaced by something."
"It's not a new narrative. What YOU gonna do? Fly over there and pick up a weapon? That's direct action. Anything else is just words against huge organizations and people who do not want to hear it. Go back to marvel? I watch the news and it's disheartening to say the very least. It's not apathy but there is only so much distressni can feel towards a war which cannot be argued against or for. Words are the losers here. Actions are all that work and every demonstration is not doing much to stop any thing that is happening. 

Prove me wrong and show me where words are stopping this from continuing?"

Interesting
"And it’s plain to see your bias, Infact it blatant. Let’s not go down the road of IDF atrocities, I can’t be arsed to bombard you with facts data and evidence of how they conduct business."

And who controlled Gaza?
"A simple www.canada.ca shows $50 million on 21 October, 2023. 
Stop with the all high and mighty behind your keyboard. Do a little bit of research yourself.
That is not the only ""contribution"" from the citizens of Canada to Gazans, who are controlled by Hamas, a terrorist organization"
I guess you really don't watch any news
"The international community gives Gaza $1.4 billion annually. There are 2.3 million Gazans. What does Hamas do with all that money? 
It's fact Hamas took the piping intended for desalination to make rocket launchers, which they target Israel with, DAILY. They've dug over 300 km's of tunnels under Gaza, which they didn't do for free. 
Israel supplies over 30% of the drinking water to Gaza, which they have never turned off. 
In the meantime, the media reported, since 7 October that Gazan hospitals were ""running out of fuel, and only had 24 hours left!"" That 24 hours was reported for over 21 days. The UN has a warehouse in Gaza, with food and fuel the whole time this false claim was made. 
Again, the question is, which all those that oppose the right of Israel to defend itself and her citizens refuse to answer, what is Israel supposed to do? Just sit back and allow Hamas to lob rockets daily onto Israeli citizens? 
If your neighbor constantly fired rockets at your house with the intent to kill you, what would you do?"
It was not the plan in 2005. It is the plan now. It's what the Likud has been deceitfully trying to make happen.
"Because they couldn't push the population into Egypt so they made it an overground prison with no economic prospect and severely curtailing any economic industry even thriving or existing, even agricultural industry fail in comparison to Israel."
"There are 2 reasons.

First, if they take in the refugees then there’s a really high chance that Israel won’t ever let them back in.  This would make Egypt and any other surrounding countries complicit in assisting the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. Second, having more Palestinians in their countries would have a tendency to destabilize them as they pressure these governments to do more in support of Palestine in opposition to Israel’s geopolitical interests.  

A lot of Israel supporters are using the argument - “see, nobody wants to help the Palestinians” as some kind of evidence that Palestinians are unreasonable and undesirable in order to justify their treatment of Palestinians, much like noe-Nazis used the fact that many western countries turned away boatloads of Jews escaping 1930s Germany to try to justify the holocaust, as if to say ‘the Jews are a problem for everybody - see, the Nazis were doing the world a favour”.  It’s victim-blaming.

Edit: grammar"
"There will be no solution as long as there is a right wing Israeli government that publicly wants to annex Palestinian territories.

The same is true as long as Hamas rules Gaza and plans to wipe Israel off the map. 

The only one of these I could reasonably see changing is Israel, but even then, Hamas will approach peace knowing it plans to break it as soon as it is convenient.

The two state solution is dead for now, and no one with any power is interested in reviving it."
"The USA was quite capable of removing freedom and democracy from Iran in 1953, but the reverse would be much harder.  See the failure in neighboring Afghanistan."
"I can’t quite work out if you’re being serious or not? Given how hard the Americans have been working to keep Iran from escalating the situation in the Middle East, I really don’t think there’s an appetite to march to Tehran in the name of freedom and democracy."
"> quite capable of bringing freedom and democracy to Iran.

They did a bang up job in 20 years in Afghanistan."
I don't know if there has ever been a neutral protest. That would be a sight to see.
Is this some sort of weird attempt to try and make the accepted neutral position something that is not neutral ?
The people on the street supporting Israel are also not neutral
Why should they be?
"If our government wants to be neutral as a genocide occurs that's their prerogative, citizens have no such expectation to be ""neutral"" as atrocities happen."
"Sir, you have an uncanny knack for stating obvious truths. A skill that I'm sure will serve you well in your life. Kudos."
"Unfortunately its become very aggressive, and effective tool for spreading whatever message you want.

The algorithm gets you trapped into a bubble very quickly, and very effectively as it seems to also use the fact that someone else on your network interacted with whatever video.

Theres a huge portion of very far-left individuals basically using it to attack any other positions than theres. (Far right do it too, but I'm much less likely to see that lately) and every video there is multiple comments about ""from the river to the sea"" and what not.

Now that I say that, its not really far-left, but effective for bots and misinformation campaigns. TikTok is really more dangerous than anyone is really giving them credit for I think.

We should ban TikTok."
I love how in a conversation about the West Bank you twisted your way back to hamas and Palestine.
"That being said, Netanyahu and his far right-wing supporters and WB settlers are extremists too and need to be stopped. There are moral wrongs committed by both sides, but to even try to equate them is just asinine and painfully laughable."
"Hahahaha! Thanks for the laugh. I had zero clue what you were talking about but I looked up the Monkey King and - holy shit! What a legend! He can go 54,000km in one somersault."
I mean the other option is they beat the protestors into submission and physically remove them?
"What are you nuts. Civilians die in war it’s a travesty, war sucks. Guess who wanted war tho, the murderous cunts called Hamas, who broke the ceasefire Oct 6 (and again last night 15min past midnight)

Gtfoh"
Sure and the us funded the taliban at some point too…does not make the 9/11 acceptable.
Explain to me where I conflated the two?
It would actually be conflating Israel and Jews
"I know this. 

But have we established direct trade with the Yemeni government allied with Saudi Arabia? Do we consistently vote with their Saudi backed government in UN, regardless of whether they're right or wrong? Do we vote to prevent international investigations in Yemen? 

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not denying we shouldn't be selling weapons to them. We protest against Saudi Arabia for a reason. They weren't as widespread, but they existed.

Still, these situations are not equal. Canada is much more deeply involved with Israel and refuses to so much as condemn illegal settlements."
"The current government of Israel, lead by Benjamin Netanyahu. Open fascists.

"It's a reddit name genius, a random generated name."
"The only reason Israel is negotiating a humanitarian pause with Hamas is because they were pressured by the US government into doing so. The only reason the US government pressured the government of Israel to negotiate is because of public opinion in the west.

The UN says Gaza's Health Ministry is accurate. Keep in mind that the UN has lots of employees working in Gaza.
"> What's ridiculous about the definition if you claim it can and should be done ? 

I'm saying your added condition is stupid. All it takes to depose a state is a force it can't contend with.

"We elect state officials, who appoint diplomats, who represent us in a variety of nations and international organizations. These people are beholden to us.

I repeat : please stop watching Marvel movies. They are poisoning your brain. There are no superheroes in this world. All we have is collective action."
"Correct. Hamas today is [blowback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowback_(intelligence\)). 

The importance of Hamas' origins however, lies in the fact that it was created as a foil to secular and leftist Palestinian of the time. It's part of the reason why Gazans aren't the perfect westernized secular victims that we'd like them to be, and also why it's so easy for Israel to smear them in front of deeply islamophobic western audiences."
"Of course I'm biased. I'm biased in favour of the democratic home of the Jewish people and against the people who have wanted to destroy that home since before it even came into existence.

After you're done sharing your facts about the IDF, perhaps you can do the same with other military forces around the world. Or is it just the IDF you have a problem with?"
"Lol I never said it was going to happen. I said it was the Israeli government’s plan and then cited the source. You’ve done nothing to disprove anything, just tried to be condescending and poke holes unsuccessfully.

This was in response to you saying that they don’t care about Canada’s stances in the conflict. If they want/need to use us and see us as a part of the means to their ends, which they do if they are including us as part of plans they are considering, then they wouldn’t be completely indifferent. 

Have a nice day."
"
Israel is conducting indiscriminate bombing of a civilian population."
Yup we'll only call it a genocide or ethnic cleansing after Israel is successful then we can all feel bad about it

That's for humanitarian aid and the federal government has already said they're going to ensure that none of the money goes to Hamas. Stop lying 'word word number'.
Why would I watch mainstream news when it's literally all right-wing propaganda?
Well they are probably done with Hamas rockets being fired into Israel and with Hamas using ceasefire to re arm and attack.
They still don't want Gaza. But this government has decided that they can't leave Hamas in control of it any longer either.

edit to add: One thing that is different about those other places is that you'd never hear them refer to their countries as a ""prison""."
">First, if they take in the refugees then there’s a really high chance that Israel won’t ever let them back in.  This would make Egypt and any other surrounding countries complicit in assisting the ethnic cleansing of Gaza.

This is an absurd take. Allowing refugees who want to flee a war to do so in no way makes you complicit in that war. 

On the other hand, if innocent civilians want to leave the war zone and you refuse to let them do so, I do think you are at least partially complicit if those people are killed or injured."
"right

the only possibility is that those in the “middle” exert enough pressure 

the settlements must go and i think that is possible 

would that pressure hammas to stop and hezbollah and iran ?

i doubt it

it will take the whole world working to fix this conflict"

the other option is protesting so you don't prevent people from getting home?.    Why such an extreme response?.
">Canada is much more deeply involved with Israel and refuses to so much as condemn illegal settlements.

Saudi Arabia is our second biggest trading partner.   We couldn't even muster the courage to condemn what was being done to Yemenis by the Saudis lol.

It's literally the same thing.

>Still, these situations are not equal.

More Yemenis have died in the Civil War and the Saudi intervention in 2015 than Palestinians have by IDF hands in the last 30 years.   Possibly even more.  4.5 million Yemenis have been displaced in comparison to the 1.7ish million in Palestine.

It's crazy the lengths people go to fetishize Palestinian suffering when others are suffering equally or even moreso.  I do not get it."
"I mean.. there have been many governments of Israel and no resolution. Pretty sure the next guy also isn’t gonna want his country destroyed. Palestinians were offered 95% of asks under Olmert. No peace. 

The Israelis for all their faults have put offers on the table. They managed in the past to give land for peace with other counties like Egypt. 

The Palestinian leadership doesn’t seem to want anything other than the full dismantling of Israel. And maybe they are right, maybe they are not but it ignores the reality of their situation. Israel has nukes. They aren’t going anywhere. Either get the best deal for your people or continue to live as in perpetual conflict."

Israel isn't a fascist State. But I guess it's cooler using buzzwords.
"Where did you get Marvel movies from? Project much? That shit is drivel and for distraction. 

We are in the era where leaders do as they please. Well, they've been doing that for a while but it is blatant now a days. Not to be completely cynical but leaders in our own countries do what the wealthy want in order to line their pockets and get those big buck pensions.  It's tragic and comedic at the same time."
"I have a problem with any force killing children on mass, only a nationalist would  think that’s acceptable! Nazi types."
I actually didn’t think this was your point. You’re actually worried that Israel will send hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to Canada?
I agree with you
You’re delusional it’s not going to happen
It was never their intention in the past that funds get to Hamas and yet it still did. Because they claim otherwise means nothing
"No point in trying to differentiate. Too many black and white people in this discourse, which is part of the problem with it all. 

The person you’re responding to has already decided that the Palestinian people and Hamas are synonymous."
"Lol and you think the feds will be able to actually monitor and ensure that happens? What are they going to do if or when Hamas appropriates it?

Not too mention, by providing humanitarian aid they are indirectly assisting Hamas. That's resources Hamas won't have to spend on their own people and can redirect more of their own resources/money towards weapons"
"Yeah, ok"
Can you perhaps some sources you've used to shape your view of this conflict?
"😅😀 I think you're watching from the wrong wing. 
Further, Canada gave $25 million to Gaza in 2021 and has contributed $35 million annually since 2015. 
Hamas has rulled Gaza since 2006 and has been the recipient of $4.5 billion in international aide annually.
Besides digging terror tunnels, and using piping meant for water desalination to fire rockets against the ONLY democratic nation in that region, what has Hamas done for the citizens of Gaza?"
"Lol Egypt is just like any other country that has its own challenges. So would you be okay with allowing MILLIONS of refugees in Canada to flee the war? If you say no, Canada shouldn’t, then I hope you understand how much of a hypocrite you are.

Israel is not a normal country where palestenians, generations down, can NEVER EVER return home (But Jacob from Long Island can claim land and a Palestinian home, kicking out indigenous people-besides the point but also shows how unjust that country is).

Throw in the fact that Israel leaders and official ministers publicly claim the need to displace ALL Gazans and take the land themselves, naturally makes makes Egypt’s position to send aid in vs take in millions of people."
"I didn’t say it would make Egypt complicit of the war, but rather complicit in the ethnic cleansing of Gaza.  

If the Egyptians know that the Palestinians won’t be allowed back to Gaza, and they take them… then they know Gaza will have been ethnically cleansed.  One could argue that it would likely ‘encourage’ Israel to exile even more of them to Egypt’s."
"Hezbollah have proven they are capable of maintaining peace. I've lived in a border village. Used to get pretty close to the fence regularly, and I'm not any worse off for it. The situation is calm most of the time. The UN enforced line is a good enough situation that I'd be comfortable living there my whole life if it wasn't for Hezbollah generally being conservative as hell and the economic crisis.

Iran doesn't really care about fighting Israel, despite their propoganda, what they want is political proxies. They're intent on having a group that achieves their goals on someone else's soil.

That's what Hamas would be to them if they could achieve a Palestinian state. They'd benefit more from a Hamas with political leverage, rather than as is.

The stumbling block would be Hamas's ties to Qatar and the Muslim Brotherhood, ideologues who see Hamas as one of their own, and have made their entire purpose uniting Muslims to destroy Israel (nevermind that this would take us all out in a nuclear blast).

The settlements need to go, and Israel needs to give up Area C, a block that is genuinely crucial for their defense against Jordan, but composes the majority of the west bank.

Honestly at this point, I'd cut Hamas loose and negotiate peace with the PA, but Israel knows they can take the entire West Bank if they play it right and Arab leaders do not care enough to do anything about it. They're not the only ones.

America and NATO support Israel as long as the PR doesn't get too bad, and that's how we get to a paralysed slow settling state."

not really much a protest that way is it? Ever protest that enacts change comes from making things difficult for someone or everyone
"You're giving only options that u personally want, and not what reflects the reality.  Like if something is currently happening, the option of (go protest elsewhere) doesn't align with reality, because they don't have to listen to you.  What is your option if they respond with ""no"".  So, therefore the only actual option is to remove them by force..."
"I am not comparing their suffering, I am comparing this countries stance on it. Which is the only thing I can realistically change.

Protesting against ties with Saudi Arabia because they help kill people in Yemen is like protesting against ties with America because they help kill people in Palestine. It is not the equivalent of protesting ties with Israel for Israel's direct involvement of killing people in Palestine.

Besides that, our biggest trading partners are actually the US, the EU and China.

I don't ""fetishize suffering"", I support Palestine because my grandma was Palestinian. Purely emotional reasons. Always have been, always will be.

Which is actually not really your concern. I have the right to protest against what I like, and my priorities are entirely human ones, I don't need to have a reason to look at a protest and think ""you know why I shouldn't join this? Because other people are suffering!"""
"Negotiations broke out with Olmert because he was on his way out of office. Any deal struck would therefore be meaningless if there was nothing to keep Israel accountable to it. 

It's not very well known or understood the extent to which Israel violates its own treaties. The West Bank is spattered with illegal settlements that are protected by Israeli military and police personnel. It's the exact same strategy the Americans were using to remove Natives from their land, and it's not a coincidence. So, when people like you blame Palestinians for not accepting deals that they know damn well aren't going to be respected anyway, it's especially disgusting."
"That's the job of Israeli citizens, and I suppose it's a good thing that he is currently sitting at 42% public support. 

In any case, when leaders of sovereign states are committing atrocities, we normally resort to economic sanctions. If we can do it to Putin, we can sure as hell do it to Bibi. 

Seriously man, every angle you try is a total dud."

The reality is that you are part of history. You are the traffic during rush hour. You are the line at the supermarket. 

In any case, I find that ""it's all fucked, we can't do anything anyway"" is a position people retreat behind when the discourse doesn't go their way. Surely you came to this comment section for a reason. Surely you have *some* motive beyond scolding people for wanting to do something about it."
"I have to think you’re intentionally misrepresenting what I’m saying because I’m not sure I could spell it out any clearer than in my last comment that you just responded to making something up entirely in its stead. 

I’m good to drop it here if you are."
">You’re actually worried that Israel will send hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to Canada?

They have a plan to do so and a motive to do so.  So it makes sense to be worried that they will indeed try to do so."
You're delusional if you're not believing what the government of Israel is saying right to everyone's faces
"Yes, by all means, let them starve. They deserve it for daring to exist."
Absolutely unhinged
"So to you all Palestinians = Hammas, got it..."
"""Egypt doesn't want refugees"" is a very different argument than what the other person was saying."
Do you put any value on human life or individual rights?
"great points thanks

yeah, pretty much of the autocrats in the region hate hamas, pij, and the muslim brotherhood, isis etc ... they represent instability in a region that has no real economic engines or jobs for their people so they are perpetually in turmoil and any ""revolutionary"" group represents a threat

i am not sure i agree that israel will be able to take the west bank

the pa is apparently incapable of governing and everything i hear is that they are not an option for governing gaza

certainly it will be a struggle between left and right in israel but i think that the tide is slowly turning against israel in the west and will continue to turn against them

so if they unwisely choose to continue expanding settlements in the west bank they will face growing hostility worldwide

there needs to be real pressure from the middle around the world on both israeli's and palestinians to say ""find the middle and make it work""

having said that, it is truly like playing 3d chess blindfolded to find a solution"

And all of these protests aren’t really calling for a peaceful two state solution now, are they?  River to the sea. Intifada revolution. It’s all pretty clear. 

 Egypt and Jordan have signed peace treaties which have been respected.

Israel has shown its willingness to forcefully uproot Jewish communities from Gaza in order to appease Palestinians.  That didn’t go so swimmingly. Maybe they could have used Gaza as a model for a state instead of a terror hub. All that international aid could have done wonders."

Fucking CBC arab Nazi collaborationist filth. Tell the fucking story. It's fucking media like this that makes it possible for arab-loving Nazi genocidal ""Canadians"" to say ""oh, both sides are bad!""

Hamas gunned down 260 people at a rave, then went door-to-door murdering families in a small town. That is not ""several Israeli sites""."

Because being a canadian citizen is an asset whenever you need a service.
"Because her daddy is a developer there. She seems to be in the news a lot over the years talking about how bad it is in Gaza multiple times but has yet to leave. She also had her kids while living in Palestine. But now all of a sudden she’s calling for a rescue?

Religion.
Good question. No idea.
"People are allowed to visit family.  I've worked with several Palestinian children, and there's nothing illegal about visiting with the proper visas."
"Imagine after being rescued from Gaza, she ends up in Canada, where she have no home since she has been living there since 2014.  And then she sees the price of food here.  She'll be asking to go back within hours!"
"So she isn't allowed to visit family back home. What if they went to see their grandma or relatives? Why don't see ask why is Israel allowed to cut off food water and electricity to millions of people when majority of them are children (average age is 18)? Hospitals don't have electricity, how will they perform necessary medical operations? Why is the west watching genocide but also sending weapons to Israel instead of saying stop? How is it defending yourself to pretend to hit Hamas when you are intentionally targeting civilians"
"Canada should evacuate any Canadian in the area who can get to an airport where we are evacuating from. 

unfortunately for Canadians who chose to go to, and live in, an incredibly unsafe area where we have issued countless warnings there is unlikely to be a safe passage to an evacuation flight. Nowhere does it say that we are obligated to go bail every citizen out of their stupid choices in every situation."
Blaming this on Canada is laughable.
"Is Hamas welcoming Canadian evacuations?

Last I heard there are no consulates or offices in Gaza and I sincerely doubt Hamas is helping us coordinate evacuations like the Israel government.

It takes two parties to coordinate these.

Unfortunately there are limitations on what we can do when we are dealing with a state that is run by terrorists. I do feel for those in Gaza under terrorist oppression though."
"""humanitarians"" lol. Those are people that care about other people right?   


The lady in the article is in a city where people who murdered her fellow Canadians were celebrated. Where some of her fellow Canadians are being held hostage, possibly already executed. She isnt being subject to this torture, shes safe from it. Her concern? She ought to be safer so why havent we evacuated her yet?   


Is main character syndrome now called humanitarianism? Shes a level 2 priority. Level 1 priority is getting Canadian hostages out of there. After their release has been secured, the 100 or so Canadians living in Gaza(per the article) can then be prioritized for evacuation."

Well said"
"The irony is they were probably let into Canada at some point in their lineage due to no doubt 'escaping oppression or insecurity' at their place of origin. I don't get the need for people to be out of country half the time, but then again I come from a different era of immigration. There was generally nothing left for my ancestors from where they came from, and zero opportunity to shuttle back and forth at a whim."
It could be to visit family. That seems like the most likely reason.

It's because in the past the Gaza Palestinians have caused way more issues for Egypt than any additional money would solve.
"Why should Egypt be forced to take 2.3 million refugees who will never be allowed home?

Israel has never allowed Palestinians who are displaced to return home and Egypt knows this."
"Israel bombed the hell out of the Rafah crossing into Egypt yesterday. There's no way out. Also, Israel would never let them back in. It's Israeli policy that only Jews/Israelis have the right of return."
Didn't they get Canadian-Israelis out?
"Not only this, but I don’t believe there are any diplomatic ties to Gaza - pretty sure I heard Bill Blair on CBC today state that Canadians in Gaza have to communicate with the Canadian government to seek assistance and that the international community is working to get them out

I sincerely doubt that Hamas is cooperating and wants to have diplomatic ties with the west, even if for whatever reason we would even consider having diplomatic ties with a terrorist organization 

It’s like when people criticized the US for not taking in Afghan refugees when the Taliban literally would not let them leave"
So you oppose the Canadian evacuation of Israelis that happened earlier today?
"If they're a Canadian citizen, they should be aided. Period.

We're the country that has accepted them, they are one of our own now.  
Does Canada take care of their own?

Yeah scary, but at the end of the day, if you’re living there you made the ultimate decision and are now just using the dual citizenship, which they most likely havent paid canadian taxes in many years, when it’s convenient."
"Who would have thought Israel and Gaza would ever go to war. What a crazy and unpredictable mess. If only this happened every 5-10 years or so, maybe we would have seen it coming."
"It’s so sad and there are clearly limitations on what is possible, given we don’t have any offices or consulates in Gaza and we would effectively need to coordinate with Hamas to evacuate Canadians, which - let’s be real - is low odds of happening at this point."

"If they can get to the airport in Israel they would be more than welcomed onto flights. 

Unfortunately many of the people in Gaza who hold Canadian passports chose to live in Gaza instead of Canada even despite the clear danger and countless warnings from the Canadian government that it was not safe to be there and are now trapped. That was their choice and while I support offering them flights out if they can get to the airport and even working with various agencies like the UN to see if we can negotiate a safe passage for them to the airport I would not support us intervening to try to get them out with any kind of force."
Why would Trudeau release any hostages? /S
This subreddit has been pro Israel and kill Palestinians the whole week. I don't see much Canada news here
Canada lost it’s identity years ago so makes sense to me
Actually with a Canadian passport they could have fairly easily got out before it all started. Now though.... not a chance unless the Israelis make a deal with Hamas via the UN to allow foreign passport holders out.
"On a serious tone, could maybe use El Arish Int’l Airport in Egypt to get Palestinians out via the Rafah crossing.

Does that also apply to the ~~Israeli's~~ *Canadians* we spent millions rescuing?"

Visiting families rings a bell for you?
Possibly.
No another article said she’s been living in Gaza since 2014
"""Mathkour is a Palestinian Canadian living in Gaza with her two young children."" From the article, and suggests permanence. 🤷‍♂️"
"Another article said she’s been living there since 2014

https://beta.cp24.com/news/2023/10/12/1_6599420.html"
Been visiting family for nearly a decade apparently.

It's very relevant because it's fucking hard for the Canadian government to get people out of these places.
"Gaza is quite literally a terrorist enclave completely ran and administrated by Hamas.

No, you could not argue the same thing about a wartorn nation e.g. Ukraine."
"I didnt know I was asked a question, but thanks and btw gfy if you think you know anything about me. Gaza is portrayed as a shitty place to be. Why live there if you have choices, is all I was asking. Adios."
[removed]
"literally nothing you’ve said has any impact on the fact that Gaza is an open-air prison.

The anti-Palestine propaganda machine *has* been HARD at work convincing people of absurd things. 

I implore any of you to watch this video (on West Bank not Gaza) https://youtu.be/aEdGcej-6D0?si=jU7meRX5OQ8ZwzBf and tell me then if you think this apartheid is acceptable? And this video doesn’t even illustrate 1/100th of Israel’s worst war crimes against Palestinians, that video is just the every-day shit."
"Presumably China isn't described the same way as Gaza. Flights in and out, hotels and all that. Tourism."
Article says living and not visiting or staying. I would put the children deaths on hamas shoulder Las since it’s been widely know that they are using civilians as human shield. Please educate yourself
Bingo. Why the fuck did she move to Gaza in 2014?m with kids. If it’s so incredibly dangerous and if she had safety in Canada.

"A massive chunk of foreigners IN gaza are humanitarian.  

The lady in the article lives there with family.  This isn't disaster tourism. 

I refer to my original statement, way to be compassionate. You're an incredible Canadian, truly a paragon among us."
[deleted]
"I don't see that much unwavering support. I see quite a bit of criticism of Israel. But I think people are so angry at the slaughter and rape they witnessed that they are willing to accept many Palestinian civilian casualties to destroy Hamas. I do think public opinion will shift and people will demand more restraint from Israel, but I don't think Israel will listen. I think they will not stop until Hamas is destroyed, and only then will they start resuming humanitarian aid to Palestine. It's a very sad situation and I do worry about what the coming days will bring."
"Yeah the double standard is that they got Canadians out of a functioning country with an airport, unlike Gaza that is completely shut off. What do you want them to do, teleport her out of there? 

Not to mention how stupid do you have to be to move from Canada into fucking Gaza?"
"Have you tried polling non white Canadians and what they think of this? Outside your natural muslim jihadi brethren, rest of us multicultural canadians  too want Hamas to get fucked."
"Canadian white supremacists love jews?


That's a new one, I'll give you that"
I think seeing the pictures that came out went a long way in changing a lot of people's minds about Israel.
Where’s the apartheid?
"These same folks conveniently used those same muslims last week when it was useful to team up and complain about ""Parental Rights"" in schools... this week they are persona non grata..."
"Dude. Palestinians were literally cheering in triumph all around the world when they learned that their countrymen were beheading infants in Israel. I don't think anyone has sympathy for them anymore. Was this ""canadian"" in the street of Gaza cheering saturday during the attack, probably."
Where is your family from? Mine immigrated from Germany before the first world war.
"she is living there, it wasn't like she just happened to be in town visiting from a comfy house in Canada. She made the choice to move to and live in Gaza full time."
"According to an interview in 2021, this woman moved BACK to Gaza from Canada in 2021. 

https://x.com/itsginellamassa/status/1393386956189585408?s=20

Funny enough in this interview from 2 years ago, she’s also concerned about bombing that was happening at that time, yet still didn’t leave"
"She's apparently originally from Toronto. Your comment is not only bigoted and offensive, it's also shows you have no idea what you're talking about."
That might be the best case scenario.

So when are Syrians going back home?
"Israel literally tried to give them the strip, that's hardly displacement."
"Tbf Gaza Strip has been on the avoid all travel advisory even before this, not sure what they want to be done for them."
Hard to land a CF aircraft in Gaza under the threat of Hamas trying to capture or kill the crew
"They're getting them as far as from Tel Aviv to Athens, then they're on their own to make their own arrangements to come to Canada from there. Or wherever they're going. At least thats what I heard on Global News early this morning."
"I don't know, but I think they shouldn't be doing that either."
"AFAIK not yet, the Canadians that fled Israel did so via a private operator.

So, ya know, our Government just kind of sucks lol."
Ding ding ding. We all know why.
">So you oppose the Canadian evacuation of Israelis that happened earlier today?

I oppose the government getting involved with dual citizens in a country they are also citizens of. They aren't more Canadian than Israeli/Palestinians in this instance."
"Sure. There's no widespread threat of war throughout Israel so the evacuations seem odd. It's more appropriate for Canadians fleeing the area bordering on Gaza, where the recent incursion happened. 

But like people are ""fleeing"" Tel Aviv."
Canada doesn't really take care of their own.  Try to get medical care or housing in this country.
I'm going to jump in here and tell you what I believe the Canadian government should do. If the trip was a short term visit to family or a vacation ( although I don't think Gaza is a hot tourist destination) or a Canadian doing relief work. You better believe that they deserve our help. If that is their choice of residence ( Israel or Gaza) they should be responsible for getting out on their own dime. Poor decisions have consequences sometimes.
"there is no active airport in Palestine, so that presents a problem to get people evacuated by air. There’s been no airport there for almost 20 years. Their borders are sealed between Israel and Egypt."
How exactly do you propose Canada evacuate people from Gaza? Let's hear how you would do it.
">You're saying that Canada owes its Jewish citizens but not its Arab citizens.

No, I'm saying it doesn't owe anything to dual-citizens in their home country"
Maybe we can put them on the same flight?  Or maybe more exciting if separate flights and they can protest and fight in the airport?  Or Canadian streets?
"There isn't a double standard so much as they have no idea what the fuck they're doing. The Canadian government was telling Canadians in Israel to ""use the internet"" when Canadians were calling the embassy emergency line and that ""we don't do that"" when asked to help them get home. 

Frankly the embassy and associated Canadian agencies over there are inept in their entirety."
"TIL that because I don’t support terrorists I’m a white rural folk despite being an olive skinned middle easterner from Hamilton.

Guess I should start going to a Dutch Reform Church and driving a Ford F150 or something."
The vast majority of Canadians (almost 75%) live in large urban centres.
It’s only the brown ones bringing up race. That’s the only card to play.
"If only there was a travel advisory over the last few years that said, ""do not go there under any circumstances; we cannot bail you out."""
Seriously? There is a clear difference between how Hamas / Palestine Operates and how Israel operates. Ill give you a hint… the guys that murder and rape civilians with no clear military objective in mind are the bad guys.
"Yeah...you know that Israel won't let border crossings happen, right?

And that Israel bombed the shit out of the former Palestinian airport?

Of course you do...and that's why you're giving this great advice here.

Also, I work with Palestinian kids at my school and believe it or not, they're allowed to visit their family when there's no war happening.  They aren't all choosing to live there."
How does what u say make any sense?
It’s wild to me that this comment section has zero empathy. I’m not saying we should charter a 767 to go get them but the lack of empathy is just shocking…
That's frankly not a federal responsibility.
Yeah right. Thousands of them in my hometown
LMAO. You sure tell a lot of imaginary stories.
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
That same rubble here would go for 100k over asking.
"There is, however, a great deal more freedom movement (via checkpoints) between Palestinian areas/zones in the West Bank. People from Gaza are not allowed to leave Gaza."
"> I don't know what you're getting at

My point was more that the West Bank and Ramallah are developed and have more wealth invested into their infrastructure. They also benefit from Christian tourism as they basically own the Christian sites."
putting on a military uniform means you intent to commit a massacre?
Yes it totally does.
"The article said she’s living in Gaza, not there for tourism or visiting. Did you even read it?"
But how did they get in for a visit if it's an open air prison?
She's living in Gaza. Not visiting. Read the article.
Truly a Canadian citizen
Got a link or nah?
How is it relevant why she is there? The Canadian government has a duty to them being citizens. Public pressure on Israel to allow a humanitarian corridor instead of repeatedly bombing it would be a good start.
"Right, the infants in Gaza are terrorists. My bad."
"By that same adage, all Iranians are terrorists because their government are terrorists. WTAF? 2 million people live in  Gaza and most hate their government, but are held hostage by terrorists on the inside and unrealistic & problematic ruling regime on the outside."
How did it become that way if you don’t mind me asking? Or are people just born terrorists and extremists? If your answer to the second question is yes there’s no room for discussion here. (Half of the population in Gaza is children fyi)
"This and the inhabitants I'm sure all would claim to be suffering under heavy oppression by Israel, even under normal circumstances. Canada must have fallen several notches if a Canadian citizen would willingly choose *that* over *this*. 🤷‍♂️"
"The extreme right Israeli government are terrorists hell bent on ethnic cleansing.  Read up on the civilian body count they are responsible for.  Not to mention stealing their land, homes… so how about you educate yourself before making ridiculous claims based on your limited knowledge."
"yeah, the <1,000,000> 18 an under population of Gaza are totally terrorists… /s

get this racist shit out of here. disgusting, vile views."

"Her kids are both younger than 10. So born there. No mention of a husband. And per the article, she's been relocated 5 times since Saturday. Thats incredibly good treatment for a foreign citizen.   


And then I had my own bingo moment lol. Her husband works for Hamas. Thats why she was there building a life and having kids up until specifically right now, when its become clear that Hamas and anyone linked to them is likely to be arrested by Israel as they push through Gaza."
"You leave while the leaving's good.

My grandfather left Poland at 14 years old in his bare feet in 1929.  I'm pretty glad he did."
"She chose to live there, she wasn't just visiting for the week to see her family.... thats a very different situation."
"That they're in a war torn country is exactly the point. If they are and you want to visit cool, but you're on your own. No obligation."
"she chose to live in an incredibly dangerous place. There are literally too many warnings about how dangerous it is to visit let alone live in Gaza to count. Why on earth should we be bailing out everyone who makes incredibly stupid and dangerous decisions despite being warned over and over again not to? 

She knew the risks, she made a choice, now she is at the find out stage."

"The land grabs, the IDF killing unarmed civilians (including children), the settlers literally forcing Palestinians out of their homes because Israeli law says they have the right to do so, the Israeli citizens that throw rocks (and worse), etc. Palestinians are subject to regular, state sponsored violence and maltreatment. It's 100% an apartheid state with a good amount of authoritarianism and religious bullshit thrown in.

I'm in no way defending the actions of Hamas, because they are shit people but pretending like the Israeli government, IDF s and some of their own citizens are perpetuating violence and injustice. Heck, during the last major conflict in Gaza, Israel told civilians to evacuate, then bombed the literal only bridge out of the area, then bombed the shit out of schools, apartments, civil services (like hospitals) and news orgs killing many unarmed civilians while blaming Hamas for using them at human shields . 


So yeah, Hamas bad. Israeli govt not good either."
"Prominent leaders from South Africa (like Nelson Mandela and Ronnie Kasrils), former Israeli government and [intelligence officials](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/06/israel-imposing-apartheid-on-palestinians-says-former-mossad-chief?bshm=rime/2), international institutions, [human rights organizations](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution), and others around the world have described it as an apartheid state."
Ask an Israeli when's the last time they went through a military checkpoint. Then ask a Palestinian.
You can like one thing someone does and abhor another. It's human to engage in not hating literally everything someone else does. I'm sure you and I could agree on something

"half of Palestinians in Gaza are under the age of 18... 

first of all, don't even believe that the majority of palestinians would celebrate the deaths of israeli's but thats besides the point. i would like you to engage in some critical analysis for a second here and think to youself, why might it be that some Palestinians feel as though they have no choice but to support Hamas? Do you know literally *anything* about how Palestinians are treated?

do you know about the peaceful [Palestinian protest at the border](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%932019_Gaza_border_protests) where the idf shot hundreds of protestors? killing a bunch of kids, and celebrating back in 2018?

exerpt about that^ ""In late February 2019, a United Nations Human Rights Council's independent commission found that of the 489 cases of Palestinian deaths or injuries analyzed, only two were possibly justified as responses to danger by Israeli security forces. The commission deemed the rest of the cases illegal, and concluded with a recommendation calling on Israel to examine whether war crimes or crimes against humanity had been committed, and if so, to bring those responsible to trial."""

"I'm a mutt, lol. From Germany in the 1880s (via US) , Norway via US and Scottish in similar timeframe, maybe a bit earlier in the 1800s for the Scottish branch. They weren't monied of course, and didn't leave these places because it was going well. So they got here, *there were next to no government supports here*, they were on their own, and ties to the old country were basically cut off other than writing letters back there if you still had people there. Even the people with money back then didn't have much mobility. 

Immigrants are gamblers, moreso then and I'm guessing still today, obviously. It was learn the language, sink or swim. Go get a job if you have a skill or a strong back, maybe you scraped everything together for what it takes to go out to nowhere and try to farm.

How many of the current population voted for Hamas?  When was the last election?  What is the average age in Palestine?
When the US stops occupying 1/3rd of their country
Doesn't excuse the lack of contact to check on their well-being. That more so points to the Canadian government choosing to care only about certain groups of people in this country.
I guess Israel should have been on that list eh
"Makes no sense. Given the history, it's more likely that they would be shot down by Israeli aircraft."

You specifically want them to not be helped? What’s wrong with you?
I know. Which makes Israel’s call to the Palestinian civilians to get out of Gaza murderously cynical doesn’t it.
Get 26 troops killed or pay millions to Hamas I guess??
"They did not say it was easy, they said that Canada has the same obligation to all it's citizens, which shouldn't be controversial, but here we are apparently."
How about at least trying to get into contact with them? Negotiate or pressure Israel to open up a humanitarian corridor. Right now Israel has been bombing the humanitarian crossing to Egypt. Not a peep from the government. It's like they treat Jewish and Arabic Canadians differently.

Dont you find it odd that she considered herself safe through 8 years and hundreds of airstrikes, its only now that Israel is targeting 100% of Hamas that suddenly she needs to get out of there ASAP?   


Its all in the article. Shes had to ""relocate 6 times since Saturday"". Lifelong Gazans are homeless everywhere, and she, innocent foreign citizen, keeps getting shuttled to new quarters after having the bad luck 6 times in a row of Israel accidentally striking her quarters.   


Take a hint professor lol. Her husband works for Hamas. Probably in civil service or some other bureaucratic fashion."
"Yeah Israel isn’t going to let a bunch of people it can’t verify cross from an area where they are actively fighting terrorists into their nation. Frankly I can’t blame them for that since the risk would be high for little to no benefit to the Israelis.

The Canadians there are in Gaza in spite of countless warnings about the dangers of being in Gaza.

"In a weird way, Gaza has a bit more freedom of movement within Gaza strip borders, no checkpoints, surveillance or Israeli military.
This is the reason why Israel was so surprised by the attack - they don't surveil within Gaza borders and only rely on informants.

While the West Bank is a bit more developed, it's split by many different checkpoints, and travel between those checkpoints is not always possible. Additionally, there is the whole new level of surveillance technology, including face recognition and other nasty stuff similar to China."
"No, I phrased it weirdly. The guardian updates article says that some Israeli settlers in WB have opened fire on Palestinian villages (and did so in uniform). Presumably they were ex-military."
A very small number of people are allowed in or out by the Israeli government. I read somewhere like around 2000 or something. You can visit prisons you know.
Through Egypt with authorization from Israeli authorities.

"Yes I posted a link to a Tweet from 2021 from journalist Ginella Massa where it says “Asia Abu Mathkour moved back to Gaza from Canada in 2014.” Theres a video interview with Asia. 

That Tweet has since been deleted, but if you google Ginella Massa and Asia Mathkour you’ll see it archived in Google with the headline I mentioned above. 

Another article posted in this thread about Asia says her family or father are developers and own buildings in Gaza. 

This woman is clearly well connected - why does she of all people get featured so much in the media? Why would she go back to Gaza in 2014, and keep staying with kids there??"
">How is it relevant why she is there?

Because she's not a child. The Canadian government has an AVOID ALL TRAVEL advisory for Palestine. At some point you need to have some personal responsibility. Canada will work to get people like her out, but there are limits to what can be done."

Considering half the population is unemployed and the entire population is living in extreme poverty with absolutely no freedom of movement.  And the Israeli government made it clear that will never change.  So no hope other than so sit and wait for death.

She has also been interviewed from Gaza in 2021, saying how unsafe it was, but still chose to keep living there

This person obviously sees herself as Palestinian first and chose to raise her family in an ""open air prison"". Why should Canada have any responsibility towards someone like that? Her kids have never lived in Canada."
"> Canada has the same obligation to all it's citizens, which shouldn't be controversial

Like everything related to government, there needs to be a ""within reason"" clause. Canada can organize an evacuation of Israeli Citizens because there's infrastructure to allow for it. In Gaza there isn't. 

Most importantly, Canada has a AVOID ALL TRAVEL restriction placed onto Gaza, basically warning citizens ahead of time to not go there, if something happens the government cannot help you. While the government should be involved in getting citizens out of sudden wars, there comes a point where the situation a citizen finds himself in is so ridiculous, that its simply on them. To take another example, if some Canadian Citizen like an idiot decided to cross into North Korea, and then gets arrested by the army and thrown in prison, does the government have a responsibility to bail him out and extradite him? I think not. Same principal applies to Gaza. The government is quite clear that if something goes wrong whilst you're in Gaza, you're almost certainly out of help's reach, and if you still choose to go there, you do so at your own risk. This isn't a case where the government ""all of a sudden"" is making biased decisions about who to help, and that they're betraying Canadians living in Gaza."
So you think Canada can force Israel to negotiate hahaha
"No but all members of Hamas certainly are, unless you’re on Reddit or in a Canadian academic institution apparently."
"So they belong with the white supremesits for having one potential shared opinion, but pro hamas protestors supporting terrorists can’t have the same logic applied to them.

Interesting."
">Most of their casualties are civilians, not military.

Gee, I wonder *why* that is?

Could it be that The Palestinian State/PLO/Hamas *are not allowed a professional standing army*?

>It just doesn't make the news in the west for.. reasons.

Correct! And they're the reasons I just pointed out; not some vast conspiracy theory akin to space lasers."

"Israel isn't really trying to kill civilians though. Not as a goal. Hamas sets up rocket launchers and such and warns if they're going to strike, but sometimes their civilians aren't really trying to get out of the way. Sometimes I think some of them want to die. 

This would likely stop if Hamas laid down their arms and stopped targeting civilians and said ""yes, Jews can live in the Levant"". But Hamas just wants to kill all the Jews. Israel can't just lay down arms.

Israelis meanwhile, desperately gets out of the way of any missle attack.

Hamas could end this now, if they really wanted."

"Yeah. The IDF response to the attack is a self described seige (meaning they are not hiding it at all) of gaza. They are completely cutting off water, food and electricity from the area. That's a war crime. War crimes are not a tit for tat thing. It's a war crime no matter what side does it."

This attack justifies a final blow to Gaza after a slow burn of land theft and genocide. I can’t stand how propaganda has shifted the discourse on this into absurdity."
"Apparently many of the men who committed the mass rape, child murder and kidnapping in the attacks were part of the work groups Israel recently allowed to leave Gaza. The reason why Egypt and Jordan don't want them is because historically when they've allowed Palestinians into their countries they start terrorism campaigns domestically. Look at the ones Canada has allowed in, celebrating on our streets about the barbarism their compatriots unleashed specifically against unarmed people."
Are Jewish people controlling Muslim countries borders as well now?
*4200 Canadians.
Yeah this is totally the same as an expat living in Singapore or California.
"Sorry comrade, I guess I'm not anti-national enough for you"
"So no source. 

Ok then."
They also have a do not travel advisory for Israel yet they evacuated all the Israeli Canadians and pour their hearts out for them in the media. Have yet to hear any government spokesperson speak out against Israel for bombing the humanitarian corridor to Egypt.
Who says she's in Hamas? Or her kids?
What do civilians have to do with all of this? They didn't fuck around did they. Some people are so bloody callous.
"Wow, what an original thought."
"My question is how those ideologies came into existence. Why does Canada not have terrorists to the same extent as Gaza? Simply saying all Palestinians are terrorists takes any nuance out of the equation. There are only two ways out of the situation in Israel, genocide of all Palestinians or equal rights for everyone. If you have any better ideas please elaborate. 

Also no shit I don’t support terrorism that’s an extreme accusation how about you actually address what I’m saying?"
You guys always seem to conveniently leave out an important factor…

"In the full length interview she mentions how her parents’ house is in Gaza. Sounds like she’s from Palestine, as in she moved *back* to Gaza in 2014 where *her parents have a house.* 

Ginella also asks “what do you want people to know is happening in your *hometown*”"
"https://x.com/itsginellamassa/status/1393386956189585408?s=20

This interview from 2021 says she moved BACK to Gaza in 2014 from Canada. She’s originally from Gaza maybe?"
"Show me a single instance of Canada applying public pressure to Israel to allow a humanitarian corridor out of Gaza. Instead Israel bombs it. Egypt protests the bombings, but at no point does Canada apply ANY public pressure to back up this initiative. It's sad and a truely mask off moment."
All of Israel is on a do not travel advisory. Seems like we're quite choosey with who we decide to support.
Neither are the Israeli Canadians who already were evacuated by Canada with outmost urgency and shown an outpouring of support in the government and media. Weird.
Apply public pressure to Israel to open the humanitarian corridor rather than bombing it like they've been doing. The lack of any condemnation on this horrendous act speaks volumes.
Never mind self imposed danger
They could at least apply public pressure for Israel to stop bombing the humanitarian corridor. But no they don't even do that.
"> Israel is a first world democracy, Gaza is controlled by a recognized terrorist group. It doesn't take a genius to understand why it would be easier for Canada to retrieve dual nationals from one over the other. And you would know that going to live there.

NONE of the First world democracy's that i know of have been declared an Apartheid Government by human rights organizations like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the UN and also their Own Former Mossad chief: 
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/6/former-mossad-chief-israel-enforcing-apartheid-system-against-palestinians

where are you getting that Israel is a first world democracy??  because the world disagrees with that sentiment."
You're saying citizens aren't granted rights if they are not located in Canada currently? Better tell the Canadian government as they've evacuated the Israeli Canadians already and poured their support for them in the media. Interesting.
They evacuated all the Israeli Canadians already. Tons of interviews highlighting their suffering and anguish as well. You could call it disproportionate.
They contacted her by email but no phone calls or follow up or action publicly at least to pressure Israel to open the humanitarian corridor that they are currently bombing.
No shit Sherlock. If you are saving one citizen you should save another who's right there
">honestly I'm a dual citizen and I'm pretty sure it depends on which passport you're traveling on

Technically it doesn't. It depends on what the country you are in does. Eg. China doesn't recognize dual citizenship, so you are always Chinese to them."
"So if Canada was able to help her you’d prefer to have her and her family be left there in danger? Why?

Is cruelty the point?"
Pressure. It requires cooperation from the US. Considering that Israel is commiting genocide you'd think self proclaimed moral stalwarts like Canada would at least try. But Israel as usual gets a free pass. Not a peep from the US and Canada on Israel's blockade of food and water to the region and numerous bombings of the humanitarian corridor to Egypt. Shows you who truly calls the shots here.
"Okay then so we're agreed. Many in this thread seem to be blaming this woman for existing in her homeland, probably because of family. Hamas she is not."

"Uhh Hamas is evil too. The idf is just the lesser known evil. Sorry I'm not playing into your little ""you're either with us or against us"" game. Currently they are by far the most genocidal regime considering they are bombing humanitarian corridors and trying to starve millions of civilians, mostly children. Truly ironic."
"Nobody here is calling Hamas heroes, wtf are you talking about?"
"Yeah, and those people are fucking disgusting.  Two groups of people that do heinous shit can be fucking disgusting.  Both group are terrorists is my point."
"Yeah the numbers have been posted all over this subreddit, the ""My Feelings don't care about facts"" crowd won't give a shit.  

A quarter of all the deaths this year are women and children, and more than 80% of deaths was from live ammunition.  So they literally shot women and children."
They'll just call it Russian misinformation and keep spewing lies
That is a UN page and Israel is literally a filter on the chart. What do you think the [OCHA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_for_the_Coordination_of_Humanitarian_Affairs) is? Lmfao
"Israel is not responsible for taking care of Palestine. There is a whole side with Egypt… why doesn’t Egypt help? Look into that btw. 

You need to get educated my friend."
This to me shows that Hamas doesn’t give a shit about the people they’re claiming to “defend”. What idiots attack a country that can shut off their water and electricity? An agency extremely tactical in creating chaos and pointing blame.
This is basically 9/11: Part 2.
You don’t know what you’re talking about. Israel is under no obligation to provide utilities to an enemy nation that just attacked it.
Ok Liberal
"If one calls people animals, accuse them of underdeveloped intelligence - eventually, one starts believing in their own lies and gets caught odd guard. That's on Netanyahu's arrogance. He moved most of the military resources towards West Bank to protect the settlements - that's one of the reasons why it took so long for the military to reach the South."
Are you saying the attack by Hamas was justified and merits no response? Just curious
[deleted]
Lol this seems terribly misguided
"The more you say ""barbarism"", ""celebrating on our streets"" ""ones Canada has allowed in"", the less I'm willing to listen to your argument. I'm also an immigrant, I have friends who are Muslim immigrants, I guess we're all barbarians ""celebrating on your streets"" and ""ones you've allowed in"".

Like you're basically telling on yourself at this point. Making these kind of generalizations and saying these things about people you don't know, labeling them as rapists without any real evidence. You're just a bigoted racist."
"You do realize that the Gaza Strip has been blockaded since 2007, right? If you're implying something about Egypt, I don't think that should be part of the conversation because Egypt hasn't been conducting airstrikes and atrocities against the Palestinians."
"There’s a source - there’s many sources of this person in media interviews, try Google instead of asking others to do your work.

 You have to request permission to follow Ginnellas account now to see her Twitter to see the interview with Asia.  She refers to Gaza as her hometown in the interview. 

She’s decided to go back to Gaza in 2014, did another interview in 2021 about air raids and still decided to stay with children? When she has Canadian citizenship? Totally irresponsible but I guess she’s probably living for free in one of the buildings her family owns"
"Actually no, the travel advisory for Israel is AVOID ALL NON-ESSENTIAL TRAVEL, not AVOID ALL TRAVEL. it's very easy to get people out of Israel, you just send planes to big airports and voilà. 

You are obviously quite biased on this issue and think Canada is not helping these people on purpose, but it's just way more difficult."
"Its very easy to get people out of Israel, its a big country with flights departing regularly from multiple airports.   


Its very hard to get someone out of Gaza, it's a small strip surrounded by a wall with heavily regulated entry and exit, that's currently being carpet bombed. Every time there's a major conflict in the middle east we hear about having to evacuate Canadians who haven't lived in Canada in over a decade, like why are they asking Canada for help and not Palestine?"
"Well the government of Israel cooperates. Hamas, meanwhile, is telling its citizens not to evacuate the area that Israel has warned it will bomb, because Hamas does not even pretend to give a flying fuck about the civilian population and seems to want to martyr as many of them as possible. Given this context it becomes obvious why Canada has been able to evacuate citizens from Israel but not Gaza."
They elected them with a majority of votes when their platform openly called for the eradication of Isreal and the people living there. For starters.
"Tell that to Hamas. They did this with full awareness of how severe the response would be, with a guy like Netanyahu as PM of Israel. They threw Gaza under the bus."
"The burnt Israeli babies also did nothing, but the Palestine government decided to go after civilians and babies. Would you not expect a huge response to that?"
"Hamas has a long history of using civilians (Palestinian & Israeli) as human shields.

Edit: Two wrongs don't make a right, but this time around it doesn't look like the Israelis care if some Palestinian civilians are killed in the crossfire."
"Look at what Palestinians have done or tried to do in Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan, etc... and why these countries will never take more in, or in the case of Lebanon, are not happy with what's currently happening. 

Now what do you think they'll do to jews? Take it easy and be cool chilling with the West Bank/Gaza and full autonomy? This obviously isn't all Palestinians or maybe not a majority but it's a significant amount."
You always seem to explain away acts of terror. Why?
"The standard is different once you give an interview asking your government to come and get you from *your home in Gaza*. Someone raised the issue of why people would live in Israel on a kibbutz. I wouldn't choose that personally, but then again I've set down deep roots in my province, our country, so different mindset. But still if you're asking me if it would be safer or better living part time in rural Israel or Gaza, with no cultural, religious or ethnic connection to either place, it would take me a millisecond to choose against Gaza, because of what Palestinians say about Gaza. I just found it odd that a Canadian citizen would live there and be the subject of insecurity and by accounts oppression, when they have a country *here*."
"Loads of families that immigrated keep homes where they came from or inherit homes from grandparents that pass away.

Maybe CTV got it wrong in saying she's originally from Toronto and calling here ""a Toronto woman"", but even her accent certainly doesn't sound like she just arrived for the minimum number of years and then bolted with a passport.

Either way, the poster I disagree with has no definitive info on her background and is making derogatory assumptions about a woman whose life they don't know much about."
"She is actually from Gaza according to the full length interview with Ginella Massa.

But I guess the CBC is fudging the truth to deny that this Palestinian-Canadian whose parents live in Gaza is actually a Torontonian."
"I understood that Egoyt closed their border, I'm not sure if Canada would be able to pressure them to reopen it. I could be wrong. ( things are changing so fast)

It is *now* after the terrorist attacks. It wasn't previously.
Imagine being a dual citizen and choosing to live where we have travel advisories in place for obvious reasons.
"Lets step back for a sec. How does Canada get Canadians out of Gaza ?

We have no consulate or offices there, because it is run by a recognized terrorist group. Hamas isn’t welcoming Canadian diplomats nor do we want to engage with terrorists, let alone coordinate a dangerous evacuation

Compare this to Israel who is working with us to evacuate Canadians

One of these is much more feasible than the other, whatever your beliefs on the subject.

Yes, we can try and should coordinate with our partners to open up diplomatic corridors, but none of that can be done without the partnership of Hamas. And it can’t be done in a matter of days, at least without a much, much, much higher risk of something going wrong. 

This is why it is much faster and easier for us to get out Canadians in Israel. And by the way, there are about 25x the number of Canadians in Israel as Gaza, and we have last I checked only got one plane of <150 individuals out of Israel as I am writing this."
But it's Israel. They matter more apparently.
I think that would have been an easier problem to deal with though. I can only assume a plan to get people out of Gaza if going to take longer.
"Let’s park the labels you have for Israel for a sec. How does Canada get Canadians out of Gaza ?

"Honestly, I'm sure they'd be getting her out of Gaza if they could. Getting people out of Israel is just orders of magnitude easier currently."
"Why should I, as tax payer, be on the hook to fix somebody's stupid decisions? Especially if those have a citizenship of the country they are living in?"

What part of its a war crime don't you understand.
"This may come as surprising to you, but there is no need to shut off their water and electricity.

Or bomb hospitals.

Or kill innocent civilians, including children.

Or even engage Gaza in any conflict, whatsoever."
"A seige means nothing is getting in. They are not allowing ANYONE to provide food, water and electricity. That's a war crime so STFU."
Collective punishment is a war crime
Trudeau expressed that Israel is able to defend itself as long as it followed international law.  It's already broken those by the bombing and the successive siege.
"Identity politics propaganda from the story telling boy who cried wolf.

Shouldn't you be marching with Islamic extremists against SOGI like the rest of the Far Right. Lol"
What? They said the government was warned. How did you get “the Hamas attack was justified” from that? Reading comprehension fail.
...and yet how many of them openly oppose Hamas?
You mean the ones cheering on the streets of Montreal and Paris and New York about the mass savagery of their countrymen? Laughing a grieving families? Calling for a global pogrom tomorrow?
Are you denying the hamas terrorists raped innocent women in their attack this week?
"Got it. ""People are saying"" and ""Google it.""

LMAOOOO. Good god you guys are hilarious. That's some serious MAGA talk."
Why have we not seen any public pressure from Canada in Israel's genocidal blockade of food and water to Gaza knowing they have citizens stuck there? Why have they not spoken out about their repeated bombings of the humanitarian corridor? Hmm? Come on now. This will be a good one from a non biased man like yourself.
Addressed this already. Doesn't take a lot of effort to at least apply pressure to Israel to open a humanitarian corridor rather than bombing it.
Are you saying Israel gives a dam  about civilians when they are starving them en masse by blocking food and water from entering? Or is it when they bomb the humanitarian corridors that Egypt keeps asking them to stop bombing? Is there the cooperation and care for civilians you are referring to?
"In 2006, with 44% support. Not a majority. 65% of the population is under the age of 24 and wouldn't have ever voted. 

Hamas isn't the Palestinian people. Jfc."
"Why didn't Israel stop it though? They had the intelligence from Egypt that an attack was imminent. 

Maybe Israel shouldn't have helped Hamas form in the first place. 

https://theintercept.com/2018/02/19/hamas-israel-palestine-conflict/"
"But we’re talking about this lady and her kids?

>Tell that to Hamas.

It should be obvious by now that Hamas doesn’t care at all.  They are not even encouraging evacuation to safer areas, just the opposite."
Israel is justified in killing thousands of civilians including children because Hamas are barbaric savages who do the same! Wait.. what? Funny thing is one is a recognized terrorist group and the other is a western supported democracy. That's actually more damning IMO.
"Palestinian civilians, who are largely under the age of 20, had nothing to do with the Hamas attack."
There is no Palestine government the people elected a terrorist organization that has no interest in ever bettering anything but their position of hate and murder of Jews everywhere . The couldn’t care shit about their people or others .
"Yeah well, the IDF uses Palestinians as human shields too. 

The IDF also, as we are witnessing currently, collectively punishes the Palestinians. Israel is not a victim, it never has been."
"You say you understand it isn’t all Palestinians but also aren’t advocating for anything which helps them either. All Jews being in danger is a hypothetical Palestinians being oppressed is what is happening currently and for decades at this point.

The status quo means more Israeli, and Palestinian deaths why not try to fix that because correct me if I’m wrong you’re not saying something should be changed. This cycle of violence will continue until the Palestinians are all wiped out. Israel is backed by the entire west with one of the most powerful militaries in the world. I’m also certain that if they did get attacked by the surrounding countries (which they wouldn’t because the US has influence there, as well as the fact Israel defended itself once already when all those countries attacked when it was far weaker) they would get even more support from the west just like Ukraine. 

I’ll try to summarize Israel needs to give Palestinians equal rights that’s the only peaceful way out of this. Reparations will be needed as well. Israel will have a hard time but that isn’t an excuse for what they’re doing to Palestinians right now. Slave owners were afraid of freeing slaves because of what comes next, I’m going to assume you’re a good person and that you don’t advocate for slavery. The only other way out of this is ethnic cleansing in some shape or form. Which is slowly killing them all or kicking them out. Please let me know if you need clarification or if you disagree."
You mean providing context for the situation that people like yourself willfully ignore? Why do you so desperately want to hide the truth?
"Ok well if we're making assumptions about these people, why not assume that the reason they're in Gaza is to care for their elderly parents who are unable to come to Canada? That's a similar situation as many of the Canadians in Israel and seems reasonable to me. I know several people who have moved their families to their parent's country for that kind of reason.

I’m going to go out on a limb here and say that elder care is unlikely to be high quality in Palestine."
"🚜-🥅

Take the L bud"
"Egypt WANTS to open it for humanitarian reasons. That's not the same as saying they want to flood Egypt with refugees, but the corridor was meant for aid and letting out small groups. Israel has repeatedly bombed it despite Egypt asking them to stop.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/egypt-urges-israel-to-stop-bombing-rafah-crossing-to-allow-aid-delivery/

https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-said-to-bomb-rafah-crossing-to-egypt-after-telling-gazans-to-flee-through-it/

The Rafah crossing was open for periods Tuesday morning, but Egypt only allowed through Palestinians who’d already gotten authorization to leave the Strip.

So this spot would be the key to let foreign nationals escape and be evacuated. But Israel refuses and keeps bombing it over and over. Apparently they said they were bombing tunnel. It's unknown why this tunnel keeps needing to be bombed over and over again. Almost like they want to seal it off."
"Why wasn't it lol? My whole life I've heard randomly Arabs are attacking Israel. First it was the Arab States then it was these little rebel groups. 

Knowing that why would you go travel there knowing it could be attacked at any minute."
What does that have to do with my point? All of Israel is on a do not travel advisory.
Already addressed this. At least publically apply pressure to Israel to open a humanitarian corridor rather than bombing it.

"Not voluntarily supplying free energy to a nation that just attacked you is not specifically a war crime afaik. Other things, like indiscriminate bombing of civilian buildings, would be."
They can go Egypt way. You wouldn’t let the enemy out in a siege unless they surrendered. And again you have no understanding of what legally is a war crime so I won’t shut up. You are pushing Hamas propaganda and feeding terrorist bs on here. You should maybe stay quiet and read a little history/law before yelling here. Not that I’d expect you to be capable of it…
Jesus man…. You have a lot to learn. Imagine defending terrorists.
"Haha you are truly clueless if you think what they are doing are against the laws of war. This by the way is not up for your interpretation, it’s what’s internationally agreed upon. Basically civilian casualties are acceptable if the intended target can reasonably be suspected to be military. Since Hamas shoots rockets from civilian buildings they validate Israel bombing them. To go even further, Israel doesn’t even have to prove that there was a Hamas militant there, they just have to reasonably suspect it. Yeah I agree that this does sound fd up but this was agreed upon by all countries. So as you can see Hamas essentially sets Israel up to be able to do this by using the civilian buildings to lunch rockets from, dig tunnels under etc. Now they are crying foul but they could just operate like a regular military and not hide amongst the people. Of course they would get bombed to oblivion in no time with that tactic. So you get what you get."
"Are you op? 


It sounded like op was implying nets office was warned, and it was ignored to justify crushing Hamas. And it’s now an absurd result of propaganda that people now support retaliation by Israel… 


How did you interpret op?…"
"Interesting. Where are the anti-Hamas rallies by Palestinians? This is like the nonsense argument that 'ordinary russians oppose the genocide in Ukraine', No they don't.

"74 of 132 seats, which is a majority.

Designated a terrorist group by many countries.

Rejected a two-state solution in favour of conflict with Israel, in which they intentionally use human shields for their military.

That's what citizens voted for.

Does it mean that Isreal has a right to randomly kill civilians? No. But it is a war, and Hamas, the elected government of Palestine, uses human shields. That will result in people dying.

I have sympathy for the plight of Palestinians. They/Hamas has proven to be happy to use illegal means of warfare. As a result, Isreal can't just let citizens come into their country to flee conflict for fear of the refugees being infiltrated by terrorists, resulting in more dead babies. Hamas has done this to Gazans. They knew how Israel would retaliate. If you want to be upset with someone, that's who you should be upset with. Israel's responsibility is first and foremost to keep its citizens safe, and that is what it is doing."

"They were offered most of modern Palestine several times after the 70's and rejected them. The hardliners came in after in Israel as a result of increasing violence. If Palestine was as powerful or lucky to have an ally like the US, Israel would be wiped out. As it stands, this isn't the case in the reverse. Israel has done terrible things, but far more Israelis are willing to live with Palestinians than the reverse. 

The whole region is far more complicated than you suggest and you ignore all the shit I talked about between Palestinians and other Islam countries. Again, they were offered control of the vast majority of the West Bank and all of Gaza. Several times. They refused. The latest was in 2008, and they refused because they wouldn't get part of Jerusalem as it's capital. Israel even offered the rest of the West Bank that they would keep as land adjacent to Gaza. We're talking about 93% control of the West Bank plus another 5% in extra land around Gaza.

Tell me, do you think they'd get further taking the vast majority of what they wanted and as a recognized state, work towards that part of Jerusalem? Or, the trajectory they followed the 15 following years?

It seems you're arguing from some generic colonization playbook and don't have much of an idea of what's happening over there."
Does context change the fact the state carried out terrorist acts ?
"That guy already took the L when their original comment was removed, for clearly being bigoted and offensive.

Maybe you missed that context, but it's not really what anyone should be standing up for."
"Sorry, in your original  post, you stated, "" was allowing a corridor OUT of Egypt. 

As for the bombing at the border, it was stated on another Reddit thread that were Hamas tunnels there. I could not locate any news report to substantiate this, so, fyi. 

Also of interest.

I’m confused by this because Egypt also apparently refused to allow Palestinians in when Biden asked them to.
"On the slim chance that you're arguing in good faith... Palestine / the Gaza strip has been on Canada's  ""do not travel"" / ""avoid all travel"" advisory list since at least 2014.

Conversely, Israel has been under several ""excersie caution"" advisories in that period. I did not see any previous ""do not travel"" or ""avoid all travel"" advisories to Israel for Canadians.

Canada usually (possibly always, I can't find an official policy) assists its citizens to leave a region which is placed under a NEW do not travel advisory. I've not seen an instance of the government assisting people who traveled into zones that were already on thr advisory list.


EDIT:

thread is locked, but I dislike being called a liar. So to refute the claim in the comment below about Sudan. 

*If anything that link supports my argument, not yours. On April 16, 2023 the travel advisories to Sudan changed from ""avoid non essential travel"" to ""do not travel"".*

*Over the next four months the Canadian government worked to contact every single Canadian working in the country and provide them with information and options to evacuate.*

*Prior to April 16, Canada was actively participating in diplomatic activities and aid operations. Thousands of Canadians were in Sudan on government sanctioned business. Following the change in thr situation on the ground, the government worked to evacuate Canadian citizens.*

https://web.archive.org/web/20230101000000*/https://travel.gc.ca/destinations/sudan

*The situation in Sudan is akin to the situation in Israel. Citizens were free to travel there. Then a war broke out. Then Canada told citizens not to travel there. Then Canada began working to evacuate citizens.*

*Conversely, neither the situation in Sudan or Israel compares to Gaza, where citizens have been told for a decade not to travel there, to leave immediately, and warned that Canada has limited ability to aid them in that region. Essentially ""travel at your own risk"".*"
"Of course it was. The guy is siding against Netanyahu in Israeli politics so he throwing dirt on his policies. Not saying he is wrong but it’s practically the same banter as PP criticizing Trudeau or vice versa. Also he is talking about the West Bank, which is the Fatah lead area completely removed from Gaza. Mixing the 2 is not sensible because the 2 places separate governments."
"Continuing to call Canada a genocidal state is to call Germany a Nazi state. We have changed, we have admitted that it happened, but it is now not happening. Calling Canada anything now that we progressed past our past in so many ways is to ignore any of the progress that has been made."
"Russia, Gaza and North Korea are dictatorships.  
Israel is not.   
You can demand your rights in Israel.  
You cannot do the same in the other three without ending up dead."
Not weird. Israel is easy to coordinate with by comparisson.
The person in the article is Palestinian in Palestine.
"These numbers mean nothing without context and you know it. Palestinians have been trying to eradicate jews since they arrived in 1947/48. 

Unfortunately for Palestinians, they are not very good a fighting wars and alongside several surrounding countries lost many times until they ultimately got relegated to gaza and west bank. 

Despite this, Palestinians still decided to continue their lust for blood and voted Hamas in the 2000s. 

They are constantly the aggressors and Israel needs to respond and eliminate their cells because if Israel does not… they will continue stuff like they did this past week. At least 40 ish percent of Palestinians voted Hamas in (which is high if you understand how voting works). Of course, it is sad when innocent civilians are killed through collateral damage but Hamas loves using human shields so here we are. 

I could go on but you seem set on defending terrorists. 

F in the chat for you misguided nonsense."
Your an idiot. Egypt is not letting Palestians cross the border. They are trapped. This isn't proganda.. These are facts. Both sides in this conflict are horrible.
Hamas propaganda lol
"I'm not defending hamas at all, but you are absolutely turning a blind eye to war crimes."
"Since you’re all over this thread blatantly baring your bias, I’ll continue to post the numbers that made you delete a very stupid comment.

https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties#

•	⁠since 2008 it's been 6407 Palestinian deaths and 308 Israeli deaths

•	⁠since 2008 it's been 3803 Palestinian civilian deaths and 177 Israeli civilian deaths

•	⁠since 2008 it's been 901 Palestinian children deaths and 25 Israeli children deaths"

"That's the thing; there are no anti-Hamas rallies.  Even if you were to assume that there are people who are in Gaza who oppose them but are afraid to publicly, that doesn't excuse the people who are in safer western countries but do nothing."
"Already noted this is incorrect. Egypt was using the crossing for aid and letting small groups leave but then Israel kept bombing it and threatened to bomb aid coming in as well.

"Yet Canada is plenty loud when it comes to India, China, SA, etc. Israel? Off limits!"
Lmao this kind of stuff should be PUBLIC pressure considering the humanitarian consequences. But oh wells you say. Who knows? I wonder whyyy
"Let's break this down: 

44% of the population voted for them. 17 years ago! That's not a majority of the people of Gaza is it?

Further, as I already stated, the majorty of Gazans, 65%, are under the age of 24 and wouldn't have voted. 

If a majority of Gazans, 50%+, had voted for Hamas in the last few years, you may have an argument."

Israel told them to escape through the Egyptian crossing and then bombed it.
You know that rheroric is getting real tired as Israel repeatedly bombs the humanitarian corridor. The first time they said they were targetting tunnels nearby. Then they did it again and again. Then you see entire square kilometerz of Gaza blown up by IDF bombs. All Hamas targets and tunnels everywhere I guess. Makes you wonder.
You’re still using hypotheticals which aren’t based in reality all off of fear that what Israel has been doing will be done back to them. Completely ignoring the thousands of lives that are being lost right now. I’m telling you what’s happening right now and one way out of it and you’re responding with fears which justify the status quo. I personally believe that’s incredibly immoral and some part of you has to realize what you’re saying will lead to more deaths. You can’t bomb and oppress people out of their extremist beliefs that’s very ahistorical.
"No, but it does explain how Israel and Palestine became bitter enemies. Which is helpful when discussing the matter…if you’re not planning on being disingenuous, that is."
"If they were bombing it due to tunnels why do they do it repeatedly over days? Almost seems like they are lying doesn't it. I said this already and you bring it up again despite it being nonsensical given Israel keeps bombing the same crossing. My article shows Egypt was letting small groups of Palestinians OUT through the corridor when it wasn't getting bombed.

They are also threatening to bomb humanitarian aid OUT of Egypt into Gaza. Just Israel things..."
" A quick google showed that's a lie. Middle of the article they were looking to evacuate Canadian stuck on Sudan

"> Not saying he is wrong 

agreed, but it still doesn't change the fact the multiple human protection agencies have also called their treatment of the Palestinians Apartheid."
"I don't believe anyone or any entity is calling Canada a genocidal state..  

In the past yes but it is very much a different country now."
"Palestine isn’t a country according to Canada, so she has no such citizenship."
Man it’s really interesting watching someone bend themselves in half to justify killing children and apartheid. I have yet to see someone say what happened in Israel was ok. I sure have seen a lot of pro-Israel comments about how it’s ok to subjugate non combatants for decades!
"You need to go all the way back to 1948 to compare numbers against 2008...that tells me all I need to know.

> it is sad when innocent civilians are killed through collateral damage but Hamas loves using human shields so here we are.

Are you listening to yourself LMAO

""Hamas loves using human shields so Israel has _absolutely no choice_ but to shoot and kill all the Palestinians they can, and starve the rest of them to death! It's all Hamas' fault!""

Hamas is bad but your post is like watching Putin justify why he needed to invade Ukraine, it makes absolutely 0 sense if you aren't brainwashed"
Yes war is horrible. Wish the elected government of Gaza - Hamas would have invested in its citizens instead of starting one.
It sounds like Hamas is badly losing this conflict and should probably stop doing war crimes so their people can just live in peace.
