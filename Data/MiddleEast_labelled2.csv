 I agree with you about the war any nation would go to war after an incursion that slaughter over a thousand civilian any nation would be prosecute an urban war in much the same way I do nt know how many civilian casualty would result in someone else like canada or the netherlands be in charge of prosecute the war but I do nt think that the delta be as large as most people seem to believe at the bare minimum it seem like israel be adhere to the rule of war and be not commit anything that could accurately be describe as a genocide but I m also worried that the conflict will result in permanent displacement that the israeli right will use as an excuse for more ethnic cleansing of area 

 the war in gaza be a state take action after action by a terrorist group make the status quo unacceptable to the israeli public the ethnic cleansing on the west bank be revanchism that be completely unjustifiable",-1.0,1

 in comparison all of palestine east jerusalem west bank gaza from 1994 to 2020 combine for 41 billion in total aid from all country include we and gaza due to the nature of hamas relationship with israel and usa do not receive the sizeable chunk you think it do most of it go to the palestinian authority in the west bank which itself be be colonize by israel even as we speak the result then be money from the west bank actually funnel back into the israeli economy 

 of course there be legitimate question as to how the money be handle by the palestinian authority whatever the amount may be but there be no doubt that israel occupy more and more land in the west bank and blockade gaza while also maintain an absurd amount of control over the life of the palestinians be not do anything good for the cause of peace it be do the exact opposite and this be disappointing but it be not surprising israel be execute its plan to control all of the holy land and so long as the world will continue to be blind of this it will work

"i d disagree with you kind of I think the idea you be propose be correct what I disagree with you on be the scope and label 

 I do nt think this be just a middle east thing I think its a global war between the idea of democracy and authoritarianism we have country in south america north america europe africa and asia all embattle between group advocate for democracy and one for authoritarianism 

 the february 2022 escalation of the ukraine war be I think emblematic of this and here be just another way its be play out democratic israel vs the authoritarian hamas government you can theoretically have a democratic jihadist government hamas be not 

 personally I think an extremely concern portion of the democratic population have be grow in their belief that authoritarianism be the answer to their problem as it be an easy solution to what problem every problem people want to feel morally justified and authoritarianism be exponentially well at make moral superiority clear and simple democracy require nuance understand learning and discovery to come to conclusion about whether something be morally good or bad or where on the morality spectrum it land authoritarian just tell you its morally superior or if its anyone outside the regime morally corrupt and that s it 

 its the only way I can think of that explain syria and western response towards the civil war there authoritarian dictator massacre civilian to retain power and fight off democratic revolutionary just ignore it because its easy that way democratic israel in an incredibly complex situation where answer for their action take time and think to understand just go with what the authoritarian say its easy to find moral justification in their answer than it be to engage mentally with morality around israeli action and answer",0.0,0

 to far drive this home why would gaza be the sole focus of israeli aggression egypt jordan lebanon and germany have all have conflict with jews and israelis yet all of they now be in peaceful relation as far as israel be concern 

 israel and germany now maintain a special relationship base on share belief western value and a combination of historical perspective among the most important factor in their relation be nazi germanys genocide of jews in europe during the holocaust 

 if israel can work together with a nation that once try to genocide the jewish population then they be definitely willing to do the same with other it need to be an effort on both side and unfortunately until hamas be remove that can never happen 

 israel and saudi arabia be about to make a trade agreement that would far legitimize israel as a nation among arab muslim nation which be in direct conflict with the idea that israel be incapable of work with other nation to reach peaceful resolution after they have be victim of conflict
