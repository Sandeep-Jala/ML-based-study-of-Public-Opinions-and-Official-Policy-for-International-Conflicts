 to people like her everything be justify because israel be a settlercolonial state that need to be decolonize I guess its a good thing she s in a country that be nt consider by a grow number of people to be one of these socalled settlercolonial state oh wait 



 these event serve as a reminder that resistance against colonial violence be justify and necessary this be decolonization and landback actualize as we continue to see the palestinian people stand firm in their resistance against their oppressor 

 settlercolonial state like socalle canada and their institution continue to legitimize their existence and those of other settlercolonial state make they complicit in the ongoing genocide

funny how they never protest against apartheid and 50 year of occupation,1,1
funny how people equate hama with civilian palestinians who have nothing to do with any of this,1,-1
what would the point be even if they somehow manage to replace hamas gaza would still be under a blockade and palestine would still be subject to occupation,1,1
funny how you never march either,0,1
"end the cycle of violence now that all the jew kill we can get away with for the time be be complete 

 friendly reminder that the number of palestinians kill by idf strike on gaza this week if somehow hama have be able to avoid slaughter over twelve hundred innocent man woman and child would have be zero 

 we be now see credible report that hamas be prevent palestinian civilian from go to south gaza as always because they wish to maximize civilian casualty for propaganda purpose",1,1
funny how they never protest against the mass starvation of palestinian civilian,1,1
"I would love to see you apply the same logic to israel  
 
  even when idf be snipe unarmed child and be proud about it even brag about their precision and how they know where every bullet go motherfucker like you would immediately scream condemn hamas to anyone talk about it   lookup the march of return of 2018 for a great example of unarmed child pregnant woman journalist and medic getting snipe even during those event the first thing every brown people get ask when they be interview about it be do you condemn hamas action no one ever ask the israel side if they condemn the snipping of unarmed child",1,-1
"because hamas have nt drop 6000 bomb include illegal phosphorous bomb on a civilian population with water and electricity cut off 

 and to make it totally clear because people like you like to push a red heron narrative the protest be in support of palestinians go through a genocide at the hand of israel not for hama",1,1

"I can almost guarantee that the rally themselves be not pro terrorism and the media be just on its typical outrage cycle if there be people out there actually chant in support of terrorism or be antisemitic you know they d have the video everywhere 

 I say this in part because year ago I pop by a palestine rally I live in ottawa and walk by a lot of protest I walk through the convoy too to see what be up even though I disagree and there be a bunch of orthodox jewish people the speaker call jewish people their brother and sister and say that israelis be not the enemy and that be as bomb fall on gaza so I do nt see what would be different now other than the clickbait outrage stuff be even more of an issue in the medium 

 it go both way too I never meet an israeli in real life who would nt be shock and sicken by some of the thing their self appoint ally say in support you think the average israeli be go to feel good see random canadian say that their government should kill 3 million people indiscriminately these be all people most of they probably do nt like violence or war as much as the media want this conflict to define both side act like israelis support the action of the idf uncritically and act like all gazan support hama kill civilian be armchair af and its interesting that a lot of people do both",1,0
palestinian rally hold here be almost never pro hamas I m not say they ca nt happen but I have never personally see it they be usually in solidarity for the people of palestine ask for an end to israeli hostility and occupation protestor just want the same freedom and right for palestinians as israel have,1,0
