Those who support Palestine didn't even condemn Hamas. Tell me what was the point of gathering together for Palestine support on the same day the Israelis were massacred. It was rather a support for Hamas than Palestine. You can't justify the massacre of 1200 innocents by giving us the context of history.
"Indians support because they supported us in need i.e Kargil war. The whole world support is sham. In recent years a lot of islamists joined the ranks of think tanks and media orgs, now they project whatever the fuck they want."
"Israel out of all odds survived and saved their space they deserved while surrounded with deadly religious neighbors. 

I like their guts. 

Their attitude of no backing down no matter how hard they were thrown into a corner.

India is in same place with neighbors ready to attack and occupy India or destroy India."
Israel coz wonder woman.
"I used to support Palestine, but not any more. That doesn't mean that I support Israel either. While I vehemently hate Iran for starting this thing, but I think the reason behind Iran starting this is the internal unrest it faces today. To distract people, it financed a war. The US and the West on the other hand used the war as a military expo, demonstarting arms for potential sellers. It is a demostration of live arms."
"""The whole world"" has not chosen Palestine, The US, UK, Germany, France and so many more nations are vehemently pro-israel. Why are dumbassess like you allowed to speak on issues omg."
"Isreal sucks for what they've been doing to palestine. Hamas suck for what they recently did. 

To oversimplify it, it's an ESH situation where neither side is good. 

I'm on the side of the innocents suffering through this whole mess."
"Israel coz my people have suffered what  the Israelis suffered at the hands of Hamas.

Also how can someone with moral conscious support what Hamas did but Most Gaza people are doing so it's an easy choice."
"I would be on Israel side. Cause just now, Biden administration and Israel PMO both confirmed beheading of babies and toddlers by HAMAS TERRORISTS in Kafr Aza.

And yeah, France chose Palestine by illuminating Eiffel Tower in Israel Flag, USA chose Palestine by illuminating White House in Israel Flag and sending US Gerald, UK and Most of EU chose Palestine by Stopping their aid, UAE chose Palestine by condemning their actions. And many more countries are on Palestine Side."
"More support for Israel. It's similar to the entire region there. Israel IS in their ancestral lands. The Jewish predate Islam by thousands of years. The ancestral people have been neighbors in some fashion likely for all of history. 

Many people mistakenly believe Israel took something from Palestine.   They didn't.  But that's the basis for most of it. They think Israel is unusually brutal to Palestine. They aren't. Ppl should go look for themselves or open a few books."

"The native people? Jerusalem is historically Jewish. They were expelled from their land. Canaan. Israelites. Palestinians are philistines who migrated to the area. Roman's came. The turks came. They were pushed out. Then provided the land back to them. Because of the nature of diaspora you have this mix of who the Jewish are ethnically. So what?

It's not a Palestine vs israel thing. It's a terrorist in a blasphemous name of Islam vs Israel thing.

Israel did not colonize. They returned. And they aren't leaving again."
"Hamas is the result of DECADES of the same violence that Israel subjected the people of Palestine to, that they are experiencing rn. They didn't just wake up one day and decide to bomb and murder. Israel is a colonial state that has killed children and women in numbers that Hamas could never even reach. It is despicable that innocent civilians and children have suffered because of this, but a lot of them are the same people who have taken over the homes and lives of Palestinian people, murdered them, burned them alive, without consequences.

I think Palestinian people deserve their independence and the right to dignity and life that they have been deprived of for years. However, since peace talks between an oppressor and the oppressed cannot exist, it doesn't matter what side you take. There is no peaceful resolution. There is only surrender, and Palestine will once again have to do it, eventually. The world has too many disgusting greedy powerful forces to let humanity come before politics, religion and violence.

Any conversation on the same is also pointless. Israel will kill, Hamas will kill back. The news will sensationalise the war and earn TRP. Overall, no change will be made and people will die.

I know I will get downvoted but I don't really care. Ignorant people will continue spewing all sorts of hatred to justify their beliefs."
"Whole world isn't choosing Palestinine.
Only islam and left are supporting Palestinine. Countries with any sense of morality is supporting Israel.
Palestine should be freed from illegal occupation by Hamas"
only Ummah stsj ola uber fans support Palestine...
Op is delusional lol everyone is choosing Israel over the terrorists lol
Palestine had a moral reason but only a fool will hedge their bet on a losing side
Not full India supports Israel
"Palestine because Israel is a settler colonial State built on the blood of the native people. 

The Israelis are not native to the land, they are all European migrants."
entertain merciful sharp friendly secretive dazzling spark run crush capable ` this message was mass deleted/edited with redact.dev `
Palestine for me. Cause it's good to pronounce. I think that's why the whole world.
hamas killed civilians. israeli air force killed civilians in retaliation. ask the dead body on either side who's right and that is your answer
Konse world me rehte ho aap Jahaan Palestine ko support diya jaarha hai üòÇ
"I know a lot more Israelis and also have been to the place. But I don‚Äôt support IDF‚Äôs treatment of Palestine one bit. A lot of Israelis also don‚Äôt support it, but most of them can‚Äôt be vocal about it. At a certain age, they‚Äôre called to serve in the IDF and if they chose not to, they are jailed for a small period of time. 

I also can‚Äôt support anything that Hamas is doing. Hamas is the extreme result of decades of atrocities. People living in Gaza and innocent and are caught in the crossfire. 

That being said, I think Palestine needs justice. They need to come to an armistice. Enough of people (mostly Palestine) has suffered. Bombing and killing each other is not going to lead into any solution."
Duh. Check the countries who recognize Palestinian statehood before asking such questions.
The world is not choosing Palestine FYI. The pro Palestine protests are getting banned everywhere. UK just banned Palestine flag for time being. Berlin banned the pro Palestine protests. Keep your agenda to yourself. The pro Palestine protests are getting cancelled everywhere.
Simping way to victory...
This is the way.
"Clearly they are not referring to the government, a very small number of people. Polls show MAJORITY of people stand with Palestine. Worldwide."
"This is the correct answer. There is no 'good' side here. Israel has mistreated palestine like nobody's business, and hamas' response is less than noble. Heck, with the whirlwind of misinformation floating around social media, we can't even claim to know what is actually happening. 

This is like a family drama. There is no point in outsiders like us getting involved or offering opinions. As much as we may hate it, this is an internal affair, and us getting heated over it will only be seen as a weapon by the ones involved, not support. All we can do is hope the innocents get through this and asap."
"If you are an Indian, what if Arabic people come over to India and rule because Mughal ruled us and what if they claim this is our land because of that history?

by the way I am a Christian

&#x200B;

And if you are not an Indian, the current America is not filled with true Americans and the native Americans or red Indian has been wiped out from their own land."
No they aren't? Majority of Jews in Israel are not originally from palestine/cisjordan but from europe. The Palestinians arabs are the indigenous people of that area. Just because jewism is older Islam doesn't mean that the Palestinian ancestors came later. Their ancestors just had some other religion like Christianity.
"Lol what books are you reading? Zionist propaganda books? If you really want to understand the issue, read Ilan Pappe. 

Palestinians are the native people, whether it be Jews or Muslims, the Israelis are settler colonialists from Europe. If any place, the settlement of the Jewish people should have happened in Europe because that is where historically they were expelled from. 

You people with your tiny brains are too fixated on religion whereas the issue is much more complicated and nuanced. It‚Äôs a clear cut battle between the right to existence of the native people and a settler Colonialist State expanding it's Imperial power to make room for more accumulation of Capital."
"The Palestinian minister gave a very fitting reply to this. He said something along the lines of ‚Äú why didn‚Äôt you ask Israel to condemn all the atrocities they‚Äôve been committing on Palestine all these years?‚Äù . 


Israel has been ethnically cleansing an entire nation over decades and nobody bats an eye. Hamas were bound to retaliate at some point. Even they know they‚Äôre going to lose the war, this was more about displaying resistance and proving a point. 

Not a single human being with even an ounce of humanity will support the killing of people on either side. But the fact that Israel had to be attacked once ( while Palestinians have been facing this on the daily) for this to become an international issue just screams hypocrisy."
"Jerusalem wasn't just Jewish. It also had Christians and Muslims who existed with the Jews. That's why there are Palestinian Jews and Palestinian Christians. They co-existed peacefully.

It was religion and Zionism that told people Jerusalem is Jewish land. All of it is a big sham in the name of religion."
"No even bible didn't say that Isreal is owned by Jewish, there also Isreal people were migrated from Egypt by the help of Moses"
The people who are current in Israel aren't the original Jews. They are white people who follow Judaism.
"Propaganda without proof. Where is the global rallying cry?  Many many nations would speak up and point out the atrocities. They do in some fashion regarding every other situation. Particularly if it's been decades of it. It would be political suicide to support them.  Not saying they are perfect. But given the above, I'm inclined to believe the atrocities carried out, is pure evil. Those that did it = evil. Anyone condoning murdering  babies, is complicit in the act."
"Nah, you are spitting fire. This is exactly what this is."
The only right answer in this entire dumb sub
It's also rich Indians want to comment on isreal palestine but hate it when outsiders comment on Kashmir - which is our version of the gaza conflict. Both sides have been atrocious to the other but keep on pointing fingers as to who's worse. Ask a pandit who lost family and their home during the exodus vs kashmiris who live in the valley today who've lost family to the military and the atrocities done by them. People who live in glass houses should really not throw stones at others.
"Who came first jews or muslims? If today Kashmiri hindus go and claim there properties and lands in Kashmir will you call it settler colonialism. 

Judaism is an ethnic religion like parsi you can't convert and become jew.

Were mughals older than Hindus?

I will support any Cause of native Americans claiming their land"
"No, not true. You trying to paint israel as ""white"" is ignorant and wrong, and it isn't even hard to research without visiting to see for yourself.

Because of the spread of the faith and the diaspora with the establishment of a Jewish state, you'll likely see more 'European' looking people than neighboring states but you really are inserting baseless opinions and assumptions."
This is all factually incorrect. Try again.
"What is Israel supposed to do ? The two nation theory has been declined many times by Palestinians and if Hamas is not finished they will just attack again. It is Hamas to blame. What did they think while attacking civilians, raping and beheading them. Any nation has the right to retaliate. It's the cowardness of the Hamas to hide behind women and kids."
Well he didn't condemn Hamas and didn't you read my comment that you can't justify the massacre of 1200 innocent in the context of history.
"Christianity predates Islam by hundreds of years, and Judaism predates both by....a lot. 

Jerusalem is originally Jewish. Israel as israelites in the land of Canaan. Where the philistines (Palestinian) migrated to.

Don't need religion to know this, we have ancient secular Roman and Greek texts (among others) that tell us this."
"That biblical story is a return or something, idk.

Historically they resided in and around the land of canaan. And Jerusalem is Jewish."
That's incredibly ignorant and incorrect to say.
"Without proof? WITHOUT PROOF? There has been well documented articles, news reports and also nationally televised interviews where Israelis have boasted about killing people. Read the UN report for Gaza and Palestine. It shows kids and women killed by Israel greatly exceed that by Hamas. Just because you're an ignorant fucking fool doesn't mean there's no proof. Keep your eyes shut, clown. And get a life, you have been responding to this thread for over 24 hours now almost"
"The actual Jews were Semitic people who diverged into various groups and tribes and formed all kinds of political structures in the neighboring regions. All 3 of the Abrahmic religions stem from these same people only. All the people living there, whether the adherents of the old Judaism or the ones who formed and converted into new religions have a right on those lands. 

Who said you couldn't convert? The actual Jews were of Levantine origin whereas The Askenazi Jews who form the majority of the Jewish population worldwide are mostly White with their autosomal DNA indicating they are mixed with Europeans. These Askenazi Jews came after WW2."
"Majority of them are literally not from palestine, they had no ancestors there ever. That is just a fact. They are just colonisers, nothing else."
"Counter it then, how is it incorrect? 

Ah I get it this subreddit is filled with RW zealots who don't know anything, downvote me as much as you want, your hatred for Palestine only stems from your bigotry against Muslims."
"So what‚Äôs Palestine supposed to do? Dance to the sounds of daily bombings lol ? You really think the raping and beheading hasn‚Äôt been happening on the other side? You think Israel plays it clean? The are interviews of israeli soldiers boasting about raping 16yo. The problem is people already have a preformed notion of what they want to support, find 2-3 circulating reels that support their cause n come to stand for their cause ( instead of happening an open mind and seeing the atrocities committed on both sides before quoting viral reels lol). 

It‚Äôs easy for us to be sitting for in the comfort at our homes n type behind screens. These are very real people who have been oppressed over decades, undergoing a very real war.

Edit: spelling"
"The Israeli ministers haven‚Äôt condemned the atrocities they‚Äôve been carrying out against Palestine either but nobody questions that, was my point."
"I agree, the earliest people there were Jewish. Who you call Israelites, doesn't come from history but religious texts. There's a difference between Jewish people and Zionists. Not all Jews are Zionists and the idea that Jerusalem BELONGS to Jewish people has been ascertained by religious texts and Zionists."
"Palestinian people were living peacefully until Zionists came and took over the land. Please note, that even at that time, a lot of Jews lived in Palestine. They still exist as Palestinian Jews. Zionists and Jewish people are not the same."
"You too, and you've yet to produce anything other than propaganda.

And if and when you do...my first question is going to be...why?  

Most likely because they are retaliating against something. 

They've both bombed each other....back and forth, over contested areas.

Show me where they did what hamas did?

No, I'm educated and I've spent time in the middle east with a number of ethnic groups and know the realities first hand...besides having been a regular reader of middle eastern history and modern day geopolitics. 

And who is complicit in the support of baby murders? Not bombings that hit everyone. Individuals who snuck in and raided homes and personally raped and murdered families and children with knives. Laughing about it."
Let's For sake of argument I agree with you but does that absolve Hamas of what it did?
It's not a fact.
When there are 2 millions radicalised people that want to eradicate your nation you just can't let them do that. Hamas was elected by the people of Gaza in 2006. So you have to bear the consequences. You just can't bite the hand that feeds you. And what about the celebration of the massacre Palestinians were doing. Spitting on a naked body of a woman parading her and celebrating like a festival. No nation will tolerate it.
"They would have given refuge in surrounding countries if they didn't create coups wherever they went. In short Palestinians become destroyers of the countries, wherever they are death and destruction follows."
"They bomb each other over the contested areas. If one bombs another, the other responds in kind.

Palestine could just stop. It's really Hamas. 

And where is the footage and facts saying Israel did the same as hamas?"
Hamas started sucide bombing so Israel had to put restrictions. Hamas hides between civilians so it's hamas' fault that innocents get killed.
"I use the term to israelites to distinguish them from the general term of canaanites, which both terms are historically accurate. A lot of ""religious texts"" actually double as ancient historical texts and, when speaking of the people and its history, are largely corroborated by other ancient texts from places such as Egypt, Greece, Roman Empire, etc."
"Glad to find some sane people here, Lol this guy is a RW idiot with pure hated against Muslims, no point in arguing against such people, it‚Äôs not like your effort to teach them a lesson in history will change his heart."
"The number of different Jewish people are many.

Zionist or not, Jewish have been persecuted, conquered, and displaced often.   

Izionist or not, they all identify as Jewish. And most differentiate themselves from other indigenous people.

The violence is perpetuated by religious extremist hamas. 

What is internationally recognized is the civil war that lead to an independent Jewish state. 

The point is the disgusting acts hamas carried out and that people are actually saying Israel (as in the Jewish) should leave even though that IS their ancient homeland. 

It is the Palestinian as well but they as philistines migrated from the coast in ancient times. They both have claims but the Jewish have the stronger claim, the older claim and the current claim...as well as being internationally recognized as legitimate."
"I'm not? I haven't spoken one piece of propaganda. What I'm talking about is well documented truth done by the United Nations. 

https://www.unrwa.org/2014-gaza-conflict

Here is the link. You can read how many civilians died in Gaza as a result of Israeli bombing. 

""2,251 Palestinians were killed; 1,462 of them are believed to be civilians, including 551 children and 299 women. 66 Israeli soldiers and five civilians, including one child, were also killed. Overall, 11,231 Palestinians were injured during the conflict, including 3,540 women and 3,436 children. Roughly one third of these children will have to cope with disabilities lasting throughout life as a result of their injuries.""

Now if you can't read and will call this also propaganda, that's on you."
"Nope, not at all and I condemn Hamas completely."
"Do you absolve Israel of their ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians that has been going on for decades now? 

All I am saying is that this is not an isolated event and has to be seen in the right context, what Hamas(A Jihadi Islamist Organisation that I hate) has done now, Israel does on a regular basis without any repurcussion or accountability."
"There are nationally televised interviews of Israeli soldiers boasting about raping 16yo Palestinians, why didn‚Äôt you speak up about that? You‚Äôre literally basing ur opinion of a war that has been going on for decades over 2 reels without even digging into the crimes the other side has suffered. FYI that woman was eventually found in a hospital and I‚Äôve seen circulating articles how that whole thing was edited."
">When there are 2 millions radicalised people that want to eradicate your nation you just can't let them do that.

But Palestinians should let the millions of radical Israelis eradicate them?

If you are so disgusted by war crimes then you shouldn't support Israel either."
"So why doesn‚Äôt Israel seek refuge ? Considering they have all the super powers backing up, they should seek refuge in any of these countries that will accept them with open arms lol. But dropping bombs over decades and being surprised on facing retaliation is the way Israel to go about it ?! 
If the Palestinians are expected to bear logic and move out, makes more sense for Israel to be doing that tbh. The hypocrisy lol"
https://reddit.com/r/list_palestine/s/8KR6Khx80A
I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre asking for footage of Israel doing the same‚Ä¶just do one google search..the ignorance is soo real I cannot believe this
So whose fault was it for the millions of Palestinians that have gotten killed over decades and nobody took a stand ? Why the hypocrisy is what I‚Äôm asking ?
Nope. The term Israel itself comes from the Bible. Jacob and his twelve sons fled to Egypt from where they were led by Moses to Canaan. That forms the core of what we know today as Israel. It's in the Torah too and even actual scholars agree it is not an accurate description of the origins of Israel.
"Zero hatred. But you are spreading lies. Such ignorance is pathetic.

I'm not against Islam or Palestine. I'm not claiming Israel is perfect either.

My statements are true.

Hamas is evil for brutally murdering babies.

Where is your heart?"
"You are a fucking idiot if after all that explaining shit doesn't go into your head. People of different faiths were co-existing peacefully until Zionists came and started their colonial rule. It wasn't Muslims who started killing Jews and taking their land. Claim on the land is based on fucking religious scripture. Before the Zionists, no Jewish people were killing Muslims and taking their land.

Zionists did to Palestinians what Germans did to the Jews. Even right now, there are a lot of Jews who are and have been calling for an end to the inhumane treatment and oppression against Palestinians.

Hamas is a result of Israel's continued oppression of Palestinian people OVER DECADES. They created this evil, and yes it is evil. But Israel is to blame for it. Your comprehensive skills are blinded by your hatred but that's more than half of Indian reddit who barely use logical analysis and empathy while absorbing history. Keep up your rant, engaging with this stream of echo chamber voices is unbearable."
"So, I read actual UN reports from the UN.

As I keep stating, israel is not perfect. They essentially do the same to each other, and Israel shouldn't be attacking contested areas or purposely targeting civilians.

At no point did I say I'm against Palestine or Islam, nor did I say I'm for Israel unequivocally.

What I stated is still fact.

Hamas is an extremist terrorist organization supported by Iran for a geopolitical agenda. They murdered babies and families brutally. It goes far beyond bombing each other. They also call for jihad across the globe etc. It's wanton violence. 

That is what I'm against. I'll support holding Israel accountable for its violations, but Israel is a recognized state and they still belong in their territory. 

Hamas absolutely needs to be eliminated. Israel should leave the contested areas as they legally belong to Palestine. 

And people should not be complicit in supporting any baby murderer. No need for the whatabout-ism. Any baby murderer is inexcusable."
Is hisab se kya india ko pakistanis pr hamas jaise attacks krne chaiye ya kashmiri hindus bhi hamas jaise groups bana le? Kisi pr julm hua h to kya bachhon ko marega?
"What about the massacre of 260 people in the peace music festival, and what about the kid executed in front of her parents and siblings and what about the people that were killed on their beds.Don't just justify the barbarism.  Palestine elected this government. they have to bear the consequences."
"I guess the oppressed people decided to take revenge on kids, women and elders so that way they can free their land. They thought beheading them , slitting their throats burning them alive would make Palestine free from israel."
Did Israeli people attack Palestinians?
They indeed seek refuge in Europe until Hitler showed up and survivors went back to their place besides all that Jewish population in surrounding countries dropped from millions to couple thousands. Iran was one of the largest Jewish population state after Islam the population dropped to 8k in 2021.
Well you can't just let the people whatever they want when their sole purpose is to eradicate your nation.
"Sure, scholars agree that various secular texts that corroborate the additional ancient ""religious texts"" are wrong.

Where you are headed is purely a linguistic argument that really has no bearing on what I'm talking about.

Use the term Canaan and canaanites then.

Earliest term of Israel is egyptian as well, which predates the Bible by 1,500-2,000 years.

The history of judiasm likely goes back further IN that region of canaanites, Judah, the Levant in general. 

But it's what we also label them today, in academia. 

I'm really not sure what you're trying to say or why...but it continues to sound inaccurate."
"Are you dumb or just lack basic comprehension skills, I have condemned Hamas, they are Jihadis."
"There are periods of co existence, yes, those exist too.

And the entire world somehow tolerates this?"
"But that's the thing, Israel has never been held accountable in these decades of oppression. People are quick to jump the gun to blame Hamas. They're apologists, just like you are. Apologists for genocide and a settlement colonial state.

You say Israel isn't perfect, having killed more babies and women than Hamas could never even come close to. Condemnation of the oppressed using violence to fight back, while calling the oppressor 'less than perfect' is absolute hypocrisy.

Also, about the children beheadings, the White House just denied that Biden saw pictures of those. The only ones following this narrative are Israel, the people who have been continually portraying themselves as victims while continuing to kill thousands of Palestinians. They manufacture content without proof to give them excuses to perpetuate acts of war.

Lastly, bombings isn't the only way Palestinians are killed. They are burned alive by Israeli settlers (including children), denied access to water and food and electricity. People in Gaza live in the largest open air prison in the world. I have more links and clips for you to learn from, but given your absolute defence for Israel, calling them not perfect for committing war crimes, I don't think you'll need it."
"Gaza is called the biggest open air jail in the World, it's heavily surrounded by IDF soldiers at all times, who basically do whatever they feel like doing with the people, their movement is restricted by Israel and so is their subsistence, they have to rely on Israel for everything, from electricity to food. 

Kya tum Pakistani soldiers se surrounded rehte ho at all times, who can fu*k you up anytime they want? Kya tumhe apne hi country me idhar udhar jane ke liye Pakistani checkposts se guzarna parta hai? 

Hamas ko maine kab defend kiya bhai, I just said it's an inevitavle reaction to decades of systematic oppresiion, it's easier for you and me living comfy lives to moralise oppressed people.

It's quite clear ki tereko ghanta kuchh aata jaata nhi hai, you just saw a couple of videos 2 din pehle aur aa gua yahan Israel Palentine karne, beta jake ek aadha Kitab padho is subject matter pe. You are too ""Phillistine"" to know anything nor you have the IQ."
Nobody should be killed. Especially women and children. But the same sympathy should‚Äôve been extended to the Palestinians all these years. The fact that it becomes an issue only when it‚Äôs Israel under attack screams hypocrisy. Period.
Yes they have been conlonizing the west bank which the world agree is palestine territory for years and idf has been killing Palestinian children every week at this point.
"They didn't seek any refuge in Europe, they WERE Europeans, you don't seek refuge for hundreds of years.

There was substantial Jewish population in the Middle East, in fact Jews enjoyed better social status under the Muslim rulers, they prospered and became merchants, academicians, doctors etc during the Islamic Golden Age. In fact, some of the biggest traders in the Arab World back then were Jews, compare this to the treatment of Jews in Europe, where they were ghettoised, expulsed multiple times, couldn't acquire any noble position in the kigdom.

The Jewish exodus from the Muslim World is a rather recent event."
"Once again, Israel has literally been eradicating Palestinians over decades ..where was your concern then lol"
"All I'm saying is, the ones who came claiming the land to be theirs and called it Israel were Zionists. They started the colonial rule. Natives to a region doesn't mean they have the solitary right to it. Palestine had Jews, Christians and Muslims co-existing until Zionists came and called the land their rightful heritage, because their book claims it to be."
"I think you mistake my position. 

I support humanity. I support facts.  The UN reports did not mention any atrocities as committed by hamas.

Again, hamas is an Iran backed terrorist organization that has called for the deaths of innocent citizens from other countries.  Not okay.

Palestine and Israel, the people of the region has waged this war in some shape or fashion throughout all of recorded history, with relatively brief pauses of respite or peace.

Hamas is the evildoers today. Hold them all accountable for what the facts support.

That's my position.

Innocents should never be targets by either side. Babies should not be murdered.

As i stated before, hold any intentional baby murderer accountable. 

Specific language because I'm specifically not an apologist of any sort."

Mujhe maaf kr aur comment section se nikal pehli fursat mn"
"Well Palestinians rejected two states solution 9 times, then they became radicalised. They started proxy war. What Israel is supposed to do. And the killings of Palestinians occurred mostly because of the Hamas. Hamas hides behind the innocents and uses them as sheids than attack you so what do you expect from israel they just can't let Hamas attack them."
"They have been getting billions of dollars in funding. What did they do- buy rockets, weapons, train terrorists etc."
"You are talking an exchange of bombings.  Whereas Israel has regularly targeted the aggressors who hide amongst innocents while hamas or Palestine targets civilians purposely. 

West Bank is a contested area. We can condemn Israel for it if they are on the offensive with violence. Sure.

But let's not condone raping and murdering families and babies with knives by sneaking into neighborhoods by anyone. 

And Hamas is who did it. Yet people are supporting them, evil. Because of half truths and propaganda."
Go over and tell the Israeli that. Vast majority of them look like any other average citizen in the middle east.
"All kinds of shit happened in past. The Islamists started killing men and converting women after they lost Arab war with Israel the same process is happening in Pakistan and Bangladesh with hindus.
Indians support Israel bcoz we know what kind of a disease Islamic terrorism is."
Does it justify the massacre of 1200 people. Don't spam the same story. Tell me how the killing of 1200 civilians helps the palastine movement. It's just made it impossible. Why were they celebrating.
"They did that 3,000 years ago also. Except they were canaanite Jewish, Judah Jewish, Levant in general Jewish. (Not the actual names but the regions)

Edit: and I think it has more to do with the regular persecution and displacement of the Jewish in the region. ""Zionists"" were more like the match that was lit. The fuel to burn was already there."
"Okay then don't say Israel is less than perfect. Say Israel is the evil and Hamas is the result of that evil. I agree no civilians should be hurt in such matters but it is also the same civilians who kill and burn Palestinians. The bottom line is, Israel is not even facing half the violence they have been subjecting Palestinians to, over decades. We should condemn Hamas, but the foremost thing to do is to stop Israel and it's injustices because it has gone too far and for too long. Hamas isn't some terrorist organisation that decided to kill Israelis on a whim or because of a religious dictat. They do so because they are tired of seeing their people killed and tortured and denied basic human rights over generations. Condemn Israel first. Stop their injustices, hold them accountable for what they have done. And then talk about Hamas.

And yes, eventually, Hamas should be held accountable too. But you can't expect a liberation movement for freedom to not be violent. Yes, who is subjected to that violence is wrong, but first say that to all the mothers who lost their children in Gaza before evening beginning to talk about the Israelis. The Palestinians have had their babies and families murdered and tortured by Israelis over generations."
"Bro it‚Äôs so fucking simple

Idf bad for human right violations and Hamas bad for human right violations

"Brother, firstly thank you for being respectful and civil about the discussion. Secondly, you really really need to keep your bias aside and educate yourself on the matter a little more. Take a look at the number of deaths and rapes Palestinians have faced on the regular basis before the hamas attack. They‚Äôve now just retaliated. Please give me a single reliable source stating that Palestine has received billions in funding. In fact the entire issue is that major world powers like UK and USA are backing up Israel openly. Israel has been ethnically cleansing Palestinians for decades with 0 consequences. 

People need to understand that the big rich boys of Middle East won‚Äôt take a stand cuz they don‚Äôt have to be worried about being voted out, they‚Äôre a monarchy. The world leaders don‚Äôt go and fight the war themselves, they don‚Äôt care about the people dying. They‚Äôre doing wtv helps them earn brownie points that help them win their next elections."
"There was a massive influx of Jews from the Middle East into Israel starting from 1947 but still the overwhelming majority traces their ancestry back into Europe, the majority is Askenazi Jew."
The number of non Muslims that go and thrive in Middle East living their tax free life would suggest otherwise lol. History wasn‚Äôt easy on anyone. Wars and surrendering was the norm. The west propagated Islamophobia to cover up their own shit and the world ate it up.
"In every other argument, your blatant hatred of Muslims and victim mentality crops up, it‚Äôs so draining to argue with people like you. 

The material conditions in South Asia and the Middle East are DIFFERENT, please read before you come here yapping. You seem to beleive that Muslims are a cult of people whose existence rests upon the sole ambition of destroying other religions, which is such a pathetically ludicrous idea, how come Jews thrived in the Islamic World and not in the Christian World then? Islamic Terrorism is a recent phenomena, read up on how Imperial powers gave birth to it. Ideas don't run the World, Material circumstances do.

Please read up on the subject instead of wasting everyone's time with mindless drivel Muh Muslims Bad, Saar we Victims too saar, Israel our brothers saar."
"I hear you.

 I'd still need to see more evidence to support how long it's went because I believe they both have been doing it to each other this entire time.

It also doesn't take into account the Israeli persecution that made them feel that perhaps some Palestinian feel today.

Not sure drawing a line in the sand and saying everything after this point is what counts.

I'd also condemn both sides at the same time.

I could perhaps understand, but using evil as an excuse to do evil is not an excuse. I won't budge there. I won't condone any evil for any reason."
"I will only say one last sentence no one can justify murdering babies on account of any previous atrocity done to them.

Agar tum keh rhe ho ki previous action se ye situation bni to aise peeche jaate jaate to tum pre islamic times mn pahunch jao ya usse bhi pehle jab sab africa mn the.

Only solution will come through table aur is samay jo Israel act kr rha h vo hamas k khilaf h jo ek terrorist organisation h aur vo is samay hamas mn chhupi h Israeli hostage k saath.



Koi bhi country ho uski pehli jimmedari apne logon ko h to israel vahan pe un ko avenge krne aur apne hostages ko chhudane k liye is samay jo kr rha h vo justifiable h 

Rhi baat Gaza citizens ki to vo log ne hi hamas ko Ek tarah se elect kra aur support kra aur hamas action ko celebrate kr rhe the to kya option h Israel k pass.

West bank side to PLO pr Israel ne koi attack nhi kiya sirf Hamas controlled Gaza pr kiya h. Kisi Gaza citizen ko Egypt kyon nhi le rha apne yahan.

And what do you expect from a nation when you kill their innocent citizens brutally. What was Hamas trying to achieve here . Didn't hamas think of the consequences of this. Why would any country support Palestine when there are dozens of videos circulating where people are being killed mercilessly and Hamas has captured 150 hostages why would anyone support Palestine. Hamas should have gone for the IDF not for the citizens. Palestine lost all its sympathy of years. Sadly innocents will suffer because of the foolish decision of Hamas.
The number people that got turned into slaves are far fucking more.

Bro Israel has opeeenllyyy v v v openllyyyyyy been killing Palestinians for years and years on a regular basis‚Ä¶.I really do hope you know that????? Hamas attacked right now but why are you not taking into account all the thousands of Palestinians that get killed and raped on a regular basis????What do you have to say about that????? Or do you want me to send Videos circulating of that tooooo?
"The labour class that goes to work as labour class won‚Äôt end up with the job of doctors lol. However the Middle East values degrees, pedigrees and Caucasian-ness over ppls religion when it comes to job opportunities (as they should)."

Ye nafrat paal ke bhai jeevan nhi chalta, padho - likho, reflect karo, duniya ko samajhne ki koshish karo. 

Just accept the fact that you like the that Palestinians are getting killed everyday, it makes you feel great because you are bigoted against them and move on. Why even bother debating people online when your entire agenda is that only."
"Still it isn't like Gaza citizens don't support Hamas if it would have been so PLO would have conducted elections but they know among average palestinians Hamas has more support.

Hamas has kept Gaza hostage but this is because Gaza has allowed Hamas and celebrated Hamas.

A viable Solution for the Palestinians to the Israel Palestine problem can only be through talks on the table.

Violence can only achieve destruction for either the Palestinians or whole of the Middle east.

Don't forget US and UK have their aircraft carriers in the Mediterranean.

Also don't forget the help Israel has provided to Indian government in Kargil."
Well it's on you to decide.
It's not like I'm ignoring it I'm just saying in the name of Palestine people are supporting Hamas. People celebrated the massacre of Israel in the name of free Palestine. That's not the way. No one condemned Hamas and Hamas did more damage to Palestinians than Israel ever did. Now Israel has a licence to kill as much as they want yet people are not ready to say that Hamas is responsible. If they want peace they should release the captives first then Hamas shall surrender ( won't happen) . Why would Israel stop bombing if it has a clear enemy that's going to attack again. Israel's goal is to eradicate Hamas. Now it's on Hamas to surrender or see their people die. I don't want Palestinians to die but you can't leave Hamas alive to attack again.
"Wow, You're not only a degenerate islamist, you are also a classist and racist too"
I really don't give a fuck what happened in opposite side of the world. Palestinians have all the advantages but they blew it with coups.
"Copying from below : you‚Äôre dying on the hill of ‚ÄúNoBODY cOnDeMnED hAMaS‚Äù ‚Ä¶without once acknowledging that nobody condemned Israel ALL THESE YEARS‚Ä¶Hamas is the result of DECADES of the same violence that Israel subjected the people of Palestine to, that they are experiencing rn. They didn't just wake up one day and decide to bomb and murder. Israel is a colonial state that has killed children and women in numbers that Hamas could never even reach. It is despicable that innocent civilians and children have suffered because of this, but a lot of them are the same people who have taken over the homes and lives of Palestinian people, murdered them, burned them alive, without consequences.

I think Palestinian people deserve their independence and the right to dignity and life that they have been deprived of for years. However, since peace talks between an oppressor and the oppressed cannot exist, it doesn't matter what side you take. There is no peaceful resolution. There is only surrender, and Palestine will once again have to do it, eventually. The world has too many disgusting greedy powerful forces to let humanity come before politics, religion and violence.

Any conversation on the same is also pointless. Israel will kill, Hamas will kill back. The news will sensationalise the war and earn TRP. Overall, no change will be made and people will die.

I know I will get downvoted but I don't really care. Ignorant people will continue spewing all sorts of hatred to justify their beliefs."
"Nope, I‚Äôm a realist. There‚Äôs literally a 30-40% salary increment if you‚Äôre a European in kuwait (which is where I grew up fyi). There are Asians working in every social strata. You can‚Äôt deny the fact that these countries depend on south east Asians to make up for their labour class ( despite their religion). I‚Äôm literally speaking facts, I‚Äôm sorry if it doesn‚Äôt sound like music to your delusional ears lol."
You call me biased but you are yourself biased. I can bet you are muslim. you don't see the situation of Israeli people and their sufferings. You just believe the massacre is justified because Israel did the same so Hamas is right. Palestinians want the complete area that's not possible you can't migrate 8 million people. Two states solution is the only way but Palestine doesn't agree with it. So I guess sadly the powerful will rule . Violence would take Palestine nowhere. Violence shall never be justified. I see the pro Palestine supporting the massacre so why cry when someone is doing the same with you. I am completely against the violence but one side sees it subjective so the other would do the same.
"That‚Äôs the easiest game to play here : I can bet 200% on the fact that you‚Äôre not a Muslim lmao. In fact I‚Äôm sure you find a way to justify ur Islamophobia while not agreeing to the fact you‚Äôre an islamophobe lol. You‚Äôre once again coming here and crying here about the sufferings of the Jews, ( which I do acknowledge btw- wars suck in general‚Ä¶nobody deserves to die like this ) but you‚Äôre literally not for once acknowledging the Palestinian genocide that has been going on for decades. The people celebrating the Hamas massacre aren‚Äôt the ones who will go to war for Palestine if it comes down to that. They‚Äôre not the victims or the representatives here. Look into the plight of people who are actually suffering and decide better for yourself. 

You‚Äôre literally blissfully ignoring the fact that Hamas has attacked right now while this had been happening in Palestine for years. The chronology of these events is important in deciding who is the oppressor and who is the oppressed. The rejection of 2 state theory seemed unfair because of the borders and the area of land under distribution. Palestinians rejected the proposal, they didn‚Äôt start attacking civilians while being backed up by the strongest nations in the world‚Ä¶that‚Äôs something that Israel did. You keep forgetting that Palestinians were being attacked all these years, they retaliated now."
"Simple in points
1) I acknowledge the bad things Israel did
2) I'm not islamophobic ( you called me biased so I said it too)

Questions for you just answer clearly -

1)  what was Hamas trying to achieve by killing civilians
2) how should Israel deal with terrorists that killed and abducted your citizens
3) Why should Israel not bomb the terrorists areas when they are firing missiles
4) isn't it right to wipe out Hamas that is a terrorist group and a threat for your nation.

"1. You haven‚Äôt really acknowledged all the bad things Israel did until now ( thank u for that tho). So how do u justify all that? And what do u think is the solution, Palestine should stay chill n get bombed ? 

2. Oh sweetie we both know better about that rn..but sooner or later it will be the new normal ..dw about it xD 

Questions - 
For the 1000th time 

1. Hamas retaliated for what is being done to Palestine for years by doing The same literal thing. ( whilst knowing they will have to bear the consequences which they are). 

2. Israel has been dealing with the people by literally killing Palestinians over years. The war has been on for years. They were holding a music festival at a site where 1000s of people are held captives. Palestenians are held captives and they retaliated. If you get the logic for Israel, why not for Palestine ? 

3. For the 100000 time, Israel had been bombing Palestine for decades. They retaliated now and it‚Äôs an international issue where the minister of Israel openly claiming to have cut the water and electricity supplies and is somehow still the oppressed one ??Are you following this ? 

4. They‚Äôre not just wiping out Hamas. They are and have been bombing civilians ( including children and women) for decades and still continue to do so. Resistance means Palestine isn‚Äôt trying to win the war in numbers here. They‚Äôre trying to take a stand. Keeping mum and being in the good books of the rules brought no good because enough people didn‚Äôt condemn Israel. They‚Äôre fighting back now. The sad part is it shouldn‚Äôt have come down to this.

You thought you really did something with these questions lol. While you‚Äôre not even acknowledging the fact that Palestinians retaliated after facing decades of same Violence in the hands of Israel."
Well it's not the answer to my question is it?
"Lol you are justifying the killing of 1200 civilians by historical context it's really sad and ironic. Well if Hamas knew the consequences so let them bear the consequences. They brought it to themselves. If they would have attacked IDF it could be considered as retaliation. The thing that Hamas did was a total massacre of innocents. You have double standards when it comes to life . Palestinians lives are important whereas it is fine to kill , rape and behead Israeli civilians."
Now see the list too‚Ä¶you wouldn‚Äôt have asked those questions lol.
"Nope. You‚Äôre justifying the killings of 1000s of Palestinians all these decades cuz it fits the pre formed notion you have of a certain sect. If you‚Äôre going to be racist, at least be racist with a spine and own it up lol.

The fact you think it is okay to kill and rape Israel people as a revange is very disturbing. Then I say Israel bombing is also justified as a retaliation.

Retaliation should not be on innocent people. I guess you don't care.
Hehe tik tok is banned you know but never mind keep spreading your propaganda nothing matters now. Neither you nor I can stop what is happening or what will happen in future.
It's strange that you care only if the victim is Palestinian . Well never mind Hamas will be gone for good in a few days I pray for the innocent that are going to be killed in this mess.

Am I really an Indian if I don't have one?
"Neither because it's related to an Abrahamic prophecy and I am not Abrahmic.

This is what Jews believe:

""These prophecies require three great events before the Messiah can return: the nation of Israel must be restored; Jerusalem must be a Jewish city; and the Temple, the center of worship and sacrifice in the ancient Jewish world, which was last destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D., must be rebuilt.""

Evangelical Christians also believe that Jews need to be in Israel for their prophecy to be fulfilled which is why so many evangelical Christians send funding to Israel:

""Christian believers are instructed by Scripture to acknowledge the Hebraic roots of their faith and to actively assist and participate in the plan of God for the Ingathering of the Jewish People and the Restoration of the nation of Israel in our day.""

This is what Muslims believe about end times/judgement day:

""It is narrated in the hadith that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: ‚ÄúThe Hour will not begin until you fight the Jews, until a Jew will hide behind a rock or a tree, and the rock or tree will say: ‚ÄòO Muslim, O slave of Allah, here is a Jew behind me; come and kill him ‚Äì except the gharqad (a kind of thorny tree).""

Muslim: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_eschatology

"Neither one.

Both sides have done their share of crap so neither one is worth defending at all.

I am glad people now aren't believing the media about this war and their biased coverage anymore. They've peddled lies long enough and gotten away with it."
I just feel that the civilians are not at any fault and they shouldn't pay the price of their leaders' ego

The only reason India implies neutrality is not because it has any sympathy for Palestine but it simply doesn‚Äôt want to offend Arab states."
"Neither.

Both sides believe in collective punishment and that they have more right to live than the other. The only support they are asking is for the world to turn a blind eye to their atrocities. 

They do not see two state solution as viable and in all deliberations of single state they want to reduce the other community as second class citizens."

"The whole fiasco is a shitty game show where innocent lives are losing. No side is completely faultless but Hamas is a religious fanatic group who would not stop just here and may inspire a lot such groups all over the world, had they succeeded here."
mujhe kya merko toh ww3 ka intezaar hai
"I believe that a country's first priority is to secure their own citizens' lives. Israel letting Hamas off the hook this time would be a grave injustice to the Israelis who have to live in continued fear of such attacks. Hamas are cowards, secretly supported by surrounding Arabic nations. Egypt has actually murder Palestinians and destroyed their houses when they tried to cross over so don't buy any of their bs about the poor Palestinians.

Hamas has ensured that when Israel retaliates, innocent lives in Gaza will be lost. They hide in hospitals, schools etc. They set up launching pads for their missiles in civilian areas. They block Palestinians from evacuation during war. Hamas as an organisation has been nothing but brutal to the Palestinians too.

Diplomacy is based on mutual respect. If you sit quietly because you value innocent lives, when they clearly don't, you are asking for the cycle to repeat over and over.

Hamas and Palestine have refused to even agree to the 2 nation pact since the 1990s. Israel is willing but they aren't. They openly say that we don't want a single Jew in this area.

Please note that 20% of Israelis are actually muslim, they live in peace. They vote. Palestinians and Hamas have been known to kill/harass Jews on their side of the border. If not today, it would happen tomorrow. Hopefully Israel manages to take action that brings about stability from now on at least."
"Let me start by saying that I believe Palestinians deserve a viable state. However, I am absolutely horrified by what Hamas did. Hamas needs to be punished. But the way Israel is exacting revenge by razing down Gaza is deplorable and condemnable. The Arab states should also be condemned for not using their influence. Iran and Qatar have blood on their hands.

I am on the side of civilians caught between this barbaric show of dicks between Israel and Hamas. 

The right wing Hindu and Muslim jokers who blindly support one party over another should be caned on their butts. These do takke ke log are a bane to our country."
I mean one of them gave them time leave the city within 24hours before they bomb the city. The other is saying to stay put...
"If Israel has no right to exist, as advocated by Arabs and  all other muslim nations that refuse to recognize it because it is ""Islamic Land"" that they claim belongs to Palestine.

Then Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan also have no right to exist as they too have taken Hindu Land. Iran has no right to exist as it took Parsi Land and on and on and on it goes.

The terrorists and the nations were posting about their support for ""Palestine"" while the brutal attack by Hamas was ongoing where babies were beheaded and women raped. That alone exposes their mindset and its support for terrorism that favours them. These same countries go mute when someone in their ummah blows himself up in a street full of innocents in the name of Jihad."
"Not really on the side of either but the attacks on civilians need to stop . They were initially done by Hamas but now Israel has taken it too far. They‚Äôre basically slaughtering women and children at this point in Gaza and they have been a brutal apartheid state for a while. 

I feel like the real blame is in Colonial Britain for deciding to create Israel out of someone else‚Äôs land. For some reason they have escaped all blame and accountability. And then second comes the American military industrial complex who will push for more extreme wars because they make so much money off them. People are just fodder for them."
"Israel has supported India in the past. I don't see any reason to support Hamas terrorists and their so-called ""peaceful religion"" (which is literally the reason for half of the attacks globally)."
"Israel üôåüèª

What Hamas is doing there with the civilians is gut wrenching

I just wanna see all those terrorists destroyed by israel"
"Take whichever stance you want to based on your research and information available, just don't go too far with it that it leads you to either Islamophobia or Anti-semitism. Don't believe all the crap shown on any of the news outlets for that matter they all have their own agendas set. That being said, you can support Palestinian aspirations without defending the actions of Hamas, and you can also sympathize with Israeli civilians without defending IDF or going all out against pro-palestinians.

I believe rather than giving it a religious tadka, one should see it as a cycle of violence and terrorism. And it just doesn't sit right with me to compare which side is more in the wrong. They both are. One life gone and thousands of life gone, terrorism is terrorism. I sympathise with innocent civilians on both the sides. It's a shame that money talks in real world and of course everyone's gonna be looking at what benefits them. I know it's harsh but it is what it is. This is not a black and white matter. Both sides are wrong in this. It's just that one is a full-fledged designated terror organization, and the other side with power knows this very well."
Fuck religions. Also that one particular one always associated with terrorism.

And for Information of Bhakts Putin will support Palestine if required."
I support Israel.
Israel is doing right with their scorched earth policy. They will be destroyed by all muslim countries who support terrorists if they don't show their full might. But this looks like world war 3 is starting to take its face and I don't like that.

Israel. Without an iota of doubt
"Israel is a coloniser so I will never support that. It has been keeping the Palestinians in an open air prison.
And this does not mean supporting Hamas or their atrocities."
Israel is best.
Israel created the monster known as Hamas because of years of exploitation. Now Hamas is striking back and Israel is playing the victim card. Neither side should be murdering civilians to demonstrate their point but I think Israel government should be tried and executed in public court and Hamas government (after being punished for war crimes) should have a guarantee given to them about their citizen's lives and freedom from exploitation. Of course all this is only possible if the most powerful countries in the world interfere but seems like everyone already bought into Israel's victim card playing. So I have no hope for this situation.
None of any Indian citizens' business.

This isnt an effing sports match where you have to take sides. Innocents are dying on both sides because of the extremist ideologies of religious settler zionism on one hand and islamic fundamentalism on the other. Have some shame.
One can be a victim and a perpetrator at the same time. So no sides.... Sympathetic towards those who are innocent and hurt because in the fight of elephants it's the grass that is hurt.
It doesn‚Äôt matter which side you are. It‚Äôs always the ordinary person who suffers at the hands of war mongering politicians and their LDE.
"None of them are worth taking sides of because both are killing civilians and deep down even their civilians wanted this kind of war like people in India and pakistan, but noticing that whom India can get some benefits in future, Israel."
Innocents. I side with innocent people.
"2 polar radicals are having a dick measuring competition and civilians are paying the price. Palestine had some support but they have been radicalised to the point of no return. They called for Jihad on India before during the whole Nupur Sharma thing after we provided them vaccines. Clearly, Palestinians aren't people that work with logic. They just want the worst for the people who they don't like."

This is becoming a never ending saga of killing on both sides. I don't care now who is right or wrong, this needs to end. Nothing good is coming out of it. Soon there won't be any people to fight for from both sides!!!!"
I'm not taking either sides but anyone who kills civilians who are unable to defend themselves is just vile disgusting terrorists. I'm pretty sure of that!
"Any Indian who supports Israel just because they hate Muslims is wrong at the same time any Indian who supports Hamas killing innocent civilians is also wrong. If they can't live peacefully together they should have seperate and clear boundaries with none interfering with the other unlike how it is now, where Palestine is under indirect rule of Israel and Hamas shelling Israel when they were blindsided...."
Condemn attacks on civilians from both sides. Support victims on both sides
I'm on the side of civilians from both sides.
"It's don't matter to me I am anyways live in India .

"There are bad eggs on both sides. I firmly believe that the average Israelis and Palestinians just want a normal peaceful existence. But they are caught up in the geopolitical games of America, Russia and Iran."
Palestinian resistance are basically children who've grown up under occupation and apartheid in an open air concentration camp. When you're devoid of the essential human right of freedom you fight to be free or die. It's really that simple. Ask yourself what yo n would have done if you were kept in a prison all your life from the time you were born??

"Israel

People writing innocent people on bith sides are seriously deluded to think that palestine has ""innocent people"" who dont support hamas and their methods. When israeli innocent children and women were taken as hostages and paraded naked through the streets, these exact ""injocent people cheered for hamas. Hamas is an elected organization and the Palestinian people support hamas, so in essence they brought this upon themselves."
"I believe Palestinians should get their own country.

Israel is a settler colonial state and have occupied Palestine for the last 75 years.

It has violated all UN resolutions and kept on driving Palestinians into refugee camps.

So I guess Israel needs to be held accountable for its war crimes, made to follow UN resolutions and be forced to let Palestinians have their own country."
"I think that both governments are complete assholes, Hamas is a group of terrorists and a bunch of religious pricks are completely decimating the lives of civilians. Both Israel and the Hamas group are awful."
"I generally support the more progressive group anywhere. That's Israel here.

I think Palestinians should be given a separate land parcel somewhere away from Israel. And Israel needs to stop expanding by force. Maybe buy land from arabs."
It should be israel or hamas.

"my opinion, (most) Indians live only limited to India, who know only few bites of knowledge of anything outside of India, they usually look at the surface, easy to gather knowledge that are usually from social media post which everyone know are targeted and curated to get the most out of the users time, in simple you get what you like because what you like is the thing you gonna give more time to aka echo chamber, 

Indians also see everything black or white for example they will come at you saying ""palistinians democraticly elected hamas blah blah"" and doesn't consider anything outside of it like what constant and neglected oppression for decades can do and what are their options to overcome oppression( they will come something stupid like "" once oppressed can never be oppressers ever never 100 Uber True fact that is as basic as fire is hot there is no other way"") , how each option works out, they also don't know laws of war, what's the difference is between casualty of war and war crime or genocide, they also don't understand decades of geo politics that comes into play when talking about such things and verifying actions by considering biases of each player , all they point out is snippets of facts, sometimes even lies or misinterpretion to advance thier own thinking,

I know I'm gonna be told to go to Pakistan or leave India or anti nation or uneducated or tees Mar khan or something like that for this comment, but I am at a point I simply don't care anymore

"As a human, I support humanity. I support innocent people who are squashed in war zones because their only fault is to be born there. I STRONGLY condemn what Hamas did to innocent Israelis but I equally condemn what IDF is doing to innocent Palestinians. Bombing hospitals, ambulances, universities, white phosphorus over the city, depriving them of water and electricity is simply inhumane. I hope those who are guilty get rightfully punished but on the pretext of finishing hamas IDF has lost the plot. They are literally called occupants because they what they‚Äôre doing is illegal.

"¬† A Jewish nation-state, on the objective facts, should not have been established in Palestine in the first place.

Jews made up only 5-10% of the population of Palestine in 1900. In 1947, they only formed 32-33% of the population thanks in no small part to illegal immigration. They were in minority in all sub-dsitricts except Jaffa and in no sub-district did they own more land than Arabs.

The absurdity of the partition proposal is demonstarted by the fact that Beersheba was awarded to the Jews while it only had about a thousand Jews but a hundred thousand Arabs. 

Even in the entire Palestine, Jews made up only a third of the population. These are the facts."
"Morally speaking killing of innocent people is wrong, war should be fought between trained combatants. Without delving in the history what hamas did was wrong and any other nation capable enough would have taken the same steps as israel did."
Whoever wins and whomever support has better benefit for India.
"Definitely. But if you choose Hamas, you're definitely not."

"Where were you when Israel killed, tortured and raped people? Why are they not called terrorists when the settlers attacked the civilians? They are committing genocide and you support Israel? They are committing ethnic cleansing and war crimes, and you support Israel? They said they will let civilians ""evacuate"", but then they Target the evacuation truck and kill 70 Palestinians. You support Israel? Settler Israelis killed Palestinians in the west bank( where Hamas isn't there), and you support Israel? you are pro genocide."

You are aware that the Palestinian rejected three different offers of a two state solutions that Israel was willing to accept?
Only the dead have seen the end of war.
">And for Information of Bhakts Putin will support Palestine if required.

doesn't he already?"
"Okay, pro genocide."
">Israel is a coloniser so I will never support that.

They are not the colonisers. Jews are the original people of that land. They were driven out by the romans, who were taken over by the Islamists, who were colonized by the Britishers, who then allowed to go back to the original location to live with the palestines. Palestinians had a problem with the Jews.  So UN gave seperate country for Jews and muslims aka Israel and palestine.  Immediately after this, all the Muslim countries surrounding israel attacked israel and israel won. They got additional land in this process.


So if you are against colonizers, that would be the Palestine people and the israel people. 

The reason why I support israel is because, muslims are allowed to be in Israel, but Jews are not allowed to be in the pallestine region. It clearly shows the mentality."
">Israel created the monster known as Hamas because of years of exploitation. 

What you call exploitation is security measures from the surrounding Arab nations. I am with Israel on this. It was not israel who started attacking. It's the Arabs, who didn't want Jews among them.

>Now Hamas is striking back and Israel is playing the victim card. 

Because it was not the Israelis who fired 5000 rockets to the palestines.

>Neither side should be murdering civilians to demonstrate their point

Innocent civilians suffer due to the actions of their government. The innocent civilians should have handed the terrorist group to the Israelis when they hid guns and bombs under their shops. So how innocent are they?

>I think Israel government should be tried and executed in public court

They have been tried in the court of public opinion and looks like Hamas lost the case.


>Hamas government (after being punished for war crimes) should have a guarantee given to them about their citizen's lives and freedom from exploitation.

When Hamas will be punished, they would be dead. They wouldn't need any guarantees.

>Of course all this is only possible if the most powerful countries in the world interfere

Everyone is interfering and bringing punishment to the Hamas. Except for the Muslim countries ofc, who likes to see religion than who did what.

>seems like everyone already bought into Israel's victim card playing.

Not sure whether you would call every victim as victim card players, but yes I agree.

>So I have no hope for this situation.

And I have full hope for the situation, I am pretty sure that Israel Palestine conflict is going to be permanently resolved."
A lie. Israel pulled out of Gaza. This is what we got in return.
"As a human? ROFL... I guess you mean as a Islamist or a terrorist appologizer or left leaning intellectual.

There is no logical reason to support pallestine other than than the biased ones I heard from muslims (support pallestine because they are muslims). The left leaning intellectuals doesnt have any logical point to make, their strategy is to spread misinformation."
"Generally speaking, I don't think peace is possible. I love the concept of peace, but I don't think it's practical.

We can have long periods of peace but not everlasting peace. This is true because of limited resources, our insecurities, hatred towards people who doesn't have the same view as ours."
">they should have seperate and clear boundaries

And how exactly do you decide on those boundaries? What boundaries would both sides agree to? What happens to the millions of people living on the ""wrong"" side of the boundaries when those lines are drawn? Are they to be evicted from their homes again? How do you manage that without violence and bloodshed?"
"""Hamas"" is not Palestine. They're a despicable group of terrorists who deserve the absolute worst punishment. Palestine however also consists of countless men and women _and_ children who are starving because of this war."

Yes countless people who democratically elected the Hamas terrorists as their leaders in 2006 and these terrorists didn't leave power since. What a world am I right?"
"Same here, no biases. Feel very sad for all civilians hurt, especially children.

Overall, on a human level I cannot support Abrahamic ideologies because of how they ""other"" people who are not in their tribe (with a special hatred reserved for idol worshippers and pagans).  We are unfortunately seeing the violence perpetuated by these ideologies in real time."
"Yup. Judaism is no better tbh, after all, it is the source of the other two faiths:

""Judaism requires the elimination of idolatry from the world""

""Under Jewish law, an idolater would be subject to capital punishment""

Also, where Muslims have kaffir, Jews have ""gentiles"".

All whack jobs to be honest and more important to clarify, both ideologies demand Hindus (as polytheists, idol worshippers and pagans) are despised. 

When you begin to look into this stuff, you understand why the other religions similar to Hinduism were wiped out by the Abrahamics (ancient Greeks, ancient Egyptians, germanic paganism etc)."
"Yes, which make no sense. What sort of God would need me to do some weird ass stuff to grant me my wishes. Sounds like some sort of genie ü§£ 

It's weird but there's a lot of people that truly believe in these prophecies, to the point they would kill/die to fulfil them and summon ""judgement day"".

It isn't just geopolitics. This stuff is way, way deeper for them and kind of explains all the different players in the game - the Jews, the Muslims and the Christian West who are supposed to ""help"" the Jews to fulfil the prophecy. 

Will be interesting to see what happens now with Al Aqsa mosque as that is the location where the Jewish temple will need to be built according to their prophecy. That's definitely what Israel are aiming for but then it really will be world war 3."

And boom, you got a brand new religion. This is basically every abrahamic religion, in a nutshell. No doubt they are telling to kill people who dont follow them."
"Yeah, and the expansion started when Palestinians allied with arab nations to attack israel, that made israel scared. 

Arab nations have to win against israel only once, while israel has to win everytime, and thus they are scared, and when a very strong nations are scared, they stop caring. 


Also Isarel has a point, if they give Palestinians different nations they will attack the 1st chance they get (plastine+arab attack on israel), and if they form one nation well then arab nations/people have always turned blind to genocide of non-islamic religious people, and in a few decades they will repeat that. 


TL:DR Israel is scared of Palestine allying with arab nations, and now the cornered nation wants to make an example out of hamas"
Not true. Israel gave back most of the land it annexed (orders of magnitude more than what‚Äôs left) - in return Palestinian terrorism intensified.

"Lmao, imagine using expansion argument a week into the war. Smh, why do you love terrorists and their sympathisers so much?"
Israelis elected Netanyahu who has radical policies but doesn't go around raping and murdering children and civilians. Can you say the same about Hamas?
Not true. There is no equivalency between Israel doing what we can not to harm civilians and Hamas intentionally slaughtering civilians.
Israelis have not elected a terrorist organization whose written charter (google ‚ÄúHamas charter‚Äù) is to kill people from a certain ethnicity.
TikTok!? Seriously!? That‚Äôs your source of information!?

">You do know that Palestine is an open air prison?

Not sure what you mean by this. They can leave to Egypt or other countries whenever they want. Israelites afaik, just don't want them in Israel. If Egypt is not letting them in, that's not Israel's fault. 

>They have been taken up land from the Palestinians and displacing them.

Yes because palestine attacked israel and israel won that war along with alot of territory that the UN gave pallestines. If pallestines had won that war, the same would have happened to Israel.

>It was the Israel government which removed the Jews from that region so that they can blockade that area. 

It's Hamas who unofficially governs the Gaza strip, who doesn't want any jews into their territory. Israelis have check points and such. They allow restricted movement, such security is must for their self defense.

>Palestinians are not allowed to leave.

Not really sure from where you got this. Even after the attack the Palestinians wanted to go to Egypt and Egypt is the one who declined.

>You are misrepresenting the reality.Now explain the ""mentality"" that you speak of.

I don't think so, the mentality is still pretty clear to me. They have the same mentality of Pakistan. Kafirs are not worthy... Inshah Allah... Blah blah blah..."
‚ÄúPalestine is an open air prison‚Äù - simply not true
">The six day war was started by Israel. 

Nope it isn't that straight forward, Syria attacked israel first, then Egypt was joining in but before they could it went to standstill with American intervention. So Egypt instead of attacking went ahead and created blockades so that Israel couldn't trade. These tensions is what caused israel to not just wait for others to attack and decided to be on the offensive and initiate the 6 day war.

>Nothing gives them the right to drag people out of their own damn houses just because 10000 years ago their ancestors lived there.

They don't have the right to drag people out just because their ancestors lived there. But when in war, civilians will be hurt.  I assume you are talking about something that might have happened with civilians during this war when the Gaza strip was invaded.

Again I am saying, you cant just blame a country just for winning. Israel is basically surrounded by Muslim countries who simply don't want israel to exist. I am not going to condemn israel for wanting and fighting to exist. If they get additional territory during the process, it's the spoils of war."
">Israelis literally shoot down peaceful protesters on the streets in the name of protection.

Yh I don't trust how peaceful the peaceful community is going to be. Most probably the Hamas terrorists would be using civilians as shields and the return fire would have injured them. We used to see this tactic used in Kashmir. So that they can play the victim. 

>It was a group among Hamas who is doing the firing of rockets. Putting the blame on the entire country is stupid.

This is not a popular opinion. But yes that is my opinion. The whole issue was started by the country. Hamas is just a child of that mentality.

>Why tf would civilians trust the Israeli government who has done nothing but oppress them the entire time?

They shouldn't, just don't ask the isaelis to trust that they are innocent civilians either.  Because many of the ""innocent civilians"" actions are not so innocent towards the israelis.

>You are extremely misinformed about the situation and I suggest you do good research before picking the side the united states picks.

I disagree and I would also advise you the same."
Factually not true
"Fuck sake read up a bit. Hamas was elected in 2006 and there weren‚Äôt any elections held after that. So no Palestinians now didn‚Äôt vote them. Also Israel used Hamas to eradicate their opposition. In a way Israel actually funded Hamas. 

Hamas is a terrorist org, and not all Palestinians people support them. 

And the number of ‚ÄúIsraelis who‚Äôve died in the recent attack‚Äù is far less than the number of Palestinians dead. 

Palestinian people have been living under martial law / military rule in West Bank. 

The open air strip of GAZA is actually a fucking prison. 

Israel is bombing the whole Gaza Strip, there are no bomb shelters, there is no WATER, FOOD, ELECTRICITY. 

They can‚Äôt fucking go anywhere. 

The reason HAMAS is even here is due to the shit Israel did, killing Palestinians left and right. So

Fuck HAMAS, Fuck ISRAEL. I feel bad for the innocent civilians from Palestinian and as well as Israel who lost their lives due to this shit. I feel bad for all the people who have been killed doesn‚Äôt matter from which side."
Yes.This is a religious issue.Kuran is full of hate against Jews and Christians. Palestinians are doing what they are told to do in kuran.

"The conflict predates the attack on Israel.

According to an Ottoman survey, Jews constituted 5% of the population of Palestine in the mid 1800s.

Fundamentalist Jews envisioned a Jewish nation in Israel in the late 1800s. The idea was deemed moronic by most but gained traction due to the growing anti-semitism in Europe. 

Jews from Europe began migrating to the area in thousands and established an international fund to buy land from natives. At this point, Palestine followed a zamindar-like system which was disrupted by the Jewish immigrants -owing to their policy of employing only Jews which led to an increase in Arab unemployment. This is the start of the conflict as we know it.

Britain, which was administering the region, time and again put it‚Äôs own political interests above the welfare of the Palestinian people. In 1920s, the Passfield paper found that immigration had upset the economic stability of the region and should be curbed but they walked it back owing to political pressure from Jewish groups in Europe and America.

Immigration intensified in 1930s owing to persecution and illegal immigration (at 10x) the permitted began to take place. Violence from both groups was commonplace and many lives were lost. Jewish immigrants were able to consolidate their economic and political structures and flourished.

In 1940s, after WW2, Britain exited the region after multiple failed attempts at the 2-state policy because the promises they‚Äôd made to the Palestinians and those made to Jewish immigrants were irreconcilable. The US president, inspite of the findings of his government, pushed for unlimited immigration of Jews into Palestine. After this, Jews constituted roughly 1/3rd of the population. They were granted half the area in a proposed partition including the most fertile lands - Palestinians rejected the proposal and attacked along with other Arab neighbors. They lost and were driven from their homes. The rest is history.

The whole saga reeks of racism and imperialism, India suffered both at the hands of the British and that shaped our policy of support to Palestine. Even Gandhi said that immigration was incorrect and that Jews must return to their homes even if difficult."

Still they got blood on their hands so not supporting anyone.
Yes
"Not supporting either factions just a completely unbiased take here, but the Palestinians are still leaning towards extremists like Hamas, cus they've lost their faith from the moderate PA or PLO. The sole reason elections weren't held after 2006 is bcs the PLO is aware of the fact that they'll lose it, even Jordan and Egypt told the PLO not to hold any elections. In fact Israel themselves threatened PLO to prevent them from holding any elections."
Hamas hasn‚Äôt changed since the time they were elected. The Palestinians knew very well who they are voting for in 2006.
"Talking of reading up a bit,
Didn‚Äôt you read how BEFORE the elections, hamas had eliminating israel on its manifesto?

"I agree with you, while I can't verify most of the info you are sharing, it does match with what I have read/seen, but the point of fertile lands is actually wrong. 

Israel was given less fertile land sections of israel (thus their larger share  was justified by the British govt in this way.) But after the Israeli takeover they forcefully irrigated the land (through resources from more modern europe) and which led to this belief that the jewish were given more fertile land.

We have suffered the same, but now the point is that the israeli state cannot be removed from the map, jews will be there. 

But my point said above still holds true, which is  the Arab nations and independent Palestinian states have given very little confidence to Israelis that they will not butcher them (as history has shown they have done repeatedly)

And a scared nation can be convinced to do anything  

It's a cycle of  misery in which both israel and Palastine are stuck, not because of each other but because of the abhorrent Arab nations and the USA who never like to see this problem solved"
"Factually not true. Gaza, for instance, has not been occupied since 2005. That‚Äôs what mean by ‚Äúreturned‚Äù. There are many many more examples."
"My goodness. How messed up your moral compass must be if intentional civilian killings is being compared to collateral damage while targeting terrorists.
Hamas asked gazans not to evacuate
Hamas built their operating sites within public buildings and resident.
How must have a really big brain if you buy into- ooo palestinians are dying because of israel.
You‚Äôd have no narrative if israel did not invest in iron dome.
You‚Äôd have no narrative if israel did not invest in IDF and mossad.
Hamas‚Äô office in 2018 was under a hospital.
Hamas uses baby dolls in white shrouds and says- look our babies are dead
Palestinians view dead hamas members as martyrs and vice versa. Wake up and use your ‚Äòbig‚Äô brain"
The IDF did do some barbaric things like shooting civilians. I acknowledge that. But can you please provide source on where they raped and murdered children on this scale? Beheaded babies?
There is a difference between intentionally killing children and trying hard not to but failing because Hamas hide behind civilians.
Factually not true

It is perfectly fine not to have an opinion
are you trying to justify the murder of 600 children in the last 3 days done by Israel?
"Bro almost 50% of the Palestinian population right now  is under 18 / 20. So they were fucking born during that time. So these kids voted for the HAMAS when they were 3 correct. Go read some shit and stop falling for propaganda. 

Also Ukw, Israel is not some oh so innocent state, these motherfuckers did the same to the Arab / Palestinian population what the nazis did to them. 


This is GENOCIDE. This is ETHNIC CLEANSING. 


Also do you really believe that one of the best intelligence agencies like MOSSAD couldn‚Äôt see this attack coming? Especially after the fact that Egpt and US intelligence had informed them days prior about an attack from GAZA. Don‚Äôt you find it suspicious at all? Think about it"
Fuck off buddy
"Can‚Äôt you fucking read? 

I said FUCK HAMAS in BOLD. please get glasses or something if you can‚Äôt fucking see. 

HAMAS is a terrorist org who killed innocent civilians, but ISRAEL is no less, ISRAEL has been killing Palestinians-left and right since the last decade. 


When you keep targeting 1 community, take their land, kill their kids, have martial law / military rule in west bank. 

What do you expect, that these people will love you? All this led to what happened now. 

The only people I feel bad for are innocent kids both Israelis and Palestinian, who were murdered or worse. These innocent people had to lose their lives due to POS like HAMAS and NETANYAHU who only care about power and not about the people. These mfs will stay safely but it‚Äôs the innocent people who die. It‚Äôs the poor who die. It‚Äôs the civilians who die."

"It's not about choice . It's about fairness. In fact USA is the only country that has continuously waged wars since it's inception.

Palestinians are the natives who were brutally kicked out."
"I‚Äôll have to recheck the fertile lands bit, thanks for that but disagree on your assessment.

Israel is the occupier, to absolve them of fault and not acknowledge the devastation they inflicted on the native Palestinian population is to obfuscate history and modern Palestinian identity. There are people alive in Palestine who remember their homes which were taken from them.

Israel also terrorizes Palestinians frequently through settlements, random violence and deprivation of their rights, which begets your point about a scared populace - so long as Israel continues to subjugate Palestinians they‚Äôll resort to violence unless a Gandhi-like figure emerges among them. This violence has occurred in almost every occupied territory throughout the course of human history.

Hamas, US, UK, Iran and other Arab states are responsible for this crisis but the primary responsibility lies with Israel itself. It settled a populated country in modern times."
Im talking about Palestine
Bro u seen the news Gazas people can't even escape. Israel bombed all borders and they are basically trapped. Even bombed and killed people crossing Egypt border unallowing any kind of support from any country. Before you shout without proof give me some videos and links. Im ready to provide mine

"Cutting off electricity, water, meals while knowing that 40% of gaza is children, using white phosphorus on children's hospital, forcing huge population of civilians to evacuate, it's a humanitarian crisis. A war crime. 
Asking people to evacuate and when they do, b0mbing their trucks and cars. B0mbing the only exits, near the borders and airports. It's ethnic cleansing."
"Lol, you cringed at a clear video available on TikTok and you are pointing me to a subreddit post. How do come up with such responses bro"
What? No. I was just trying to refer to how the majority of civilians still prefer an extremist group.
"Kids cheered for hamas killing jews and parading hostages
They call them martys
These kids also participated in the attack. Yes, minors and 20 year olds did.
Didn‚Äôt need to vote to show their solidarity, just joining them did.
In case you don‚Äôt realise that hamas uses its own civilians as shields, their own women as factories to birth more jihadis, you need a wake up call."

"ROFL... Ofc yes, call islamphobia and not check the proof I provided. Glad that you don't wanna argue, would have lost some brain cells just by doing that."

USA waged wars in the name of religion?
"As I said I agree with most of the things you said, and what israel has been inflicting on Palestinians is abhorrent and crime against humanity. 

The terrorizing actions have escalated recently after Nitinyahu's government, while these actions have always been conducted by the israeli government they were never a major focus for them.

But lets take the example of a gaza strip, when a israel handed over gaza strip to Palestinian government, it was immediately take over by HAMAS (which we all can agree is a terrorist group), which had no inclination to work with israel for a peaceful solution (yes, I see the hypocrisy that after israeli occupation are Palestinians supposed to forget everything, but that's what it takes and that's how leaders are supposed to behave) so after HAMAS started controlling gaza they just attacked jews (be cognizant of what I am saying JEWS not israel), HAMAS came into power with the Idea of erasing jews from all of middle east and they started bombing israel, which in turn made israel lose all intrest towards welfare of west bank and further resolution of the conflict which has now rilled to what we see today.

As for the jew occupation part, both jews and Muslims used to live there even during Ottoman empire, but the British promised same peace of land to both ( there were no occupiers initially), which then escalated into militia fight jews and muslims in the area, and later the ENTIRE Arab world attacked The newly formed state of israel and as everbody know victors justice followed soon  (and as I said a scared nation will do anything to protect its people). because Arab nations only have to win once, while israel has to win everytime time (the stakes for israel are far bigger)

Now, let's see what I understand in the conflict and why HAMAS needs to be destroyed
1. Israel doesn't want to bomb residential buildings, but if they house weapons the choice becomes simple for them. 
2. What HAMAS did in this attack was way beyond what's acceptable ( something called moral ambiguity israeli might have done the same, but if they did it they tried to hide it. HAMAS didn't) and if you can't even pretend to follow the rules they there is essentially no difference between you and an animal 


Please understand thet what's happening to Palestinians is horrid and needs to stop, but HAMAS connot be allowed to exist anymore HAMAS has now become a tumor/Cancer of the modern world (Just like ISIS) 

AND i know that only even 1/3 of gaza strip actually supports HAMAS, but there is no other choice. 

I just hope peace returns to the area"
Gaza is not Palestine!?
"I hope you realise egypt controlled gaza before LOSING it in war against israel.
And if you don‚Äôt know that israel america and egypt are arranging a corridor, you need to read up more om how geopolitics work.

You can see the physical manifestation of hamas, but still succumbed to their mind games. It‚Äôs the hamas government‚Äôs responsibility to arrange for evacuation. They are instead prohibiting it to gain YOUR sympathy and increase anti semitism and it‚Äôs working."
Both sides have been doing that. Dropping bombs on each other.
True but Palestinians are not better either. Both sides have committed ugly things.
"Suggest an alternative solution, enlighten us."
Read the post. If you know nothing about that Reddit community (which is btw anything but pro Israel) read about it. Google the camp David accords. Study factual verified information.
"Bro it is true that Palestinian extremists (I will calm them extremists because they resort to violence) did not accept two state proposal ..... they started stone pelting, there were suicide bombings too. Now the issue is much more complicated than that and there were external actors involved too but some (not all ) plaestinians resorted to violence. And because of this some the others are also suffering."
wouldn't the same be said about Israel though? its an extremist government which has killed 600 children in the last 4 days. they're a democratically elected government funded by American tax payers and committing war crimes and ethnic cleansing with this money. how are you holding a militant group which is a product of occupation more accountable than a democratically elected government?
"You literally support genocide? Ethnic cleansing? What did you say, ""Israel is eliminating terrorists"", is that so? Then why are they b0mbing the evacuation vehicles that the civilians are using after they asked them to evacuate? Why are they b0mbing exits, leaving gaza citizens no where to go? Why are isr@elis killing Palestinians in the WEST BANK, where there is NO HAMAS ???"
"Bro fuck sake look at this. KIDS, LITERAL KIDS [DEAD ON THE ROAD](https://reddit.com/r/N_N_N/s/W1VHJ3VRiu)

Don‚Äôt watch it if you don‚Äôt have a strong stomach."
Fuck the Hamas and also fuck the people who support killing Muslims or any innocent human for that matter
"For corporate profits. Read about it. Most of the terrorists you see in the ME were once funded by the USA . TALIBAN for eg. Saddam Hussein was once a US ally. 

Do you think the USA is a very cute country that fights for freedom and democracy ? üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
"I do agree with you that Hamas needs to go, it‚Äôs the second biggest threat to the people of Palestine after Israel itself. But, as you mentioned, Israel has been subjugating Gaza and the west bank for decades now (some sources even suggest that it supported Hamas when PLO began too much to deal with - a theory which bears some weight because the US did the same thing in Afghanistan with Al-Qaeda) : after years of suppression with no end in sight, all you have to do is claim that you‚Äôll act tough against your enemy and you‚Äôll get all the votes. 

As I mentioned in my first comment, 5% Jews lived in the area in 1800s. The British decision to make a land for Jews was politically motivated. European Jews invaded a land over time, called it their own and exiled more than half a million Palestinians with US support. The land was most definitely occupied, a lot of Israelites have come forward and expressed horror at what they witnessed their country do at it‚Äôs inception.

Israel never had any interest in the welfare of the Palestinians, otherwise they wouldn‚Äôt be committing their continued crime against humanity. Israel also possesses the capability to hunt Hamas and save the captives using its intelligence agencies, being a recognized state it ought to not act responsibly but has instead chosen the route of disproportionate response in contravention of many international laws.

Israel definitely wants to punish civilians, it has been using White Phosphorus and bombing the area relentlessly. It has collectively punished the entirety of the Gazan refugees for the actions of a militant group. 

There is no such thing as pretending to follow rules, you either do or you don‚Äôt. Israeli politicians have openly been talking about flattening Gaza, they‚Äôve asked 1.1M people in an area devastated by their bombing campaign and repression to move to another area with no provisions for housing, food or anything else‚Ä¶

It baffles me that people recognize Hamas as a threat to middle-east peace but not Israel which has committed at least 100x atrocities. Most of the world is watching an ethnic cleansing with pom-poms in their hands or with quiet complicity."
The whole israel was supposed to be palestine
And you need to look into history of what they are doing to innocent people if you have sanity. Just research and you will find what the western media wont talk about
"The scale is much larger for what Israel did and has been doing. And I'm not saying this shit by pulling this randomly out of nowhere. There are articles about unprovoked attacks done by Israeli settlers. About Israelis committing horrible crimes despite white flags being raised. So yeah, i am still all for Palestinian cause. But fuck Hamas though, and fuck Israel."
"Whatever the solution is, it's definitely not ethnic cleansing, which is what Israel is doing right now."
"I will read the post, have you watched the short video though?"
When in any of my comments did I deny Israel the atrocities it has committed? The Israeli civilians are no good either cus no wonder Netanyahu is still in power despite his extremist policies.
"Propaganda. And IF the IDF is bombing a vehicle, it must have hamas people in it"
Awww little jihadis can't write a single sentence without doing monkey balancing.
"Sure not. Everybody thinks about their own benefits first and so should we as well. They funded terrorist organizations for their own benefits, but they also destroyed terrorist organizations when terrorists targeted them. I dont think any of these events has religion involved. On the other hand, terrorist organizations, are made for a religion at first. 

So after knowing all of these you expect people to be kind towards terrorist organizations? Lol."
"First I'll like to say thank you for having this kind of civilized discussion, I can't tell you how I learn from it and how much I appreciate it! 

1st is about the votes part, HAMAS actually did not get even 50% of the vote, but because of how the election system in palastine is set up they got the win in elections. The situation of israel supporting hamas might have been true initially but the support would've dried out after HAMAS's first charter came out (where I think mossad fucked up, because HAMAS went out of their control) 

The point of 5-10% jews is partially correct (plus don't take these census at face value as they were conducted during colonial rule or Ottomans rule and they didn't care about minorities in their country), but if you only include the current israeli-palestinian area, yes a lot of jews migrated from europe but a lot of them also came from the arab world due to discrimination and genocide they faced there. 

The Exiled part for palestinian is always blown out of context, they were not ""exiled"" like kashmiri pandits (giving this example because you will know more about being an indian, i guess?) They had to escape because a war, in which by some miracle israel won and as they say Victor's justice (there is not right or wrong in here) followed soon, land annexation, reparations etc. which resulted in more occupied land than anticipated ( and israel wanted defense in depth so they just kept the land)

Unlike the out of proportion news you hear about mossad, the rescue of israeli civilians is very hard and will most likely result not only in multiple deaths on the part of IDF but also receive no local support for their actions at all which makes it all the more harder (the civilians are in gaza strip, not west bank).

The use of white phosphorus like substance ( they were never able to verify if it was white phosphorus because nobody got the burns or any source verifying it), so it might have been something else.

 But yes israel doesn't care about the minorities in its country which is not new for states in the middle east (syria, iran, iraq, jordan egypt etc.) Unlike the more structured societies in the west or the east (though both have their own style of discrimination, which is less severe than the one in the middle east) they don't care about minorities, but also actively work against them which include kidnapping, forcefully converting, levying extra taxes etc. 

If you go by the word of the law, israel didn't even need to give the warning (non-uniformed irregular combatants, using civilian as meat shields) and humanitarian aid is technically not israel's business ( countries that attack normally do that to have a good PR image). Again if they wanted to level gaza they could've just carpet bombed the entire region but they have been targeting specific locations and writing off the civilians as collateral damage (which is a disgusting technique both sides are using).

And the last part is wrong, even syria is a more destabilizing agent than israel in the Middle East ( it all depends on who you ask for middle east itself they might say israel but it's not like it's all flowers and chocolates between the arab states themselves) Plus israel works as a launch pad for evey nation of destroy anything they don't want in middle east (nuclear weapons, ISIS, independent oil, etc.). 

Nobody cares about the atrocities, when kashmiri pandits were killed did anybody make a noise? NO, when jews and other minorites were getting forcefully raped/converted in middle east anybody say anything? NO 
They did it under the guise of following the rules ( a positive PR image) and HAMAS has led israel to do more damage to gaza than israel ever wanted too.

My point is we can't judge the Middle East by our standards because it's a place where they have a decadent amount of money or they are a state where genocides/civil wars/massacres are commonplace which stopped only recently and israel and saudi arabia are at the forefront to stop that (ironically both if them are not stopping it inside of their own country) 

>Most of the world is watching an ethnic cleansing with pom-poms in their hands or with quiet complicity.

They don't have any other choice and there are more serious matters at hand for the big players (USA vs China, Russia vs Ukraine, the  India game etc.) And israel is almost everyone's big military partner which includes china, russia, india, USA even fucking japan (China has it's own genocide going own, America's last genocide was like 30 years ago, india is a mess where everyone is burning everything, japan has an unofficial policy of not giving muslims citizenship ) so nobody wants to throw stones when their own houses are made of glass 

Sorry to break your bubble brother, but palestinian are not important enough for the western or eastern world to fight against israel, and the arab world is in the situation of pot calling kettle black (basically the arab nation commits worse genocides slowly and in a more sophisticated manner, and the only reason they are screaming now is because the victims are Muslims) ( IK the last line seems islamophobic, but sadly it's the truth) 

I just hope that one way or the other peace returns


P.S Don't trust any news from Al Jazeera, they present news in such a way that it's almost lying (in one section they just said, and I am paraphrasing ""the exile of kashmiri pandits was part of the plan for resistance against India and actions of freedom fighters"") al Jazeera has a habit of justifying any atrocity commited by islamic extremist organisations."
Here we go. Just say it out load that you  think the Jews don‚Äôt deserve a country in their homeland.
How .There is no nation callwd Palestine ever.Its just a place.But Israel nation was there.
"Innocent people ,my foot.People of Gaza elected this terrorist Hamas.Even  if Palestine is formed as a free nation,muslims will not stop fighting Jews because of the verses in Kuran portraying Jews and Christians as enemies .That is the reason why Muslims all over the world are supporting Hamas terrorists. Beacuse they are doing something which is required to be done by Muslims as per kuran.

Sahih al Bukhari 2926
Book 56,Hadith 139.

This is not a geo political issue.The root of this conflict lies in kuran and the hate in kuran against jews . But the Islamists hide this religious angle and make it a geo political problem."
"Just a completely unbiased take here.

Yes what Israel is doing is dirty and fuck them. 

But the PLO and the civilians themselves have shot themselves in the foot multiple times in the past. When the Israeli-Palestine two states were formed. The stupid muslims couldn't take up the shit that the entire land wasn't theirs and their religion literally promotes unprovoked violence towards the Jews. Hence they sided with other Arab nations and scared Israel ever since making them change their policies. It was the Palestinians who started this shit. Then they rejected the Two-State Solution THRICE. And when they did accept it in Oslo Accords, the extremist civilians couldn't digest the shit that they'll have to co-exist with a Jewish State and hence they formed and elected Hamas. The PLO themselves are no angels either, before Hamas existed they used to commit suicide bombings and terrorist attacks in Israel, they're considered moderate now cus they've been weakened by Netanyahu and Hamas is just much worse than them. And the civilians of Palestine in the present era are still STUPID cus they still promote extremism and Hamas and if you think I made this source up? Just check out why no elections have been held since 2006 the PLO was shit scared that they'll be overthrown, Jordan and Egypt warned them not to hold elections either and ISRAEL threatened the PLO from holding elections cus they don't want Hamas to control the west bank as well.

Once again I'm completely neutral here, just stated the past. 

The Palestinians including their pro-Muslim civilians who couldn't take up two states existing started this war and now the Israelis are ending it. That's what happens when you ""Fuck around and find out."""
Tell these lies about that ‚Äúethnic cleansing‚Äù to Israeli Arabs who have all the freedoms one can think of and way more than they would have had in areas controlled by the Palestinians.
"Lol I bet he didn't ü§£
Left leaning intellectuals don't want information. They want echo chambers."
you don't support either faction. not taking sides is taking the side of the oppressor. Israel was formed by ethnically cleansing the local Palestinian population. Palestinians are told that their lives don't matter as they're massacred for years. Netanyahu wasn't the only Israeli leader who committed war crimes. Palestinians haven't elected Hamas since 2006 - that's 17 years. 40-50% of Palestine population wasn't even born that time. it doesn't matter why the elections aren't taking place. the truth is that there has been no election and the Palestinian people are at the mercy of a government and people who btw chant death to Arabs at their rallies. and who vote for the leaders who will keep the status quo of keeping the Arab population subjugated.
"Source about what you said : trust me bro, i know IDF people, very nice people, love them so much.

Source about what I said : literally civilians' video showing how it was a truck full of kids and women all taking their bags so that they can evacuate homes, and they all are just shattered after a few seconds."

">On the other hand, terrorist organizations, are made for a religion at first.

Lol. Not true..they are well funded criminal syndicates for profit.

>So after knowing all of these you expect people to be kind towards terrorist organizations? Lol.

I never said that. Probably you support terrorism if it's non-religious in character."
"Um, Hamas won with 44% of the vote and at that time, from what I know, they contested claiming they‚Äôd be peaceful but had a sordid past. Currently, atrocities are being justified against Palestinians because elected Hamas. This is such a lose-lose for Palestinians, though is it not? Israel props up Hamas over PLO/PA and then justifies atrocities citing support for Hamas. 

I couldn‚Äôt find a single source that disputes the 5-10% figures, even the most favorable sources for Israelis count their proportion at 11% in 1900s. Arab Jews migrated to Israel after the events of the 1960s. Most of the immigrants were European colonizers though, long after Israel had already carved itself out of Palestine.

About the exile of the Palestinians, I vehemently disagree. They were displaced exactly like Kashmiri Pandits, Gujrati Muslims or any group fleeing persecution during the 1947 partition - they‚Äôd to leave or face wholesale slaughter. Israeli forces went village to village and cleared it for themselves. A movie was released in the last few years detailing a Palestinian account which Israel protested aggressively and labelled antisemitic but is a pretty powerful watch.

Strongly disagree with you about victors‚Äô justice, it is definitely wrong by every moral standard. It was wrong when Hitler invaded Poland, prevailed and  began enacting his ‚Äòfinal solution‚Äô for the Jewish community and it was wrong when Israelis drove the Palestinians from their homes on the strength of the arms with support of the US and the UK owing to ideological and racial similarities. Were there reparations? None that I know of but that is the need of the hour - a two state solution with land and monetary reparations to the people of Palestine and an acknowledgement of all the injustices inflicted on them.

Yes, it‚Äôll put the IDF at risk but that is what a responsible state is supposed to do. Israel and their allies have made clear however that Israeli lives are much more valuable than Palestinian lives. Once it starts not treating people like they are animals, perhaps it‚Äôll start getting some local support. It holds all the cards and has to make the first concession.

HRW and Amnesty international have both verified the WAFA news video relating to white phosphorus. Doctors have stated they‚Äôve seen some injuries which may be attributed to the substance. Israel has used the substance earlier in Gaza as well, validated by a different UN agency.

Israel is actually required to preserve civilian life, it has purposefully not signed the required charters so that it might not be subject to the war crimes investigations. It‚Äôs supreme court has stated that Israel law can supersede international law or something to that effect. There are so many videos and stories, all verified by international media, where it is clear that no warning was given to the civilians, IDF bulldozing a school while students barely escape, shooting missiles at kids on a beach and claiming a naval facility when international reporters find nothing, blowing up UN schools which are the only places of safe refuge for Palestinians, settlers shooting a young Palestinian kid playing football and many more. 

Not a destabilizing agent, but a threat to peace in the middle east which is Israel. Israel has made itself indispensable through ingenuity and gaining significant political influence in US/UK and can do with Palestinians as it pleases as long as it doesn‚Äôt offend too many people.
Israel supported Hamas because RW, Likud and worse, doesn‚Äôt want a separate Palestinian state. One could argue that without US and Israel, the middle-east would be much more peaceful than it is today. If not for US overthrowing Iran‚Äôs Mosadeq who knows where we‚Äôd be today. 

Again, this idea that Israel can punish Gaza for Hamas is hypocritical and in clear contravention of international law. Makes Israel a terrorist nation, Hamas also claims it was punishing Israel for the people it has killed.

We judge Hamas by our standards and give a free-pass to Israel. 

Arab nations/Muslims have been demonized in the western world by the ‚Äòwar on terror‚Äô which is why when RW insult left intellectuals they claim they are soft on Islam. I know that western governments don‚Äôt care about Palestine or her people, they aren‚Äôt white or rich.

Arab nations have been embroiled in conflict after conflict, they usually shout at each other and the world doesn‚Äôt bother because Arabs killing Arabs and arabs are cheap. They‚Äôre also not subtle, I don‚Äôt know what you mean by sophisticated. They‚Äôve not been doing anything to help Palestine btw, apart from the odd statement here or there. If not for those odd statements, there‚Äôd be no advocate for Palestinians though so good on them I suppose. Islamophobic, yes - possibly.

Israel is committing the most sophisticated genocide of all time, they‚Äôve influenced international law to their advantage!

I‚Äôd look at Al-Jazeera but verify whatever they present with a grain of salt and try to find a few other ‚Äògood‚Äô sources for news that catches my interest. Israeli/US/European news very rarely capture anything from the Arab perspective and very rarely run any news critical of Israel when you yourself know that Israel commits war crimes on the regular."
If that's the case then the british were right about India. Maybe they should have taken full control of India and Continued to do so
Just so you know there are many Jews living in Palestine and Gaza and they are all being killed. Even Christians
Man are you seriously acting like your dumb or your actually dumb
What about Israel? You talk as if they are really good. Grow some brain cells and stop being racist and show some humanity.
"You do know that Hamas was created by isr@el right? And you do know that in the two state solution, most of the fertile land was being given away to isr@el right? Rightfully, it enraged the natives. As well as the fact that, in the Oslo Accords proposal, Palestine wasn't even declared an independent sovereign state. 60% of Israelis across the political spectrum also opposed a two-state solution.

>before Hamas existed they used to commit suicide bombings and terrorist attacks in Israel, 

If we are to take this path, then here's something for you.
""In 1994, during the overlap of the Jewish festival of Purim and the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, Jewish extremist Baruch Goldstein opened fire on Muslim worshippers in the Sanctuary of Abraham above the Cave of Machpelah (also called the Tomb of the Patriarchs) in Hebron, a holy site frequented by both Jews and Muslims.""

>their religion literally promotes unprovoked violence towards the Jews.

I agree that radical muslims follow this, but it's not true to generalize. When Jewish were kicked out of European countries, Palestinians accepted them as refugees."
"Lies about ethnic cleansing when isr@elis are carpet b0mbing without letting civilians escape, and those who do, they b0mb them as well. How come you are literally ignoring all this tf? The president of isr@el says that there's no 'innocent civilian' in Gaza and wants to completely eradicate all of them. What the fuck is wrong with you for still defending them? And again, Palestine is NOT EQUAL to Hamas. When Jewish were kicked out of European countries, Palestinians took them as refugees.
Oh and in case you had no idea, Hamas was created by Isr@el."
"> you don't support either faction. not taking sides is taking the side of the oppressor. 

Now where did this come from? I am just aware of the history and the present, but I really don't care about either of them. 

> Netanyahu wasn't the only Israeli leader who committed war crimes. 

True, what I meant simply was that Netanyahu is more extremist than the previous Israeli leaders.

> Palestinians haven't elected Hamas since 2006 - that's 17 years. 40-50% of Palestine population wasn't even born that time. it doesn't matter why the elections aren't taking place. 

Then what is the justification behind the PLO suddenly halting the recent elections? You can look out at different sources, everyone was aware that Hamas had the majority of support, even Netanyahu threatened the PLO from holding elections."
"My trust is still a better source than your terrorist funded facebook pages and al jazeera.

This is like saying, earth is flat lmao. They are grouped in the name of religion. I dont even call abrahamic religions ,religion. Its basically teaching of some guy and their mad followers, more like today's babas. Both Judaism, and Islam hates idol worshippers. What more needed to know? Yes other Muslims want to hide their true intentions by saying, they are not grouped for Islam. I can't help them."
Jews living in Gaza!? You are on serious drugs man.
Why.U don't like the religious angle exposed.Time is up for Islamist propaganda.
"Ha.No humanity against child killers and rapists.Jewish Fund bought the land  of their forefathers with money during  the time of Ottoman empire.Its not like dacoit Momo and the later Khaleefas who plundered other nations ,raped women and killed children just like Hamas did last Saturday.I am not asking U to grow some brain cells,because u can't grow something which is not there."
"Yes I know that Hamas was created by Israel. But who started the Israeli Arab War and the Six Day War?

""In 1994, during the overlap of the Jewish festival of Purim and the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, Jewish extremist Baruch Goldstein opened fire on Muslim worshippers in the Sanctuary of Abraham above the Cave of Machpelah (also called the Tomb of the Patriarchs) in Hebron, a holy site frequented by both Jews and Muslims.""

No offense but this is such a bullshit argument against me cause I'm already aware that Israel is no good either and has committed much worse atrocities.

> I agree that radical muslims follow this, but it's not true to generalize. When Jewish were kicked out of European countries, Palestinians accepted them as refugees.

Well that was the past, currently the majority of them are radical muslims. Even the Jews are radical af cus no wonder Netanyahu is still in power, his extremist policies are why ppl like him."
">Oh and in case you had no idea, Hamas was created by Isr@el.

Chuslim conspiracy theories. üòÇ

>The president of isr@el says that there's no 'innocent civilian' in Gaza and wants to completely eradicate all of them. What the fuck is wrong with you for still defending them? And again, Palestine is NOT EQUAL to Hamas.

We will defend Israeli Coz the supported us when Pakistan attacked India. The Palestinians are jihadhists terrorist of Jordanian origin who supported Pakistan against India.

I don't know why you and Indian Chuslims are concerned about Palestines. If the Indian Chuslims create mischief in India then Indian Chuslims shall face the same consequences as Palestinians."
If Israel was carpet bombing there would be no Gaza. You are a lier.
"What is your source then? Western propaganda media? Take that shit up your ass and stfu, pro genocide."
">say, you support terrorism if its religious in character

I support none..what US does in ME is terrorism too."
Oh dang look who came and checked all peoples religion on Gaza. Cant believe it damn bro. You must be genius. Maybe you asked every 2.1 million people
Tf u bringing religion here. Talk about people. Cant believe this generation has become soo racist they want to eradicate people based on their belief. You no worse than a terrorist you talk about
">Indian Chuslims shall face the same consequences as Palestinians

You do know that you are very openly supporting genocide against Indian muslims, right? Since Palestinians are literally going through a genocide right now, even if not full scale.

>Chuslim conspiracy theories

Buddy, if you have zero idea about history, then don't come here to bark. Go do some research or go study. I have nothing else to say, goodbye."
"Ok hence proved.
All jazeera supporter, jihad supporter, anti semite."
"Palestines supported crimes of Pakistan against India. Therefore there is no reason to be concerned about Palestines as a person living in India. The Palestinians are jihadhists who hate India and they are facing concequences of their actions for being Jihadhis.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/report-hamas-preventing-gazans-from-evacuating-homes-after-idf-warning-of-impending-strike/
You are a lunatic
"Why.Its only religion at play here..Have u read the covenant of Hamas.Preamble says ' Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam obliterate it,just as it obliterated others before it '.Who are u to question the intention of Hamas when they themselves say this issue is a religious issue.Buy some Burnol bro.This is r/India sub.India always suported the cause of Palestine from the time of Nehru in UN,but wht did Palestine do in return.They always stood with our enemy nation Pakistan in UN.U r vomiting Islamist propaganda  here.Islam is not a race.It is a religion which has many races.Cry all u want,Gaza will be a deser soon."
">You do know that you are very openly supporting genocide against Indian muslims, right?

If the Indian Chuslims don't stop behaving like chimps then we have to make sure that Indian Chuslims face the same consequences as Palestinians.

Indian Chuslims partitioned the country and waged war against India. That itself is a good reason to make Indian Chuslims face the same consequences as Palestinians.

>Buddy, if you have zero idea about history, then don't come here to bark. Go do some research or go study.

You listen to idiots like Medhi Hassan and telling me to do research. Lmao!

Hamas has its roots in Muslim brotherhood of Palestinian branch. It was a result of Islamic teachings."
Nowhere did I say that i support Hamas/ the idea of anti Semitism. But go off troll.
"You literally did not provide the source for what I was asking. Source about the fact that the vehicle which they b0mbed had ""ham@s"" members in it. 
And as I said, those who evacuated, got killed."
And your Delusional
You only started talking about hamas until a week ago when he fighted back. Even long before this event israel has been killing many Kids and innocent people. Where were u at that time. Seems like your motive to support israel is just based upon hating muslim community. Maybe its you who is the problems filled with hatred. Maybe once in a while open your eyes
Hamas sacrificing their civilians is genocide to you. While killing babies in the only jewish state on earth with the ACTUAL INTENTION OF GENOCIDE is not genocide to you. Hamas manifesto and quran asks for jewish genocide but sure- collateral damage in war in a densely populated terrorist regime is genocide. Shame on you
"Yeah,its Israel who attacked music festival and shot at people randomly.And killed children and raped women.8srael is giving notice to terrorist supporting people of Gaza to vacate before they start their operation.What did Hamas do.They attcked men ,women and children without notice..Its written in ur Holy book to hate people of other religion and now u r saying I am the hater.Bro Hamas will be wiped out .You can white wash ur religion of hate all u want ."
"You talk as if isr@elis didn't want to mass murder Palestinians? The president literally says that he wants to eradicate them completely, he says there are no ""innocent"" civilians. THAT IS NOT A GENOCIDE TO YOU???? And this war has been going on for 70+ years, with isr@el being the more powerful one. Occupying the lands and homes of Palestinians, which is colonizing. And again, HAMAS IS NOT EQUAL TO PALESTINE THE FUCK???"
U know Israel killed more than babies today. Yeah before you look into it before this festival even started. Israel has been killing thousands heck check something research for some shit. There are conflicts on both sides and I don't support Hamas methods or Israel's. But the things israel been doing for years dosent justify hating on palestine now. They have done worse and the sad thing is its not reported on media
Now u r not supporting Hamas lol.I support Israel .Gaza will be a desert soon.
I support Palestine against those cruel Israel killing for fun
ü§£
Yes
"Hamas is a terrorist org, and should be called as such. India should also maintain their position that Palestine should become a sovereign state which can sustain itself."
"Yes. Millitaries don't kidnap civilians, women and children and attack them. They fight only the soldiers. They don't parade naked women on roads and rape tourists."
Yes absolutely.
Yes definitely...but Palestine should be protected as well. It isn't the fault of the citizens but Hamas and the messed up Israeli govt that has lead to this war.
Yes.
"Not a question of ""should"" . India has to decide the right time or ""when""."
100%
"I see a lot of people here equating IDF to Hamas. They‚Äôre not equal. IDF is the military of a sovereign state recognised by UN, Hamas is an unrecognised paramilitary wing. 

By this logic, India as a state wouldn‚Äôt have any right to kill LeT pigs. But if you think India was wrong to combat terrorism on its own soil then of course please go ahead and support Hamas. I just wish Hamas‚Äôs supporter‚Äôs kids also get abducted and held as hostages."
In a heartbeat!
"Did Israel did same with Pakistani terror orgs.? If yes then there should be some possibility of designating Hamas, if No then why should we care."
Yes but I'm not sure if it will change anything.
Yes.
"Absolutely against hamas . People should stop thinking hamas = palestine. NO ! Palestine should be saved ,for continuous 30 days children, adult and animals are losing their life."
"Yes, without a doubt.

As a country which considers itself a proponent of Gandhian ideals, it‚Äôs a no brainier really.

One doesn‚Äôt even need to justify it tbf"
Calling Hamas a terrorist organization for fighting against an apartheid state is retarded.
And Israel a terrorist state?
Wait.. No. It is their fight and they should sort it out. No reason simping over Israel. Remember what that Israeli movie director Navad Lapid said about Kashmir files. Let them get a taste. We must focus on purchasing cheap oil from Russia and Arab countries if shit hits the fan. They are Abrahamic religion and they will support their own kind when one of them is rioting against any Eastern religion like ours or Buddhism.
Yes
Yes
Yes
"Seems like an unpopular opinion in this thread, but I think India should refrain from taking sides. Neither Israelis nor Palestinians give a damn about us, so why should we?"
"Absolutely, like how Bhagat Singh was for the British occupiers."
"No. We need to stay out of it not our business and not our conflict.

The word terrorist is a little too randomly thrown around these days and has lost its meaning.

It's baffling how our people blindly lap up western conservative talking points like braindead sheep."
"No. I'm never going to be against militants who fight for freedom of their land because we literally have a history of doing the same thing.

Not supporting Hamas would be hypocrisy."
"Both Hamas and Israeli Govt/IDF should be officially declared as terrorist organizations, and should be stopped from killing further innocent lives and both of this terror organization members involved in the genocide and their leaders should be thrown into prison for life on charges of genocide and war crimes."
India should start by voting in favour of Israel in UN resolutions rather than abstaining.
"No. Israel is a western ally and the West plays double  game.. They turn blind eye to our security concerns. There is no reason for India to designate Hamas as terrorists. Why should we do something that will spoil our relationship with Middle East with no return?

Wait till the Indian workers that Israel requested reaches it shores and starts working there. They way Israelis treat nonwhites, we will start seeing news of mistreatment of Indians there. I love to see the proisraeli posters then."
"No, would you call a freedom fighter such as Bhagat Singh a terrorist? The west does. I don't put much faith in the west neither should you."
"There is no doubt that Hamas is and should be official designated a terrorist organization by India. Additionally, Israel is one of the greatest countries in the world and has the potential to be our closest ally in the future."
"no, absolutely not. my country earned its independence from imperialist bastards through bloody, violent revolution. millions died so the rest of us could live. indian freedom fighters were dehumanised by the brits. they were called animals and terrorists. my country was the first non-arab country to recognise palestine, seeing it as a fellow oppressed nation.

i'm not going to support my country abandoning its ideals and bending over backwards to please a bunch of genocidal fascists (a glorified military outpost created by brits and americans) currently carrying out ethnic cleansing. the genocidal fascists who are calling palestinians those same insults which brits called my people. hamas' islamic fundamentalism can be dealt with later. israel propped hamas up to weaken the PLO. they made their bed, so now they can sleep in it. as long as hamas is the only group putting up a resistance against the zionist occupiers, they do not have my condemnation.

if you want to abandon your integrity and weasel up to the side of people who see you as subhuman pagans going all ""phull sappot saar"" then by all means, do it.

bring on the downvotes."
"Even the west considers the Taliban as an extremist/terrorist organisation even when they had the claim and sole representation of a sovereign state.

With Palestinian Authority not able to *control* Gaza and leaving it to the mercy of Fatah/Hamas/PIJ, just like the Taliban, they too are the other representatives of people there, even if they involve in extremist activities or act like a paramilitary."
"I don't think so, and that's mostly because Hamas isn‚Äôt an organisation like Al Qaeda or ISIS who will bomb civilians all over the world. Instead they will focus their efforts on Israel-Palestine, so it doesn‚Äôt really affect India at all."
Bhai soch liya kar puchne se pehle. Hamas has no active or inactive presence in india hence it can not designate it as a terrorist organisation.
"Hamas is a terrorist organisation but these scums were elected to government by the people of gaza, so the people of gaza are equally responsible for all the horrific shit hamas has done. Therefore declaration of Hamas as terrorist is holding gazans accountable which is currently opposite to the world's narrative 

Also Hamas has back door financial funding of iran, turkey, Egypt, or probably 50 other crazy jihadi countries of middle east.

Also declaration of a organisation as terrorist comes under ministry of home affairs which is only for internal security."
Only the military wing
"Britsh occupied many countries in the world, looted it, created divisions, but that wasn't the case with Palestine and its people, they created a new settlement in the middle of Palestine which would later on swallow it whole... to accept there shouldn't be any reaction on Israel's actions that they are doing for years is like .. practically not possible to think of. One does not forget years of atrocities... not just gaza strip... even in the west bank!

Which organization should be considered terrorist? its not a simple question either black or white.
i am against hamas and idf ... i am against the people who kill innocent life and that innocent little childrens who doesn't know whats going on."
It doesn‚Äôt really matter. I feel india is navigating this situation correctly.
"Designating Hamas as a terrorist organisation does nothing as far as India is concerned to be fair. It's more of a media and political move. Hamas isn't operational in India at all and usually only organisations operating on Indian soil on some level would be designated as a terror group. 


If India chooses to do so, I would fully support it. At the same time I understand why they haven't done it yet because it's a pointless PR move and almost seems like petty politics in between a very mature and well managed MEA operation."
"looking at the other comments, it's quite likely that ill get downvoted to hell but Hamas is much, much closer to a resistance movement than a terrorist organisation. 

in either case, Hamas has been turned as the center of attention in this conflict, when in fact it's Israel that should be the center of attention bcos of their disproportionate genocide against the Palestinians. if not post 7/10, then pre. the 75 year oppression isnt a mere footnote in this conflict. its not an additional fact. it speaks volumes of Israel's intents.

üáµüá∏üáµüá∏üáµüá∏"
"Hamas has good connections with congress party right from 1980's ..rajiv gandhi time ...

and anti hindu congress party ...minorities sucker...will be in advantage like they had in karnataka elections this year...

just like other issues where bjp was silent ...this would be the same....

vote bank politics...."
this question should have been in r/ Indiageopolitics
Yes
"Yes, because of extreme opinions."
"This is going to be very unpopular. 

Does not affect India, we should stay out of it. Let us not stick our noses into other people's business."
Yes broüëç
Why
Only right answer
">Millitaries don't kidnap civilians, women and children and attack them. They fight only the soldiers.

I have a bridge I want to sell you. Everything a terrorist has done, military has done worse."
üëÜ
Those who think that would also feel LeT are correct. You know who exactly they are
">By this logic, India as a state wouldn‚Äôt have any right to kill LeT pigs. But if you think India was wrong to combat terrorism on its own soil

Well if we go bomb Pakistani civilians and start sniping kids playing football or having contest about how many civilian knees we can blow up then yea even Indian army would be called terrorists."
NOOOO YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WE ISRAELIS NEED TO BOMB HOSPITALS AND KILL KIDS BRO TRUST ME BRO WE NEED TO SEGREGATE SOCIETY BASED ON IF YOU'RE ARAB OR JEWISH BRO TRUST ME BRO IT'S NOT APARTHEID BRO WE NEED TO TAKE THEIR HOMES BRO
"it's the way you know nothing, Hamas are the youngsters whose parents were killed by IDF, they were little kids when they made orphans but sure all your sympathy lies with colonisers"
">They‚Äôre not equal. IDF is the military of a sovereign state recognised by UN, Hamas is an unrecognised paramilitary wing.

So the difference between IDF and Hamas is the recognition it has received from powers (Western primarily). Not the number of civilians killed and lands looted, because IDF is 10X worse than Hamas on those parameters."
"Some people here on this thread say otherwise , what explains this"
"You think India should make a deal, not just help for no reason"
A lot of people actually support Hamas. Read the thread
You support killing babies?
No major news organisation says so
"Not simping is fine but Navad Lapid is a bad example as he is their Rana Ayub. 

The Israeli Ambassado came in our support after that episode."
You think India should stay out of it
He didn‚Äôt kill innocents
"This has to be the most retarded opinion I have read. Bhagat Singh wanted to kill James Scott for his illegal lathi charge that led to Lala Lajpat Rai's death. Due to a case of mistaken identity he ended up killing Saunders.

According to your point Scott/Saunders are innocent according to British sure. But in the eyes of Bhagat Singh, they were part of the British administration subjugating India. Bhagat Singh didn't kill any innocent British CIVILIAN living in India (who is not part of the British administration)! He killed someone who was part of the administration/Police.

Hamas wouldn't be called a terrorist org if they killed someone from IDF or an Israeli police officer or heck even a politician or someone from Mossad etc. But they KILLED INNOCENT FAMILIES just because they are Israeli/Jewish.

Imagine if Bhagat Singh went and killed the first British person he saw on the road who has nothing to do with British Governance in India and is just a relative/friend of the British and just happens to be of the same race and nationality then yes Bhagat Singh would also be a terrorist because he killed an innocent civilian who has nothing to do with administration/politics/policies.

Lets not even start on the fact that Hamas has killed not only innocent men but also innocent women and children and raped them too."
The only sane comment its none of our business we must maintain trade relations with both arabs and Israel and don't forget some years earlier taliban was also a terrorist organisation and now its a legit state and truth is its a western and middle east business and absolutely nothing to do with us
They kidnap and kill innocent civilians - both Palestinian and Israeli. They could not be farther from our freedom fighters. What are you talking about?
Based.
Abstaining is tacit support in diplomacy.
For goodwill
Bhagat Singh ne er raped British women and beheaded British children you absolute disgrace. He threw fake bombs and gave his life so lil shits like you could speak garbage
"One of the greatest countries? Israel? Not by a long shot. One of our closest allies? Maybe, maybe not."
zip it up when you're done
Huh???
the glazing is crazy üò≠ bro they HATE indians üò≠ üò≠ üò≠
What you're essentially saying is that Israel should cede control of Gaza to Hamas. I lean pro-Palestine on this issue overall but fuck that shit. Two state solution is the way to go.
We do support Palestinian rights and condemn the actions of Israel ever since it's creation. But we don't support terrorism. Indian freedom fighters didn't actively kill civilians like Hamas do.
Brain dead take. Indian revolutionaries never killed British children and raped British women.
What's your opinion on Kashmir independence and hijbul Mujahideen
"I'm from Kerala where a lot of people have Qatari connections (including me, I have around half a dozen relatives in Doha) and Hamas do have some connections to Kerala via Qatar. This is how Hamas leader Khaled Mashal was able to speak in Kerala last week. So it's not something that we can sweep under the rug. Indian government blacklisting Hamas would delegit these radicals. 

On a general note, absent geopolitical morality, we should condemn fundie terrorism everywhere. Hamas is absolutely a fundie terrorist organization"
Check recent news
"The people of America voted for Bush who did a lot of horrific stuff in Afghanistan and Iraq, do the people of USA are equally responsible?"
">iran, turkey, Egypt

what absolutely zero geopolitical knowledge does to a mf"
Get better replies here
Are you asking why Palestinians have a right to exist? Or are you asking why Hamas is a terrorist org?
"No it has not. You have just been fed lies. Even if there are any un ethical behaviour, the percentage is very less and they're all charged for it."
Gujarat Model says Hi
Does it give them right to kill innocents and you morally support them?
">Hamas are the youngsters whose parents were killed by IDF,

Yeah no.  Hamas is a clear islamic terrorist organisation which wants to kill all the Jews from the land of Palestine. 

Also Israel never begun a fight, it only ended the fight"
You don't seem to know the fight between the Palestinian govt in the west bank and Hamas in Gaza. Hamas is against the Palestinian Govt.
Clueless pseudo pretentious validation seeking libturds and chal support karte hain cool lag rahaan Hain chappris and tweens.
"Yes, why should we help for no reason?"
No that is why we support the Palestinians resistance. Israel is bombing babies to death.
"Are you retarded or something? What kind of silly gotcha question is this? Do they not teach reading comprehension and argumentation in India anymore?

Obviously, I do not support the beheading of babies. The allegation that Hamas was beheading babies came from a journalist interviewing random IDF soldiers. Israel bombs hospitals and is collectively punishing 2 million Palestinians (which violates I-law). If you have any values other than hating Muslims then you will open your eyes."
LOL
"Why do news about 'Some dude from X country said something' inform so many people's views so easily? There are probably millions of Indians who worship Hitler and at least a hundred millions who support radical islam. 

The only thing that matters in international relations is the government's position and public opinion polls."
Yes according to the British. No according to India.
He did.
"https://youtube.com/shorts/BowKnnN-ps0?si=UBx5fQo6aNL6VC62

If it's a fight against ""terrorists"", why are there more images of suffering civilians than dead terrorists. It only matters when the victim is one of your own."
K
Saunders was obviously innocent.
"We need to stop pretending resistance to armed occupation enforced by the west is going to be nice and pretty.

If the IDF is justified in mass murdering civilians then why shouldn't the Hamas do the same? They are fighting for their land.

Even before the Nakba Israeli ultranationalists wiped out entire villages in 1947. How far back are you willing to go?"
Goodwill of Israel matters more than that of UAE and Saudi?
hamas didn't rape women or behead children. The Israelis made it up. Like the British would make things up when we were fighting the war in 1857. Sometimes we even did terrible stuff like burning English women alive. But does that invalidate the morality of our independence movement. No.
"A lot of people shit on freedom fighters, enjoying every day freedoms like nothing"
Funny how you're parroting such old talking points that even news channels have taken back now. There were no beheadings or rapes or naked women paraded
If you are a Christian you would believe the second coming of Christ
why the fuck should israel control gaza in the first place? and how does it relate to the two-state solution?
Israel has shown it has no interest in a two state solution.
">we do support palestinian rights and condemn the actions of israel

and what has this nebulous support achieved? the PLO was far morally superior to hamas, and they still got branded as terrorists. all i know is that hamas is the only thing keeping gazans from being wiped out. i may not like their methods, but i'm not going to begrudge them their way of doing things. as an outsider, i don't have that right"
"brain dead response. indian revolutionaries were smeared with far worse atrocity propaganda. and hamas, while doing heinous shit, is still 10x tamer than the IOF doing it. and yet, we're never asked to condemn the IOF as a terrorist group."
kashmir's people deserve a referendum
I dont consider it to be a terrorist organisation but a resistance movement. If people look up the definition of what a terrorist organisation is...the United States government would be the biggest terrorist of all.
"Regardless of whether it can or cannot, I think its pointless since it has no presence in india whatsoever. Funding it would be tracked regardless."
War is hell man. Acting like civilian casualties are the same thing as ordered rape and murder is insane

This is just 2023 before the Hamas response. Check the ""the very less percentage"" by IDF lol. It is almost all Israel.

They have killing children, women, journalists with impunity for years now"
Op is a bot and not a good one
What is Palestine resistance?
"Israel bombs hospitals 


I follow idf on twitter. Hamas hide behind human shield. Check their official account. You can see rocket launchers hidden in hospital. What you expect idf to do? It‚Äôs a zero sum game. Can‚Äôt justify terrorism."
Stop saying things you don‚Äôt mean
Stop lying
Yes but Bhagat Singh killed him by mistake. Are you saying Hamas thought they are killing IDF soldiers when they were actually killing babies and raping women?
"Something something two sides can be bad at the same time ... 

Whataboutism mat kar. 

There is no excuse for parading dead bodies of civilians."
Oil is important?
"They were literally on tape carrying a German woman naked on the back of a pickup truck parading her like a trophy with people spitting whose separated skull was later found.

WHAT THE FUCK are you white washing the scum?"
Was I shitting on Bhagat Singh? Learn to read you imbecile.
I agree they include Kunts on rw who shit on Gandhi and khangressis who shit on savarkar.
I saw Shani louck paraded on back of truck.
"I agree. But what you're suggesting essentially and practically means ceding control of Gaza to Hamas?

Do you consider Hamas a terrorist organization?"
Both side has shown little interest in it. Palestine especially.
"Jump from Indian revolutionaries== Hamas to Indians smeared with propaganda to Israeli forces?

Israel is right to eliminate threat to its civilians. Hamas are terrorists. Indian revolutionaries aren't heinous scum like Hamas."
What are the conditions for those referendum?
You're in a tiny minority around the world if you think Hamas is not a terrorist organization but the US government is the largest terrorists in the world. You're free to have your own opinions but for godsake have some perspective rather just being an edgelord.
"Hey bro/sis, by killing babies they‚Äôve cemented their place as terrorists. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôd consider them terrorists if your child was killed by them. 

What USA did was in reaction to the atrocities committed by terrorist groups. Same with Israel. 

There‚Äôs a difference between unprovoked actions vs reactions."
"This is the exact excuse that those guys used, those who did the 911"
Invaded Afghanistan for this to get OBL and his buddies but why invaded Iraq who had nothing to do with 9/11. I know Iraq had horrible dictator but many countries have them. It took away attention from Afghanistan it was Hilary and Joe Iraq conflict vote why I voted against them in 2016 and 2020 elections. It helped Obama win 2008 Dem primaries against Hilary.
"I don't think you are discussing in good faith, OP."
"Hamas, Fatah and other groups resisting Israeli occupation."
"yeah bro so lets bomb and kill children brilliant plan lets not let in aid to the 2 million people that live there bro 

no way you're insanely bootlicking Israel right now lmfao"
">Hamas hide behind human shield.

Absolutely makes no sense to use Human shields against Israel. They have proved a 100 times that Israel laughs and kills human shields.

&#x200B;

Did Israel not bomb the hospital because of ""human shields"". Of course not, they bombed it. they bombed churches ambulances schools everything."
"All I have said is that Bhagat Singh killed innocent Britisher according to Britishers.

But to us Indian, Bhagat Singh killed an oppressor britisher who was subjugating Indians.

This same rule applies for Mahatama Gandhi, Nehru and other Subash Chandra Bose. That's why Britishers put them in jail and we Indians call them freedom fighters."
"Bhagat Singh did not kill him, his companion did. They realized he was the wrong person before they shot him, but nevertheless decided to go through with the plan. Bhagat Singh supported this action."
"I promise you brother every accusation you make of the Hamas, Israel has done it 10 times worse.

I will not explain why a formerly colonised country should care about one that is currently colonised, that is your prerogative to care.

I know what I'm supporting."
"No skull was found, israel claimed to find a skull fragment that matched her dna, yeah they just happened to find that particular skull fragment. The German lady was being taken to the hospital. 

The IDF lies, they have a history of lying. The beheaded children claim was debunked, have you seen how they treat hostages in Gaza."
Yes
"And have you seen Palestinian babies being pulled out of rubble? Not just one, not two, but hundreds? Dead babies.

One incident is a tragedy. What happened to her sucks.

But hundreds of incidents is a genocide. And this isn't new, it has been happened for the last 7+ decades. After all those decades, do you expect people to stay peaceful? 

Hamas didn't just spring out of nowhere. The conditions of the Palestinian people created Hamas."
"what are waffling on about? gaza is not israeli territory. why should israel have a presence in gaza in the first place? do you know what the current borders are supposed to be? i don't think you do. israel has nothing to cede in gaza because it doesn't belong to them.

and no, i don't consider hamas a terrorist organisation. just like i wouldn't consider the IRA or the vietcong terrorists for defending their homeland."
Well the Mossad carbombed secular Palestine leaders so it's kind of hard to trust anything Israel says.
I don't care if I'm in the tiniest minority of all and you don't think people should have any differing opinions than yours if youre going to call me an edgelord. At least be honest about it.
And he would still be correct.
Unprovoked you say...you think this started on Oct 7 don't you.
Don‚Äôt judge. Be open minded
That‚Äôs the problem. We all believe Israel has right to exist
Do you have response to what I just said? What should idf do when innocent are used as human shields and they are asked to leave and never leave
That would be inhumane. I‚Äôm sure Israel won‚Äôt do that
That doesn‚Äôt mean Hamas isn‚Äôt terrorist
So killing an assistant SP (whose boss was directly responsible for killing a peaceful protestor by ordering lathi charge and saunders likely himself was involved in the lathi charge) is the same as raping and killing innocent civilians and families?
based.
So you are saying Shani is alive with Hamas?
I'm explaining to you that anyone who opposes Western ideology would be called a terrorist. You think I'm shitting on Bhagat Singh. If only you atleast had the deduction skills of a 10 year old.
"So your reply is

1) it didn't happen

I give you an example

2) okay, but have you seen this.

You are the one praising Hamas. I am condemning death of civilians on both sides.

It's not one 1000 people died and raped in that terrorist attack. Hundreds kidnapped.

No amount of mental gymnastics would justify terrorism."
"The IRA didn't rape innocent women or shot children though. Our revolutionaries attacked the officers‚Ä¶the people of authority who were enslaving us. They never lost their purpose.

These guys indiscriminately attack anyone from babies to grandparents. These monsters rape young girls, kill them and parade their bodies as trophies.

These people aren‚Äôt revolutionaries. Just terrorists who have lost all humanity. And anyone who supports them is a terrorist sympathizer.

You can support Palestine without supporting Hamas. But if you support Hamas then you are nothing but a terrorist sympathizer. Two wrongs never make a right."
"The question here is practical. What you're suggesting practically means Gaza goes under the control of Hamas. Have you thought about the ramifications of such a thing happening?

Be practical instead of blind idealism in policy matters."
"Thinking Hamas is not a terrorist organization is definitely edgelordism. The other option is that you're an  Islamic fundamentalist, which I charitably believe you're not."
I‚Äôm not sure if this will get through your terrorist sympathiser skull but killing babies as retribution is a red line. For this sole reason Hamas are terrorists.
Don't judge. Be open minded.
kuch bhi!
By using apartheid? You should know better our ancestors suffered the same fate.
"Sure, but a) that doesn't give them a right to use apartheid to their ends and b) they can do that through a 2 state solution. In reality, Israel is a warmongering nuclear state which recieves a ton of funding from western states because it is the only white country in the Middle East. It should be dismantled and Europe can allocate its land somewhere if it wants a Jewish state instead of displacing and genociding the Arabs who live there."
"Okay so basically you're saying that IDF is justified to kill innocent civilians because allegedly according to THEIR propaganda Hamas is hiding there. 

So if you think killing civilians is okay why can't Hamas kill civilians? What's the threshold to you saying killing civilians is actually wrong? 

If the IDF propaganda is true, and Hamas is using human shields, that's fine. It a) serves their own sentiment that the IDF is killing civilians and b) this is a collective punishment regardless, which is a war crime."
"Oh really! Is that your argument, lol. You are sure Israel won't do what they have always been doing! How do you think they established the country?! By attacking civilians and kicking them out of their homes in 1948!  


You yourself know that Israel just bombed hospitals, churches and ambulances and you also say Israel wont do that.

And here is Israel's track record in 2023 before the Hamas response.

I didn't say that.
"That term is subjective, it's the point the guy tried to make. Your opinion says terrorist."

Umm yeah. Do you want to be killed if your boss had committed a murder? What kinda logic is this?!"
Hamas killed innocents
"1. She was not paraded around and it did in fact not happen. There are no beheaded babies either.

2. You're the one sucking off Israel


It's only terrorism when a brown person does it."
">the IRA didn't rape innocent women or shot children though

this is revisionism. the atrocity propaganda the british put out about the IRA was horrifying. who's to say israel isn't doing the same thing? they have lied about every single thing so forgive me for not taking their claims about hamas at face value.

is hamas a group of saints? not at all, and i would personally prefer the DFLP/PFLP to be at the forefront of the resistance. but considering the despicable atrocities being carried out by the IOF, they're absolutely the lesser evil.

>terrorist sympathiser

yes every single oppressive regime in history has branded all opposition as terrorists. the mau mau rebellion, the algerian rebels, haitian slave rebellion.. they were all branded as terrorists by the people who had been terrorising them for decades. your oppressors are going to label you terrorists no matter what you do, so why pine for their approval? all that moral grandstanding will do is get you killed. as the peaceful palestinian protestors found out.

as an outsider living a cushy life in a (relatively) safe country, i am in no position to moralise a nation fighting for its survival."
"gaza is already under the control of hamas. they won a plurality in 2006 and have been in control ever since because elections have been banned by israel since then. and the more israel bombs the population the more orphans are created and the more these orphans support hamas.

don't prattle on about ""practical"" if you don't know the history of the region and can't even understand why hamas has so much support."
"Elaborate then how it is a terrorist organisation as opposed to the United States government foreign policy. You don't have to be charitable at all, if you can call me an edgelord feel free to label me an Islamist fundamentalist."
You're talking about the 40 beheaded babies aren't you lol yes let's trust the bbc cuz they've always been the patrons of truth. Even piers morgan backpedaled on it but sure you believe that through and through. You know more.
They are forced. Idf says Hamas use people as human shield. Digging tunnels with money that could be used to build hospitals. They are clearly terrorists. What would Israel do if Hamas hide behind human shield in school and hospital and launch rockets from there? Do you support rockets fired by Hamas just because they are not Jewish? Is that the issue?
"War is political tool. nothing legal or illegal. Who is strong is right. Things might be morally wrong or right but who would decide? The person who says my God  is only true God and everyone else worships. Satan, is a bad influence, does us versus them is the root cause of all evil. So long as people don‚Äôt believe that God exists and we all worship the same God, nothing would change. Once I spoke to a Palestine guy, he said it‚Äôs a holy war. How war can be holy? Trust me war is not kind to anyone. No war is holy. People just die ti fulfil others political objective. I have heard they have oil in contested land. People kill and die for third person to get oil."
It‚Äôs all in defence. Check all western mainstream news
I didn't say anything about Hamas or Israel. I said about bhagat singh.
"Saunders was clearly part of the lathi charge.

\>Do you want to be killed if your boss had committed a murder?  
By this logic all of the IDF soldiers are also innocent civilians because they are just following their boss' order. WHAT KIND OF LOGIC IS THIS? HAMAS will be disappointed with you for calling IDF innocent."
"Israel killed far more innocents, where are your condemnations?"
Israelis and Palestinians are the same colour idiot.
So where was she taken? To the rose garden?
"Doesn't justify the actions of Hamas. And what about the videos of Hamas? The one which Hamas accounts themselves launched? The one where the body of a woman is being paraded? The hostages? Two wrongs never make a right. 

If you think to fight against an oppressive enemy you need to parade their women openly and spit on them, then you aren't really a freedom fighter. No matter what killing innocent civilians should be considered terrorism. A terrorist organisation is a terrorist organisation. Killing of innocent civilians should never be tolerated. Similarly the Israeli government should be condemned for the killings of the innocent civilians and it's discrimination towards the Palestinians before October 7. The settlers should be kicked out. Evil is evil. It is useless to debate which one is less evil. Someone killing innocent civilians in my eyes is a terrorist and should be designated as a terrorist."
You've made it amply clear that you want Gaza to be under the control of Hamas. That's good enough.
I don't think you're an Islamic fundamentalist.
Don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre beheaded or if it‚Äôs 40 babies. The fact that babies were even killed with wanton should be a concern. Guess being a terrorist sympathiser you‚Äôre fine with it.
"IDF has clearly never lied in the last 80 years. Not one single lie have they told. They are the most moral and upstanding army Oh wait: [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/videos-israeli-soldiers-abuse-palestinian-detainees-rcna123214](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/videos-israeli-soldiers-abuse-palestinian-detainees-rcna123214)

Maybe that was a one-off? https://www.thenationalnews.com/opinion/comment/the-lies-and-self-deceptions-at-work-within-israel-s-moral-army-1.709910

I support the complete destruction and tearing down of Israel yes because it is an apartheid neo-colonialist state. There are roads meant for Arabs and roads meant for Jews in Occupied Palestine as one example of apartheid. Maybe you shouldn't support the side that calls the civilians on the other side ""animals"" and suggests nuking them?

If that's not feasible, then a 2 state solution with pre-1967 borders is fine. BJPcucks really showed their sub-human form to the world during this war by loving Israel just for killing innocent Muslims lmao."
">Idf says Hamas use people as human shield.

Why would  Hamas use human shields when IDF has always been eager to kill civilians. Human shields are useless in Palestine, as they serve no purpose.

"The thing is you have know idea how things have come into these dire situations.  If you really like to have such a moral high ground, I would think you would despise the whole history of Israel and what it's forceful foundation led to."
"like i said, i am in no position to moralise to someone whose suffering is so far beyond what i can even imagine. all this talk about branding hamas as terrorists and nobody has ever floated the idea of declaring israel as a terrorist state, despite the actions of the IOF being 10x worse than hamas. this call for condemnation of hamas is not genuine. it's just an attempt to discredit the palestinians' right to self determination. i'll condemn hamas the same day all the world governments condemn israel the same way

let me ask you this: would you condemn the haitian or algerian rebels? they did some heinous shit too."
"indeed it is. and seeing how you don't have any response to that, i'd say it was an argument well made."
You certainly think so now youre just being charitable to come off as someone who accepts a differing viewpoint.
"Quick data snatch for you my friend

Both the Israeli Defense Forces and militant Palestinian groups have been accused of violating the rights of children and causing injury and death. According to B'tselem's calculations (2021), some 2,171 Palestinian children have been killed in the last two decades by Israeli military actions,[2][3] and 139 Israeli children have been killed by Palestinian militants

Let's not forget kids are kids no matter which side they're born at. You don't have to sympathize with any side just educate yourself before taking a hard stance is my request with all due respect as a fellow redditor. We don't have to fight with each other about this bro. The world is already split way too wide open and it's only a mass grave of children in the middle."
Bet you have no idea how many kids died on both sides in comparison. You don't have to be a terrorist sympathiser like me but if you care about kids at least be a kid sympathiser maybe. You can hate me for what i say but atleast love kids without your little biases.

https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-israel-hamas-conflict-india-calls-for-immediate-and-unconditional-release-of-hostages-3067815

While you continue to support them morally, Hamas continues to hold innocent civilians as hostages!



Without naming Hamas, India also called for ‚Äúimmediate and unconditional‚Äù release of hostages. Israel has been carrying out a massive military offensive in Gaza following the unprecedented and multi-pronged attacks on Israeli cities by Hamas militants on October 7.

Hamas killed around 1,400 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 220. Around 10,500 people have been killed in Gaza in the Israeli offensive, according to the Hamas-run authorities in Gaza. At his weekly media briefing, Spokesperson in the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Arindam Bagchi said India has made its position clear on the Hamas-Israel conflict on multiple occasions including during the UN General Assembly debate on October 27."
"I am not lying and will gladly accept my mistake if proven wrong in this regard.

Lets assume conditionally for a second that Saunders was, conclusively, in no way involved in lathi charge. Is killing him in the heat of the moment same as killing and raping innocent civilian women and children in cold blood? The civilians were not part of Israeli administration in any way unlike Saunders."
10000 Palestinians most of them under 18 have been killed by carpet bombing.
"I despise genocide no matter what. What happened in the past cannot be changed. But the children who are born there cannot be removed. You cannot throw out neither the Jewish nor the Palestinian population from there. Also Hamas is a pos. 

If they have problems with Israel then why did they abduct the Thai workers. Why were the Nepali students killed by Hamas? They were innocent and had no history with Israel or Palestine."
">Would you condemn the haitian or algerian rebels? they did some heinous shit too.

I don't have much knowledge about this, so I don't know. But if they did heinous shit then yes I will condemn them. 

Let me ask you this: What did the Thai workers or the Nepali students have to do with Israel Palestine? Why were they killed?"
Doesn't need a response.
"The differing view being that Hamas are not terrorists. Lol

Do you also consider Pol Pot to be a revolutionary leader?"
"With all due respect, please do not call me your friend. I‚Äôm not and I never wish to be. I‚Äôd rather be electrocuted than be ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with a terrorist sympathiser. 

Also, if the Palestinian forces (military or otherwise) use kids as human shields and schools as rocket launching sites then of course there are going to be kids killed in Palestine. 

Please show me a case where Israel killed babies as a strategy then I‚Äôll take your argument with any credence."

We are just going around in circles now. Doesn‚Äôt matter who is right or wrong. War is evil we both must agree. Do we agree on this part or not?
"No, war is not evil by itself. The justifications for war can be evil but can also be good (fighting against Nazis or genocidal dictators or an invading force)."
This is where we do not agree. Man killing man isn‚Äôt evil?
No faith or person on this planet thinks that. Unjust killing is evil but killing for a just cause is perfectly fine.
"Basically we all want same things- love, food, sleep, shelter. Creating issue over mythical creatures is creating issues for no reason."
It didn't start on October 7.
"You push down and terrorize a group of people for *years* who aren't even considered a country enough to qualify voting for a resolution regarding ceasefire in a war they're implicated in (while the other belligerent can), will flowers grow out of its soil or Hamas? Isrealis are unsafe today because of its own government; no wonder even at a time of war where nationalism should be rampant, Bibi is losing support of his citizens."
I agree with the Indian government's views on this. Hamas is a terrorist organisation. They should be killed. But not at the expense of innocent civilians from both sides. I support the 2 state solutions and both the countries have the right to exist.
"Support Palestinian Authority, Two State Solution and dismantling of Hamas."
"One of the Oct 7 attacks involved killing a man, while his wife watched, then raping wife while their baby was cooked in an oven. Pretty sure this was well planned.

If this is what Palestinians and Hamas are doing and have excuses like this didn't start on Oct 7 and they are not at fault, then they are being served right by Israel. Such people don't deserve a well civilized life in a society.

There could be Palestinians who are not with Hamas but all I can say is good luck to them."
Thank you. I don‚Äôt get how so many people do not realise that or maybe they‚Äôre just pretending to be oblivious.
"Google Sabra and Shatila Massacre. Neither justifies the other but this cycle didn't start on October 7, 2023."
Half of them are pretending to be oblivious due to their political religious affiliations...the rest are just willingly or unwillingly ignorant and don't care to educate themselves before taking a hard stance on the matter like in every other case. They think Oct7 was an out of the blue provocation and have no idea about the events leading up to it like Bibis display of the new Israeli map at the UN and Israel-Arab normalisation of relations completely bypassing the Palestinian issue.
"Do not poke your nose in Israel's conflicts. US has learned it the hard way, USS Liberty Incident.
It is impossible to solve when neither Israelis nor Palestinians would compromise."
"There is nothing anyone can do. No country is willing to give up what it considers to be its lands. It can never happen without all out war and one side winning comprehensively. Even then, sometimes, as in the case with the bungled Kashmir episode, one country cannot claim land as its own. These disputes have no solution because there are just too many vested interests which profit from the conflict and will do anything to make sure there is no solution."
I think India should stay out of this. There's more to the story than being portrayed. They are fighting to get those oil reserves. The west and middle east are using a proxy narrative to do so but this won't benefit India in any way shape or form. Even in good intentions i believe they'll find a way to burn India on both of the fronts.
Lets stop fooling ourselves. The jihadi victimhood did not start with either Palestine or Kashmir. And it will continue till last Kaafir is exterminated from planet. So anyone talking about peace is smoking something very potent.
"1. Al aqsa complex should be evacuated and bombed into oblivion to humble Islamists worldwide.

2. Gaza and west bank be occupied and Arabs living there be dispersed in other countries or given Israeli citizenship."
We should conquer Israel and Palestine. Make it pagan again and honor the Gods by rebuilding their temples
">What is the solution for Israel Palestine situation? What can government of India do to bring peace to the region? Sending Indian army would help?

There is nothing anyone can do against a mentality.  Pallestanians  dont want a 2 state solution. So  unless pallestinians change their mentality (which is not possible in short term), there is only 1 immediate solution that is to destroy one of the 2 nations completely and I stand with Israel if it comes to that.

But I dont think they are doing this,  they are going to prelong this hoping that 1 day pallestanians will become OK with israel existing. And I personally think that is a bad move. Pallestanians will just wait to gather their strength and attack again when ready. This has been seen again and again.

Israel at the moment doesnt need help, they themselves are competent and resourceful enough to handle hamas and pallestanians. They may need help if other countries gets involved, but I dont see that happening. All the muslim countries are only egging other countries to take actions, but noone is actively taking action afaik. Its all talks and threats. And I think its smart of them to do so since Israel has proved itself capable of fighting all these countries together in the past.

But as Israel suggested, India can help bringing the hamas leaders back to gaza so that they can eradicate them. Additionally, they are facing shortage of workers atm, India can send workers to keep their economy up."
"Indian army already has its plate full
Burdening them with another responsibility of this magnitude won't help at all

About the issue, careful diplomatic talks are the only way forward. But that means commoners on both sides need to be ready for peace."
Sending the Indian army to do what exactly? I'm sorry but are you on drugs?
I bet Hamas is really happy with the everyday lynching of Muslims in India.
In no news portal is oil being discussed
Israel and Palestine are the parts of Akhand Bharat. We will bring back the Vikramaditya Empire ! /s

 Never happened. Fake news
Look deeper. On the coastline of Palastine are oil rigs. Israel wants them. Do your research and stop following false mainstream media propaganda factories.
"Bro IDF is perfectly handling the situation, no need to run our noses where not required. I can believe you are serious about this. I hope not."
"Bro thanks for the insight, it is something def not being talked about at all. I didn't even know about the oil rigs. Could also do without the condescension, just the factoid was enough"
"Another thing to add is that USA may be involved as well because Saudi was going to recognize Israel soon and setup a new corridor for Trade which would have hampered the already set corridor placed by USA for very specific reasons. In no way were Hamas idiot enough to attack Israel in such a fashion knowing fully well this time Israel would finish each and everyone of them off. Plus, the coincidence is very suspicious given that the attack happened so soon after the talks of Israeli trade corridor with Saudi. Most probably USA did this to see that because of Ummah bs, as Israelis have retaliated now they can't possibly recognize Israel as a nation as it would greatly deplete their own reputation as an Islamic state, which in turn would led to cancellation of that trade corridor."

Read about the origin of the term holy war. Abrahamic religions are always fighting each other claiming holy war and in a way the current situation is an extension of that sentiment - Judaism vs Islam. Christianity has thrown its towel in Judaism‚Äôs corner cause geopolitics. So religion definitely plays a role which means the word holy is justified but I wouldn‚Äôt use the term war for something that‚Äôs clearly a genocide.

Are you stupid?
"War is law of nature so ""evil"" is not a correct term.

Every species fight each other and within themselves so its just the law of nature. Don't produce kids if you want to protect them from wars."
There is only one way. Start a war with them. Peace was never an option.
"If the war fought for peace, freedom, upliftment, destroying evil will be called holy war. 

If the evil won in that war, it will be called the evil war. the destruction rate is severe, war damage on land, homes, rations are soo cruel. 

Now, Hitler took started war due to mistreatment at the Paris peace conference and for bad behaviours like slavery, taxing, colonizing, extracting sources. But he took a war that could kill millions of people, and that is why it is called an evil war. 

War is evil and holy is determined by interpretation of the war to the people. Like Jesus worked for people's freedom long age and Nelson mandella helped for Black's freedom in WW2. Jesus and Mandella are not treated the same, cause of interpretation of the person."
"This is why al-aqsa should be bombed and reduced to rubble, Palestinians care more about their religion than children.

You know Greeks who are Christians left Anatolia when they deemed it fit, even though it's sacred land for them, why wouldn't Arabs leave?

Christians and Muslims have fought each other (and random others) in holy wars for centuries. The Mossad and the Israeli government are the most violent and dangerous representatives of Jews *ever*, and historically speaking they're relatively new. This is truly the first time in history (just the last maybe 75 years) that the Jews have fought for themselves in any meaningful way.

Reminds me of a lyric from a NOFX song, *The Brews* (short for HEbrews): 'Pacifism no longer tradition' speaking about the Jewish community as a whole. 

Just food for thought."
There was actually enough land to go around till Britain the master coloniser walked in‚Ä¶they‚Äôve loved together for centuries and there has been ‚Äòholy wars‚Äô but in modern history Palestine was not really a problem‚Ä¶
Hao ?
"I would add that Christians and Jews consider Jerusalem to be their holiest of holy lands, while Mecca (Islam's equivalent place) is 1,500 kms from Jerusalem."
Behave
what about give their land back and not commit genocide?
Holy wars in abrahamic religions existed way before even British culture was formed.
"In Chinese it means ""good."" 
As in okay. Good. And move on."
"Those are two distinct things, genocide may also stop if gazans settle elsewhere."
Nah but they were still coping fine‚Ä¶till now.
so basically you want people to leave their homes and go somewhere else... and that too millions of people huh
"Bruh. Maybe you need to read some history.

There's a whole period of crusades where the pope (yes the pope) asked the fine Christians in the west to fight the Muslim powers near Constantinople 

(present day Istanbul, then was controlled by Christians - called the holy Roman Empire - very little relation to the romans)

As you would expect, these fine Christian warriors were given salvation and Pardon in return for this war and they did a decent amount of damage to Christian kingdoms as well before they actually fought the Muslims.

People have been fighting religion based wars for a very long time. And will continue to do so because religion can easily make you believe that you are the one who is right and the other side is wrong and less than humans or deserving death."
I would not call the last 70 or so years in Palestine/ Israel 'coping fine'.
"No. Even ignoring your hideous use of the word 'now' you're still categorically wrong. 

The Abrahamic religions are Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Look at their history of 'getting along' (Crusades, anyone? Spanish Inquisition?)

Who will make them? What army will send volunteers to fight Israel from the side of gaza?

Sanctions aren't possible and neither will they affect Israel, it's also illegal to boycott Israel for American companies which work for the government on a contract basis, all in all Israel is invincible."
"through egypt?

why would egypt take them...there are millions of people... do you think from so many years they wouldn't have thought of that ... no country would want to collapse their economy after taking millions of people... it would take years to settle them

its not the point to take gaza's side ... its the point that no country should invade other countries... and specifically not tell the people who are being oppressed to ""don't reproduce"" and ""move somewhere else because we would kill you if you don't"" 

people should speak out if some country is bullying others 

if this goes on israel will move further .. they will start invading other countries then you will again say no options people should move out and stop reproducing"
The United Nations's one job is to prevent WW3. It is doing an excellent job for now.
"they cannot enforce something. their member states can.  but the last time it happened was in korean war. and afterwards UN never officially involved itself from one side in any war , now they just send humanitarian aid to nations at war , and monitor active borders like the UN security lines where UN troops \[ from other nations\] get to serve as border patrols in disputed regions such as Cypurus

UN can also vote and pass resolutions condeming attacks , calling for peace or ceasefire. but these resolutions are ultimately NON BINDING in nature. and the subject country may choose to not obey them. 

UN then can move on to scanctions. which work to an extent but nation like India does not agrees on one sided scanctions , it will only agree if all other nations agree to also scanction that particular nation. 

basically UN can provide humanatrian aid in gaza , put scanctions on israel \[ unlikely \] and try to broke peace which it has failed to due to the parties not being on a mutual agreement."
"""The United Nations was not created to take mankind to heaven, but to save humanity from hell."" It is said

It also is needed to provide humanitarian aid. 

UN never will, and never should be like a world parliament or world government which will interfere with army in each war quashing it. Because then the domination of US and western countries would fuck up the world. And slowly it would become like Oceania(if you know you know)"

Hindu israeli supporters barely know anything about hinduism itself. They just hate muslims
They don‚Äôt support Israel for religious reasons. It‚Äôs fight of Good versus evil. Hamas terrorists attacked innocent Israel people. That‚Äôs why people support Israel
"Hindu Israeli don't even know about the ""Judaism"" as a religion.  


They are supporting Israel only for their anti-muslim stand and Israel's help to India during wars against Pakistan."
"People don't support israel out of love for Jews or Zionism or Israel, but out of resentment for Islamic radicalism. Also Judaism is not anymore different than Islam however Jews/Judaism has never directly harmed Hindus/India so most people don't care what beliefs they follow as long as they keep it in their country. Same couldn't be said for the other one."
"Yes, but loosing sleep over something or the mere existence of a group of people who have opposing views to one's own, is primarily a liberal or muslim thing."

The other side has the exact same view of Hinduism.
Jews don‚Äôt proselytize. Judaism is a matter of being rather than a matter of beliefs."
No and it doesnt matter. People oppose terrorism and war criminals alike. Objective analysis would suggest both sides are to blame for this mess in gaza/israel. Their elected governments are both hardliners and the very people who put them to powers are suffering the most.
">Does Hindu Israeli supporters knows that Judaism goes against Hindu believes?

I am guessing you meant Palestinians vs Israeli - Well, there are enough reasons and much many more impartial sources for this answer, but since you asked what I dislike about Israeli actions - here is a short list
- Naqba / Israeli apartheid
- Illegal expansions in Gaza / Treating Palestine as 3rd class citizens
- Communal ""punishment"" for a terror act. if not for the blind support of the USA, there would have been international sanctions already on Israel.
- Refusal or supression of a two state solution.


Resentment creates hate, hate leads to willingness to do harm and that is when politics and religion take hold of people. That is how you create terrorists in your back yard.


All the above is Israel  - but Palestinians are equally / more so to blame for this as well. India and South Africa was oppressed for 200 years, we grew out of it - mostly peacefully. They should have chosen their leaders better and seeked peaceful separation. Hamas =barbarian terrorists = palestine  is the common man's interpretation.



 Well, that still doesnt justify Israeli actions to drop more bombs than US dropped over Iraq in a decade. All this in the most densely populated stretch of 20km land in that area. That is a war crime and has to stop."

>their population is overwhelmingly children, and have been blockaded for more than a decade and a half now.

Don't know what children have to do with the argument. You know Hamas recruits children right? And even with a blockade they managed to buy all these missiles and guns. The blockade should continue for Israel's safety.

>While Isrealis deserve peace and safety, the terrorist attack by Hamas wasn't entirely unprovoked

If you can think of how Hamas has the right to attack babies, you should easily understand why Israelites have the right to bomb Gaza.

 >their shitty unpopular Israeli government under Bibi failed hilariously.

Idk what Bibi is, but yes israel failed to protect its citizens. Which is probably why they are either going to re occupy Gaza again or let a neutral 3rd party govern it.

The people who call for Israel's ceasefire should really take the responsibility that neither Hamas or any such terrorist organisation from Gaza will ever attack israel. If they can't take such a responsibility israel is allowed to deal with the problem however they know to deal with it.

>If you have an issue with Muslims everywhere that's your personal judgement

I only have issue with the intolerant folks. I am all for tolerant muslims. I already said who  they are. The muslims who wouldnt become violent when someone questions their weak believes. People who doesn't throw a tantrum saying my feelings got hurt.

>doesn't look like you even understand the nuances here.

In the past they were Gaza was controlled by egyptions and west bank was controlled by Jordon.  These countries are not taking refugees because in the past they took them in and the pallestanians tried to kill these country,'s leaders. Ofc they don't want them. Who wants to import terrorists, I don't blame them.


>Naqba / Israeli apartheid : need to read about this, but I doubt it's as simple as they displaced people for the heck of it.  Probably something like what is happening today might have occured, where they were asked to move if they don't want to die in cross fire. But yes I admit idk, above is a speculation


>Illegal expansions in Gaza :  israel was attacked by the Arabs, they expanded hoping it would cause them to stop the attack. Each time Arabs aka pallestanians attacked, the lost a bit of land. I think it might happen again with the current attack too.


>Treating Palestine as 3rd class citizens

Gaza was not governed by Israelis at all.  They were governed by Hamas.  Israelis had completely pulled out of Gaza, including the security personnels in 2005. Result of which was this attack. It does make sense why some areas in west bank has military rule. The area is not exactly peaceful to simply let civil law take place.

>Communal ""punishment"" for a terror act.

Not really, it's not Israel's fault that Hamas uses its civilians as body armour. Once israel has pulled out of Gaza, it has no responsibility of the civilians in it.  If the military of that country uses its civilians as body armour, it is the fault of that government.

>if not for the blind support of the USA, there would have been international sanctions already on Israel.

I doubt it. Muslim countries may sanction because they are making this into a religious issue, but other than that noone will condemn israel because the war was initiated by the other side.


>All this in the most densely populated stretch of 20km land in that area. That is a war crime and has to stop.

The war crime is not being done by the Israelites, it is being done by the Hamas leaders who uses civilians as body armour. Ofcourse the body armour is going to be damaged in a war."
"I don't know anyone who has Hitler in their profile photo.not sure from where you are getting this.

You need to ask them why they have it and whether it is because of his hatred towards Jews.

But just a fyi, the people who support pallestine, if their wishes come true, they would be truly be following Hitler. Displacing or exterminating Jews."
"They didn't come out of nowhere. 

That area was colonized by the british. And Jews moved into the land with british blessings. It is the Arabs who were also living in the area who had a problem with it. Which lead to violence in the area after british left which lead to the 2 nation theory since the people living in the same area couldnt live peacefully.

Besides, this area was originally of the Jews before the Arabs and Romans invaded it and displaced the Jews. The Arabs only got this place because of this invasion and displacement.

If you are applying the same concept to India, how do you think Indians have so many muslims?  People from foreign countries came and settled here. How do you think pakistan was formed? Those  people demanded a different country.  How did india resolve it, they allowed it to happen."
But why do you literary puritanists always have some double standards? And was I wrong with my original comment?
I don't have a religion but I am Islamophobic because they preach their religion unlike Hindus and force people to follow. Modern Israel is more civilized than Muslims and usually only parents force their children to religion but they don't force convert.

"Valid reason can be found if you pick a side first.

Opinions and support on Twitter doesn't matter. Half of those ppl can't point Israel on map if asked to. It's like Pakistan vs anyother country cricket match for them. Just cheerleaders.

>Hamas deserves to be eliminated

Good Israel is doing that effectively.

>I do not support genocide.

Israel is not doing genocide. The poppulation of Gaza has always been on the rise. If it was a genocide, its the worst genocide ever. A rising poppulation genocide.

If you are talking about civilians dying when israel attacks Hamas. I wouldnt blame israel for hamas using civilians as human shield. If you  need to destroy Hamas, their body armour will be damaged. The death of the civilians is Hamas's fault, not israels.

&#x200B;

>Religion is general is not compatible with long term peace.

I agree with this. People are too much caught up in religion.

&#x200B;

>But doesn't mean civilians can be killed.

No it doesnt mean that. But them being the body armour of Hamas makes them dead.

Israelis are not targeting the civilians, they are targeting Hamas, Civilians are just on the way... put there by hamas.

>This is a complex issue. genocide will not resolve it

This is a very simple issue from my view. Its just that resolution of the issue is very violent. If there was a true genocide, it would resolve it definitely, but israel would lose the support of many countries.

&#x200B;

>Opinions and support on Twitter doesn't matter. Half of those ppl can't point Israel on map if asked to. It's like Pakistan vs anyother country cricket match for them. Just cheerleaders.

Dont agree with this one, Indians support and feel for israel, because India faces similar attacks from Pakistan. Where they will attack and call themself the victim.

>Considering the history, this war was in the making for a long time. It should be fought like a war (modern war) not gengis khan style.

Israel is willing to do that, it is the Hamas which is not ready to do that.  Israel is ready to let the civilians move to the southern Gaza, to egypt or whatever. Its the Hamas, who points guns at their civilians and tell them to stay there for Hamas's protection.

In such a scenario, I am all with Israel.  Pallestine civilians are also not a bunch of innocent people. Like many muslims around the world, they also celebrated when Hamas attacked Israel civilians. Not to mention they elected Hamas to power.

"it's not israel who needs to be held responsible when it Gazan's govt is responsible for putting the civilians in danger. I have no idea why the left think they should.

I am saying the people who are calling for cease fire should also take responsibility and say that I will take responsibility of these terrorists, if they attack israel again, you can put me in jail and and take all my money for aiding the families of the people the terrorist organization killed.

If you can't take such responsibilities and gaurantees, yes israel is free to deal with the terrorist how they see fit and yes their body armour will be destroyed. Doesn't matter whether the body armour wanted to be there or not."
What is the definition?
Why did so many people support the Indian freedom struggle when they have initiated all the wars against Britain? I feel like people are blaming the British Raj for defending themselves and wanting to survive.
"Its extremely complex situation.  


If Israel gives power to palastine , Chances are high that palastine with other Islamic countries will invade and finish Israelis.  
ON OTHER HAND  
If palastine lives with israel , Israelis will not give them same rights like other Israelis living there .  


General public of both dont want a two state solution . Every leader that talks about two state either loses or gets killed .   


Basically both the groups will exploit the other if they are in power . Hence there is no solution to it . It will keep on going ."
"Just google 1947 Nakba, You will see the atrocities and war crimes committed by Israeli soldiers.

There is no Hamas in the West Bank, why did the IDF kill 30+ children from the start of 2023?

Brother remember one thing it's not about land it's about religion. Arab don't want jew in middle east. They claim tha land belongs to muslim because jew came to israel after world war 2. but the same people start crying when hindus use the same logic to claim their temple back. Not a single muslim would have said anything if jew and Christians were fighting.
Maybe want to read up on that first mate
"Because Israel doesn't simply defend itself. It also harms more innocents than terrorists. If it were simply sending secret ops to eliminate the hamas or something like that, it'd be easy to support them. Not when they kill a dozen civilians per a single hamas member"
"If you see what has happening in the long run, you will sympathize for Palestinians.
If you just see what Hamas did recently, you would maybe sympathize for Israel.

Hamas is a violent group. It is a fact. But does it represents all of the Palestinians ? I don't think so.
Even if Hamas is violent if you see in the long term you might sympathize with their cause.
Is violence by Hamas is the answer? Maybe not. But does Israel even wants to have a two state solution? And if Palestine doesn't get a separate state, what options do they have? They can't live as the 2nd grade citizen in Israel.

Still attacking innocent people is highly condemnable.
In such a complex situations, rather than supporting any side you should support the common people on both sides who have nothing to do with th situation.

Condemn violence and support a two state state solution which is also India's official position."
Not so many people lol only muslims support plaestine. Every muslim I know support Palestine.
"The real issue arose when the arabs decided to have war, instead of coexisting with the Israelis.

"Because Israelites currently are mostly europeans and americans, they don't belong in Israel/palestine. Many jews( mostly indigenous from the Holy Land) are supporting Palestine. There is an org. jewish voice for peace, Torah judaism, etc. 

Also, they literally kill people for fun.

DNA test is also banned in Israel so that they don't find out they are europeans. 

The fight is not for name, flag, or religion. They are literally fighting against colonisation.

The fact that all people in the world born jews are invited to be citizens of Israel is wrong in so many levels.

Israel also accepted giving contraceptive shots to Black jews without their permission. 
It's not jews vs. muslims. It's colonisers vs. indigenous people

"But history states otherwise,

Jews lived best when living in arab nations.  
When Umar (2nd Caliph) conquered Jerusalem he was requested by exiled Jewish families to allow them to return. He allowed 70 Jewish families to return to Jerusalem, despite the opposition from the Christians in Jerusalem.   
Umar was a close friend of Muhammad and this was the first time Muslims had gained control of Jerusalem.   
Here onwards there are many documented instances in the history of Jews running to Muslim lands seeking refuge.   
The rise of anti-Semitism in the Muslim world around the year 1948 was a direct result of the conflict in Palestine. Jews being expelled from Muslim countries was a result of Muslims being expelled from Palestine.   
If arab were that bad to the Jews what were they doing living in Middle Eastern and North African countries for generations? If arab are that bad why did they want to return to Palestine and establish their state in arab land. They weren't afraid of this supposed oppression for generations and now they turn¬†around¬†and¬†lie.  


Look at the history where Jews were expelled  from its mostly Europe

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsions\_and\_exoduses\_of\_Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsions_and_exoduses_of_Jews)

Even thou its a Wikipedia article you will find all the citations at the bottom of the page,you can cross-reference it.

The fact is Israelis came to Palestine to seek shelter.

They took the land because of the zionist agenda and caused the nakba of 1947.

They kept illegally occupying Palestine for the last 75 years.

Palestine is an apartheid state.

Google the massacre that took place during 1947 nakba"
I agree with everything other than that Israel and its people wantba 2 state solution. It's the pallestanians who doesn't want this.
It's better that Palestinians set aside their ego and leave for other Arab countries.
">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killings\_and\_massacres\_during\_the\_1948\_Palestine\_war

In this link itself, in the history section it says that the Arabs started it"
"Since you asked me to answer :

>just google 1947 Nakba, You will see the atrocities and war crimes committed by Israeli soldiers.

What you are refering to is the displacement of Arab people from the land that UN had declared was for the Jews.  What Nakba doesn't talk about is that there was a similar displacement of Jews from all the Arab nations surrounding israel. Since Nakba is an Arabic term.

Why did both sides displace people based on religion, because they were fighting a war for the creation of israel. 

Your link to the Wikipedia article doesn't work for this.


>Hamas was created in 2006, Why there was Israeli terrorising Palestinian civilians before that? Why is this an apartheid state for a decades? is this also Hamas's fault?

Israel controls many of the pallestanian land because the pallestanians don't agree for a 2 state solution. They want to eradicate israel.  Israel wants nothing to do with pallestine, they just want to be left alone.  But if the opposing party tells that they will destroy israel if freedom is provided to them then obviously they won't be granted freedom.

How did they get occupied to begin with? They got occupied when they lost the wars they initiated. It has nothing to do with Hamas as you stated.

>There is no Hamas in the West Bank, why did the IDF kill 30+ children from the start of 2023?

Hamas is not the only terrorist organization in that area. West bank also has terrorists. 

I know that many children die in west bank, but I have only heard  one sided narrative on this. I will need to check why they die. If they die because they are the shields of PLA, then that makes sense. But if they are targeting children, which I don't think is the case based on what I have seen so far, then yes that's bad of israel.

The west bank is a more complex matter than Gaza since israel has parts of it occupied, I would  blame israel (partially) since the land is under their control to some level.  If they are unable to control it, they should leave it and treat it the same way as Gaza. Let the PLO handle it. If the pallestine attack israel post that, attack their military without considering whether they use human shields or not. That is my opinion.

Even in Gaza, I don't think israel should adopt these half measures to try and save the civilian. I think they should bomb where the gazan military is. Whether they established their military within civilian population or not is irrelevant. With such measures pallestanians will think twice before attacking israel again."
It's very deep politics. DM me. I can explain a few things
Every news article you'll see will be biased one. One thing I can say for sure is...America is behind this.
Who is claiming Hindu temple in Israel?
Tell me which war was initiated by israel and I will read up more on it.
"How is Israel responsible for Hamas using their own civilians as human shields? 

I mean the Gazan's elected for Hamas to be their government. And their government decided to use the civilians as human shields. 

If israel doesn't attack considering the civilian population, what exactly stops Hamas from performing an another attack and hide behind their population?  Once Israel left Gaza and let the people govern itself in 2005, I think israel no longer has any responsibility for the people of Gaza. That would be responsibility of the whatever government Gaza elected after that."
">If you see what has happening in the long run, you will sympathize for Palestinians. If you just see what Hamas did recently, you would maybe sympathize for Israel.

Even though my opinion on supporting Israel is based on what happend rescently, the real support I gave is after I realised that all the wars was initiated by the Arabs. 

>Hamas is a violent group. It is a fact. But does it represents all of the Palestinians ? I don't think so.

I think the majority do,  I mean Hamas was elected by the same people and Hamas always had a stance to destroy israel. 

Overall, 57% of Gazans express at least a somewhat positive opinion of Hamas‚Äîalong with similar percentages of Palestinians in the West Bank (52%) and East Jerusalem (64%)‚Äîthough Gazans who express this opinion of Hamas are fewer than the number of Gazans who have a positive view of Fatah (64%).

>Even if Hamas is violent if you see in the long term you might sympathize with their cause.

I did check the long term view, maybe I am only seeing 1 side perspective, but the long term view only made me support israel more. 

>does Israel even wants to have a two state solution?

Yes they do, they have offered many such solutions to pallestine and all of them were rejected. Afaik, israel always wanted a  2 state solution, even from its creation. I believe its the pallestines which doesn't want a 2 state solution.

Bill clinton saying the pallestinians only had to recognise israel as a country to get their own state : https://youtu.be/SwH2zx93tMo?si=TKV9FWXQXMon-p0h


>Still attacking innocent people is highly condemnable. In such a complex situations, rather than supporting any side you should support the common people on both sides who have nothing to do with th situation.

I think majority of the pallestanian civilians don't want israel to exist. I don't think they hold the western ideology  and want peace. In my personal opinion, Hamas is only a brain child of this mentality.

>Condemn violence and support a two state state solution which is also India's official position.

I don't think a 2 state solution will work as long as pallestine doesn't want it. But I appreciate your neutral stance. Even though I think Israel is right on the israel-pallestine conflict, I think it has nothing to do with me. I think I shouldn't care or support either side.

Edit : but I agree with govt that we don't condemn not support a ceasefire on Gaza but condemn the occupation on the west bank."
"I hope so... but I am not sure... I mean after the Gandhi Family showed their support for Pallestanians,  I think their supporters will be supporting Pallestine too.

This is a behavior that I dont like about Indian Politics,  The people's believes are shaped by what the political party they want to win thinks.  It should have been the other way round, the political parties should have their goals modified based on what the people want. And this is not just for congress, I think all Indian Political parties influence what their supporters should think and do."
This is a very interesting point.
"What about the Hamas manifesto from 1988, which wants to wipe put Israel, then the rest of the Jews from Earth, then Christians, then everyone else? It's online, you can read it. Jews look European because they spent 2000 years there, after the Romans took over Jerusalem. They faced over a dozen pogroms, with Hitler's being the last one. They just came home and lots of Jews joined them, from India, North Africa, and other places they had escaped to long ago."
">You do realise Palestinians have been living under a lot of restrictions for decades?. 

Yes after the Arabs started a full scale war against israel and lost. And their continued refusal to accept israel as a state and their ambitions to destroy israel.


>Even to basic resources like water, right of movement, energy and education. What do you expect from them

To sign a 2 state solution and move on. But pallestanians don't want that, which is why it is under israel occupation.



>Violence is not a solution to this problem and unfortunately every single party involved in this conflict (including other nations) are interested in violence only.

I think violence is a solution. I think the half hearted measures of israel is one of the reason why the war is prelinging."
"I love how you give Pakistan as an example which has a crippled economy and military and not China.  


Let me know the time when pakistan entered india, took over most of it's territory, pushed the Indians out of their homes and forced them to live in dense inhumane conditions, while millions of them suffer due to lack of basic drinking water, food and healthcare?

You choosing Pakistan, which is hardly a threat, over China, who has been harassing us on much more borders for far worse and is a significant threat, just shows your mindset of fueling your anti muslim hate-boner here."
"Bro says ""apples and oranges"" then compares apples to ferraris. If you think some skirmishes on the border between India and Pakistan(2 nuclear powered nations) is in any way comparable to a global superpower fighting children who throw rocks, then you need to drop the Kool-aid."

">  What Nakba doesn't talk about is that there was a similar displacement of Jews from all the Arab nations surrounding israel.

 This coincides with the Zionist movement, If there was no zionist movement, ie taking Palestine for themselves, there would not be displacement of Jews.

And mind you most of the Jews in Israel are from the EU, again if you read my links you would understand it. Thats why DNA test is banned in Isreal.

>Israel controls many of the pallestanian land because the pallestanians don't agree for a 2 state solution. 

Do you know, The terms and conditions of 2 state solution put forward my Israel, There are many unresanable terms and conditions, if you look up you can find them. One of them is that Palestine should not have a military. Even without 2 state solution

>How did they get occupied to begin with? They got occupied when they lost the wars they initiated. It has nothing to do with Hamas as you stated.

Palestine was of Palestine, not Israeli, Israelis from the EU came and took citizens ship for Palestine. Then they started occupying land because of the zionist agenda. Palestine people started to fight for their own land. it's like saying Indians stated fighting against the Britishers. Are you this thick in head that you don't understand the chronology of the events.

British left Palestine with the UN they illegally gave land to Israel without the consent of the people of Palestine the native people.

Just think what if UN decide to give the whole of Northeast of India to China and Kasmir to Pakistan without the consent of the people of Kashmir or Noth East state. if then native people fight or India fights for it. they are called terrorist.

See how flawed your logic is.

&#x200B;

Now tell me. hamas raped and killed civilians, and they are called terrorists, Right, I agree.  
IDF also raped and killed civilians and also used children as human shields, but they are good guys in your book right. Keep your moral standard fixed. don't be biased.

Also, I will give you a solution for this conflict

Look at history.

For 1400 years Jews lived in arab nations peacefully under Islamic law, It stated in Islamic law that Jews could live and have their own religious law and follow them (ie Jewish courts and all)

So give land to Palestine and Jews live inside Palestine . as they have been living peacefully for the last 1400 years before the Zionist agenda.

Remember European Jew immigrants came to Palestine and applied for citizenship,

I do have answers for everything other than why israel is restristricting water. I am checking on that since I don't think that is fair.

"Of course I wouldn't be cool, the same way I am not cool with Indian government not providing us freedom of speech or not making the country secular. But that's the government Indian citizens elected for and I have to live with that choice as long as I am an Indian.

Same goes with Gaza, they elected a government. the actions of the government, whether they individually agree with or not is irrelevant, will have repurcurssions.

So to bring it to same context, if Indian military uses me or my family as a human shields and if china or pakistan attacks us resulting in us being dead, I wouldnt be blaming Pakistan and China for attacking. I would be blaming our govt and the military for using us as shields."
I would leave my house and let them carpet bomb it.

How taking the land of people is ok? and continuing to do so for the last 75 years is also ok.

"Yes like 2-3 thousand years ago. And even at that time jews were not the sole occupants of the land. Arabs, Persians had been living there too.

Britishers created another mess because that's what they do."

"

> Israel (as the state it is now full of mostly immigrants) was never a part of the Levant.

Actually the Jews were the the indegenious people of the land. Israel existed even before the Muslim religion existed. They were displaced by Arab and Roman forces.

>Pakistan separated from India while India gained Independence. 

Yes the land was divided into 2 during independence.



>Israel is a colonizer trying to force a weaker population into submission. 

No, both Arabs and Jews were under the British rule. They had migrated to that location during the British rule. They wanted to go back to their homeland. And so they went with the blessings of the british.

After british left and provided independence, then Since the Arabs wanted to displace Jews again, conflict broke out. At which point UN partitioned the land into israel and pallestine.

Both Israelites and pallestanians were colonized by the british, they were provided independence together. And then it was divided into 2 countries, same as india pakistan."
">Ohhh right. So any kill by Israel on innocents is done in good faith while any retaliation from Palestine is inexcusable? 

I think you got it the other way round. All the wars was initiate by the Arabs and israel has always retaliated.  

Regarding what is excusible and not depends on what is targeted. Pallestanians/Hamas, targeted civilians and some police/military died, this is inexcusable. Israel is targeting the Hamas and don't care (to some level) whether Hamas is using civilians as shield. This is acceptable since the target is the military.

>So Hamas is hiding behind civilians, out of which 11,000+ have died since Oct 7th, while Hamas is perfectly fine, still operating as strong as ever. Seems to me Israel has really shitty aim or they don't just care, bomb everything that moves. 

Idk how many civilians died, but Hamas is not perfectly fine. They just requested ceasefire for few days in exchange of some hostages, which israel is considering. Additionally many Hamas leaders has already been killed. I don't know the number of Hamas foot soldiers which were killed.

>Lol ""strategy to create victims"", it's not like mainstream media is all under Israel's influence and even makes up blatant lies like the 40 decapitated babies. 

I don't know what this is about,  but I have a feeling there is more to the story or is fake story. Based on how israel is handling the situation in Gaza. If they wanted to commit genocide, they have the ability and power to wipe out Gaza in a day. They are taking half measures considering the civilians.


>How about I kicked you out of your own house, then offer you 20% of your house back as a peaceful solution? You aren't allowed to retaliate, you should be fine with it or you are a terrorist. Does it sound good and fair?

Jews and Muslims have been coexisting in the region, for the most part peacefully, since Islam was first born in the seventh century.

The conflict did not really begin until the early 20th century, as thousands of Jews left Europe to escape persecution and establish a homeland in what they call today Israel, and they did so by displacing the native population."

Of course you don't know. Mainstream media publicly stated that Palestinians have decaptitated 40 babies and raped women , and news sources quickly retracted the statement, saying it was false and FABRICATED. Look it up. Your knowledge of this is embarrassingly superficial. 

Yes, of course they can wipe out Gaza in a day. But they won't because they want the territory to themselves, and essentially, they would be wiping out the thing they want themselves. Also, their terrorism would become obvious to the world. They need the PR. They're taking half measure in the manner of a slow poison, like the animals they are. 

>I hope you realise that Israel existed even before Islam as a religion existed. Are you sure you want to pull on the strings of who kicked who off and who the whole region should belong to?

You know there are palestinian christians and jews too, right? Islam is not even half the story here. You should have realized by now that no one arguing jews shouldn't live there. The region belongs to semites: jews, christians and muslims. Not zionists, who are pretty much Europeans."
"Lmao all the israelis living there aren't even Israelis by blood. They are europeans. The palestinians are more semitic than the occupying zionists. And this is not even opinion. If you knew your history, which I highly doubt, then you would know both arabs and jews are semetic. Both biologically are descendents of Abraham.  Both have equal right to the land. Zionists do not. Not even orthodox jews support Israel. Zionists do not even follow Judaism correctly. 

Don't give me that instagram shit. All the mainstream media supports Israel. You obviously swallow whatever it shoves down your throat like the sheep you are."
So? It was thousands of years ago.
">Palestinian Jews exist, Palestine is made of muslims, christians and jews.

Yes under the british rule it was, I didnt deny it.  Its during the british rule that the majority of the  jews migrated to pallestine.

>Jews and Muslims have been coexisting in the region, for the most part peacefully, since Islam was first born in the seventh century.

Islam itself talks about how their prophet engaged in a war with the jews. There are many such instances throughout history against jews. I do agree that there has been a rise in anti-semitism within Arab countries  post the 20th century. That is the time when the Arab countries became powerful - with the discovery of oil in the area. But before that it was not all nice things with the muslims. It was better than Europe, but by no means peaceful in today's standard.

&#x200B;

>The conflict did not really begin until the early 20th century, as thousands of Jews left Europe to escape persecution and establish a homeland in what they call today Israel, and they did so by displacing the native population.

There are tonnes of Progroms which occured with the  jews outside this region from the islamic states before the Israel was created in the 20th century. But yes I agree that the Arabs didnt like jews comming back to Jew's homeland and was violent because of this too.

Also when talking about the native poppulation, you cant just start from the middle and call the people at the point you start as the native poppulation.  As mentioned previously, Israel existed way before muslims ever existed. They are the natives of the land. They were displaced by the Arabs  (and the Romans) and went to rest of the world including Europ. And after they got displaced from Europe, they found a way to return back to their native land. where people are talking about displacing them again. Where exactly should the Jews be going(assuming that they will)?

Its not just the Arab's to keep. If only 1 community can claim it, Israel has a bigger claim as they are the native people. If you need to find someone else other than the jews to have a bigger ownership, then you need to find who lived in that area before the Jews."
">So the occupying nation is the one retaliating? Say it out loud once so that you fathom it better.

Yes the occupying nation is the one retaliating. Did you ever wonder why they are occupying? It was a response to all the wars that was initiated by the Arabs.

>So you admit to being poorly educated on the casualties. I mean, of course you are, it's not a surprise.

Yes I admit, I dont keep a track of it, I didnt keep a track of how many Israelis died either.  I dont care about how many died. Even if 1 died, its too much. but that is not the basis of our discussion here. Our discussion was whether hamas is effected and I told you many hamas leaders has already been killed. Both inside and outside Palestine.

&#x200B;

>, Israel rejected the hostages. What do you make of that? This reply of yours is very vague. You seem indecisive.

Based on what little I know, Israel is worried that their efforts to squash the Hamas will be undone if a break is given.  A break means Hamas can regroup and re-organize and pull a new attack.

Is it the best action, i dont know,  I dont know how the israeli government is going to tell to the family of the victims that they are not going to stop the attack to save the victims.

It is the same ideology as ""we dont negotiate with the terrorist"" Because you dont know whether the terrorist is as honourable as you.

&#x200B;

>Of course you don't know. Mainstream media publicly stated that Palestinians have decaptitated 40 babies and raped women , and news sources quickly retracted the statement, saying it was false and FABRICATED. Look it up. Your knowledge of this is embarrassingly superficial.

Lol, you are believing them when they said it happend, but when the same guys say it was reported incorrectly you dont believe them. Are you sure you are not biased?

&#x200B;

>Yes, of course they can wipe out Gaza in a day. But they won't because they want the territory to themselves, and essentially, they would be wiping out the thing they want themselves. Also, their terrorism would become obvious to the world. They need the PR. They're taking half measure in the manner of a slow poison, like the animals they are.

They dont want it for themselves.  If they did why did they completely pull out of Gaza in 2005? They had enough and pulled out. But now chances are that they wont let Gaza govern itself.

&#x200B;

>You know there are palestinian christians and jews too, right? Islam is not even half the story here. You should have realized by now that no one arguing jews shouldn't live there. The region belongs to semites: jews, christians and muslims. Not zionists, who are pretty much Europeans.

Again wrong, Israel has offered many times a 2 state solution. if you dont want to believe israel sources, there is one where clinton is saying 2 state solution is not possible because pallestine rejected the best offer they could get- whole of gaza and 97% of west bank as long as they accept israel as a state.

Additionally, as per the poll by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, about 60% of the pallestanians dont want a 2 state solution. So the people who are supporting israel is basically saying Israel shouldnt exist. They  (both the palestanian leaders and the civilians) are literally telling Israel and the world  that if they get freedom they will invade Israel. It is only a matter of time."
"Bud your statements are straight from Instagram. I know your type. Don't try to whitewash terrorism. Palestinians voted for Hamas, but they are semitic according to you. Great one.

Following this logic, go jump in a pond because India then belongs to the Tribal adivasi communities and not the other hindu-muslim-christian communities present now. But you're not willing to do that, 

If you're gonna follow that idiotic logic, we all should just commit mass-seppuku since the world belongs to monkeys as they were here before us."
"Would it surprise you to read that Israelis are neck-and-neck with the people of Palestine, in their lack of support for the 2 state solution- the support levels are just 33 % on one side and 35 % on the other.

*""Some 67% of Palestinians oppose the two-state solution, citing settlement expansion as a key reason for their scepticism. Plus a growing dissent against the lack of implementation of the Oslo Accords ‚Äì a pair of agreements signed in 1993 to ensure the ""right of the Palestinian people to self-determination"" ‚Äì and Israel‚Äôs use of coercion in the occupied territories has only made matters worse.""*

&#x200B;

And on the side of the ""good""

*""According to the Pew Research Center's survey, a growing number of Israelis are beginning to doubt the feasibility of a two-state solution, with only 35% of respondents believing that a peaceful coexistence between Israel and Palestine can be achieved.""*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And before you say, the surveyed  Israelis are just revolted by the massacres of October -

""*The survey was, however, conducted in April and published in September, before the Israel-Hamas war erupted following an unprecedented attack on October 7.""*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And realistically, what is the solution here ? One side has the support of the world and also has the heavy weapons of a militarised nation - is the weaker side just meant to follow the suggestion of the hospitalised alien in Independence Day ? ( the 1996 movie )

Congratulations on being older. That just shows your ignorance has survived longer than I have. You seem to be on reddit and instagram a lot for being an older guy. How about you get a job and move out of your parents' basement instead of arguing with kids, sir. 

>And let me guess you are of Abrahamic faith and I know which one.

And let me guess, you aren't of any abrahamic faith. I know which one. Which makes your opinions on this pretty worthless."
">See, your anti-muslim bigotry is showing.

I dont consider stating what is written in islamic texts as islamic bigotry. Also stating a second reason on why there was a rise in anti-semitism from the arab nations is not bigotry.

But I am an Islamaphobic. This is because there are many instances of brutality made by the Islamic group because of their religion. Not sure whether it is phobia when the danger is real, but when they learn to become tolerant, I will leave my reasonable phobia.  

When ""Gustakh-e-Rasool ki ek hee saza"" is not ""Sar tan se juda"" and when ""la illa illa"" is not just  ""Allah"". Then I will remove my phobia.

&#x200B;

>Following this logic, go jump in a pond because India then belongs to the Tribal adivasi communities and not the other hindu-muslim-christian communities present now. But you're not willing to do that,

You make big assumptions of me. I am an aethis, I am only phobic of the Islam. I dont care whether India recognizes itself based on its adivasi history or chirsitan history or jain history or hindu history. None of it matter, what matters is what we do today.

&#x200B;

>If you're gonna follow that idiotic logic, we all should just commit mass-seppuku since the world belongs to monkeys as they were here before us.

It was your first point that Arabs were the natives of the land and  its not fair that they were asked to share. I disagree with this, history of whose land it was doesnt matter. What matters is who all are there... now.

I agree with the last statement you made where 2 nation theory is ideal.  I agree with that, but Pallestanians dont want it."

&#x200B;

>Arab literally means 'desert dweller', but I can see according to your blind hate, you cannot imagine arab being natives of the desert of Jerusalem.

Good to know, but Israel was not a desert to begin with. It became a desert due to deforestation, which israel reverting back. So yh, Arab- desert dweller doesnt make them native to that region.

But incase you didnt know, Philistine (Today's Pallestine) was the name the Roman emperor gave Judea (land of the jews) after he defeated Judea in war to insult the jews. What does Pallestine/philistine mean?  It means the native of philistia aka Jews."

But street thugs in Brazil are all mini cartels. And entire south america has some cartels.
"about which country? now you have said so I'd like to state my reasons.

north korea- dictatorship, no freedom of speech. I'd be sh\*t scared if I offend someone there due to my hairstyle or something and get executed.

iran- recently they were killing women for showing hair and those who protested against them.

iraq, syria, libya, sudan- war torn

afg- taliban r\*ped a women pilot in public recently and people watched coz she was woman

israel, palestine, russia, ukaraine- at war currently.

bangladesh- extremely poor, mugging is very common and they find innovative ways too.

Pakistan- coz I'm an Indian."

"No, it isn't."
"Yes, according to what I have seen in random short documentaries and cartel violence videos. On BBC news as well..It's crime rate is among top 5 I guess..These drug cartels are inhuman"
Yes it is dangerous. I have heard ppl carry fake wallets in case they get mugged. Favellas are mostly controlled by gangs and foreigners are not allowed anywhere near their territory. There‚Äôs a youtuber named kurt kaz  who has connections to such gang controlled places and uploads vlogs

"You are correct in pointing out that the Democratic Republic of the Congo does not reflect the aspiration for democracy, they have faced civil wars, political corruption, and human rights abuses, which have hindered its democratic progress."
Atrocities that the cartels commit
"True, but imo it's entire appeal is ""if you have money, you can do anything"". A rich man's playground, more than most other countries. This place has no 'village' or 'seaside' that is far from civilization, no cultural identity to speak of, everything is artificial. That's why you can't even find a corner to enjoy where there is less exploitation, unlike other countries. It is only a place for spending money, not earning it or actually living in."
So it doesn't have airports?
I am sorry but I literally stated that.. what exactly is so confusing?
"a load of bullshit... a simple google search would tell you jews were driven out under roman rule, it as in 132 CE and prophet PBUH was born **500 years** after that LMAOO if anything it was the christians doing that, the fact you accuse me of not knowing history when infact it's you who has no idea what the bs you are spewing.

>Why should the Arabs make peace? If I was an Arab leader I would never make terms with Israel. That is natural: we have taken their country. Sure, God promised it to us, but what does that matter to them? Our God is not theirs. We come from Israel, it's true, but two thousand years ago, and what is that to them? There has been anti-Semitism the Nazis, Hitler, Auschwitz, but was that their fault? They only see one thing: we have come here and stolen their country. Why should they accept that?

This is not me saying, this is the literal founder of Israel, Ben Gurion saying that, but yeah ofc I am the one who does not know anything right

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David\_Ben-Gurion#:\~:text=Why%20should%20the,they%20accept%20that%3F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ben-Gurion#:~:text=Why%20should%20the,they%20accept%20that%3F)

Besides jews were running from europe coz they were being persecuted by Christians there, where did the holocaust happen again? at the hands of whom? white european christians

seems like someone slept through their history lesson

>You do understand the land of Israel was granted after the UN mandate, so you're literally saying UN is wrong

1 you are naive if you think UN ever works, it's just there for western powers and listen to their demands, coz why else do 5 nations have the veto power? where is democracy?

2 why should Palestinians be forced to give up more than half of their lands to their colonisers? would you fine sharing more than half of indian subcontinent with britishers?

3 Israel has **constantly** broken the UN agreement and taken over west bank and it's settlers have been constantly settling in the West Bank area of Palestine

Lastly, stop bootlicking israel just coz u hate muslims, you know israelis are extremely racist to Indians and call us all ""cow slaves"" ""urine drinkers"" ""drowned in cow excrement""

and they have started taking over our country too, there is mini Israel in himachal pradesh where ***Indians are not allowed!***

*Can you believe indians not being allowed in India????*"

It can't be a coincidence atleast khazakastan is a normal country Afghanistan bro why would anyone go there."
"i agree. qatar is just barren dessert with dust storms for as far as you can see. the only thing working for the oil countries is their oil ofc! there trying to amp up tourism and tech. but, their policies and culture are shite! no rights for women! no path to citizenship for long time foreign residents. they basically want you to come, work your ass off and give them your prime years and then leave. i remember my lead being offered a promotion and a big paycheck to relocate to Qatar. He was really excited but then declined the offer. He got to know women weren‚Äôt allowed outside without the permission and company of a male guardian. They cannot marry without the permission of a male guardian. Also, they cannot even go out with a burqa!

For foreign workers there was some leniency but he still didn‚Äôt wanna stay in such backward place claiming to be forward!"

"Atleast you agree Jews have a more historical right to Israel then Palestinians. Good you do research, now I know more, thanks for that, thank God I didn't had to go looking for it üôÇ. Gonna use that point from now on. 

1. Just because you don't like UN doesn't make it any more less legitimate. Even Palestine accepts it. Yes UN is basically a more sanitary way of doing what big countries wanna, but guess what I am fine with that. Cause I don't live in Palestine.

2. You do know british did partitioned Indian Subcontinent into parts on the same year as Palestine and Israel was taking shape. So I don't know what you're talking about.

3. Yes after the first war, but then again it's the Arab world whos the stupid once here, they thought they could win, but lost badly multiple wars, it's called conquest by war, something which most countries actually recognise. Infact most of the human history and these are made by conquest, Israel is just the one that happening after all the major conquest have already been done.

Lastly, I am sure Israels are racist, cause everybody are i am racist too, but atleast they wouldn't kill me for worshipping some idol, just coz I hate muslims, bro i live in North India, you don't ask me what is our relationship with muslims, it's not good, no matter what somebody says, they all know the reality of what happened. Muslims haven't even done a reparation, that could be done very easily, but the same reason Iran still wanna fight Israel, is the same reason peace will never happen in India, coz the mentality will never die. I kinda like what Palestine are doing, cause that's what happened to my ancestors at some point of time for 800-1000 year. So all the more power to them, they gonna be racist I am fine with that, since I am not gonna move their anytime soon anyway. 

Bro talks about mini Israel in India, when there many mini Pakistans in India, who actively tell us, we gonna kill you on top of their lungs. Who do you think I would be afraid of more, you guessed it. SMH"

Funny!!! US consulate or for that matter any country consulates have all travel records available. US also check previous passports in case of doubts. We no longer live in Stone Age. Every thing is well connected. At departures and arrivals immigration counters also has all records which they get upon swiping the passport.

I came here just for couple of years but fall in love with the food, culture and the country. Having Mexican girlfriend also plays a part as well. I'm happy here getting lifestyle of US without the gun culture and racism of US.  
Also Indians flock to different countries, live in Indian communities, eat Indian food and talk in Native languages without mixing with locals. Which I have been actively trying to avoid.  
Food is great and lots of choices being an international cosmopolitan city. Lots of events and concerts, groups and activities and lots of beautiful places to visit."
So can Pakistanis call india occupied as per your logic?
"It has not been occupied illegally tho. As much as people regret it and wish it had never happened, we cannot claim it."
"Over 15 million people migrated between India and Pakistan. Over 2 million people died, both Muslims and Hindus. 

It is not occupied land. It rightfully belongs to both Indians and Pakistanis.

You are extremely uneducated"
"I'm glad Mexico is gay inclusive! I would love to see an India where I can be openly gay one day (She still has a long way to go). Btw, what made you come to Mexico specifically? Was it work?"
No
Tell that to people who were forced to leave and you call me uneducated
"India needs almost 20-30 years to make homosexuality socially accepted. India didn't get on the train of the sexual revolution which happened all around the world and we are very conservative society. One mold fits all kind of.

Cool man! It was great getting to know something new about Mexico! Maybe it's high time I overcome my fear and visit Mexico one day!
"People were asked about their religion and forced to leave to save life. Older generation still long to walk the streets, see the house that was once theirs. House gone but the street remains to be seen on Google maps satellite view. It‚Äôs beyond cruel"
Not true
Sure. You won't regret it
"Why does that not make you even more of a Palestinian supporter? When you know how hard it is for pwople who have to leave their homes and ancestral properties,    once again it's your Islamophobia showing

Besides this happened on both sides, you think muslims living in here didn't leave/had to leave their houses to go to the other side of the border? Then you are just a shame since you don't even know about partition, such a recent history which has shaped our subcontinent todaya"
Lmao a blatant lie get educated first
You can‚Äôt label anyone not supporting Palestine Islamophobia. Most of the western world supports Israel because Hamas attacked them first. How can you justify terrorism of Hamas on innocent people on 7th?
Share links to prove your point
"Hamas attacked them first? Congrata you've fallen to propaganda of westwrn media, no it did not start on oct 7, it started in 1948 with nakba

You asked me for proof right? I can provide you with countless evidence to support my claim. Will you then change your opinion and stand for palestine?"
"Can‚Äôt justify terrorism on 7th with what happened in past since 1948. We are both Indian citizens we should support official stand of government of India. They know better, they got intelligence from raw and our diplomats and friends in western world. Both of us never been to Palestine we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs really going on there anyway."
Still if you have anything you can share
"If you think Hamas are terrorist, then you have no right to call our revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh, Chandrasekhar Azad, BK Dutt, etc. Call them terrorists too

It's seriously extremely disheartening Indians who went thru 200 years of brutal colonisation stand with white europeans who colonised us in the first place.

>We are both Indian citizens we should support official stand of government of India.

This is not dictatorship. India is a democracy. Every one is free and entitled to their opinion, no one is forced to agree with the government. Instead, democracy guarantees you the right to disagree and question the government.

Btw India refused to recognise Israel in 1948 coz that time Indian government had morals, we were just fresh off colonisation and we knew better than to stand with colonisers that time.

And the current Indian stance the government has  taken is only coz of India's interest, but it does not make it a moral stance per se.

Russia declared a war in Ukraine and attacked it for no reason, but India did not condemn Russia coz Indian government's priority was India's interest since Russia has been a loyal friend to India. But does that make our government's stance as moral? ofcourse absolutely not

>Both of us never been to Palestine we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs really going on there anyway.

By this logic, the world should not have supported India, South Africa when they were fighting for their freedom coz *""wE hAVen'T BeeN thErE, sO We dON't kNOw wHaT's gOInG oN rIGhT?""*

And I promise I'll get you back to you with sources, I am just a little busy rn

Tbh there is just so much evidence supporting my claim, I can absolutely bombard you with all of that, but I don't wanna overwhelm you with so much since it would just turn you away so I do not understand which ones to share with you"

"That all land between Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea belongs to Palestine. So, basically they mean that the Israeli state must be dismantled."
"""From the river to the sea"" echoes a call for single Palestinian state on the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. It is being labelled as an ""anti-semitic"" slogan because it implicitly denies the existence of Israel."
It‚Äôs a code word for ‚Äòdestroy Israel‚Äô.
It literally means they don't accept Israel as a country.
"It means they want jews dead, ""from the river to the sea"" is unequivocally a genocide call."
River of kafir's blood to the ocean of kafir's dead bodies.
"the full slogan is ""from the river to the sea, palestine will be free"", i.e. it advocates for palestinian freedom and self-determination from the mediterranean sea to the jordan river."
It means they want to destroy the Jewish nation and ethnic cleanse the Jews living there.
Like a Pakistani saying from Hindukush to the Bay of Bengal.

"Idts it has any serious meaning except for the free and see being rhyming.
 
That said, why do we care about israel/palestine?"
"
‚Äú‚ÄùFrom the river to the sea‚Äù is a rejoinder to the fragmentation of Palestinian land and people by Israeli occupation and discrimination. Palestinians have been divided in a myriad of ways by Israeli policy. There are Palestinian refugees denied repatriation because of discriminatory Israeli laws. There are Palestinians denied equal rights living within Israel‚Äôs internationally recognized territory as second-class citizens. There are Palestinians living with no citizenship rights under Israeli military occupation in the West Bank. There are Palestinians in legal limbo in occupied Jerusalem and facing expulsion. There are Palestinians in Gaza living under an Israeli siege. All of them suffer from a range of policies in a singular system of discrimination and apartheid‚Äîa system that can only be challenged by their unified opposition. All of them have a right to live freely in the land from the river to the sea.‚Äù


https://jewishcurrents.org/what-does-from-the-river-to-the-sea-really-mean"
It means an apartheid free state where palestinians can  vote and all palestenians are equal under the law.
It means all israeli land should be palestinian land. But most people pretend it means kill the jews because palestinians are muslims and brown and its convenient to paint them as the villains.
"Damn, a lot of shitty answers here. 

please use the replies to your post as an example as to why you should not take answers in isolation and as a source of truth. I have learnt this the hard way.  Anyways to answer your q, see below


>Historically the slogan ‚Äúfrom the river to the sea‚Äù dates at least as far back as the 1960s when the Palestinian resistance was led by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), a secular coalition of Palestinian nationalist and leftist parties.  
>  
>In the late 1960s, the PLO put forward a visionary idea of Arab-Jewish coexistence in one democracy, arguing for Israel and the Occupied Territories to become ‚Äúone secular, democratic state of Palestine‚Äù based on one person, one vote, where Arabs, Jews, Muslims and Christians would enjoy full equality.  
>  
>In 1969 the PLO had formally declared its goal ‚Äúto establish a free and democratic society in Palestine for all Palestinians whether they are Muslims, Christians or Jews‚Äù. The idea was revolutionary at the time, an implicit challenge to the Arab regimes in the region that were neither free nor democratic. It was also revolutionary in making an offer to share the land as equal citizens with the people who had driven the Palestinians from their land and placed them under military occupation.

[Source](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/10/29/23926878/river-sea-palestine-free-israel-hamas-war-protest-gaza)

If you look at the this [article,](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/10/29/23926878/river-sea-palestine-free-israel-hamas-war-protest-gaza) Hamas adopts this slogan in the 1980s, which captures the meaning that you are alluding to and can have an **anti-Semitic interpretation**.

In summary, there are multiple interpretations of this slogan."
"Originally it meant that palestine should be the nation and not israel..

Arabs were almost 80 percent of the population of Palestine.

In 19th century world saw the rise of Zionism and Jews from Europe started emigrating to palestine. 

Jews faced hostilities in Europe and had faced numerous expulsions. Poland was one area where they relatively fared better but once Poland went under Russian rule it witnessed many Jewish pogroms. This further pushed Jewish immigration to Palestine. 

In 1918 Great Britain created the Balfour declaration , that is the commitment to create a Jewish nation in palestine. But naturally this pissed off the Arabs. 

In 1948 the British left and israel immediately faced war. The Palestinians were banished from Israeli land (called the Nakba) . Simultaneously Jews were expelled from other Arab nations such as Egypt , Iraq etc. this started a long cycle of oppression from israel on palestinians and resulting violence from palestinians and so on. 

The slogan originally meant that from the river Jordan till the Mediterranean sea palestine will be the nation and israel , created by Britain will be removed. 

In the 21st century Israel has gone hard right wing (as in genocidal songs , segregationist policies, Jewish settlers/colonialists taking over palestinian homes  etc.) 

This has been condemned by UN , European nations , vehemently opposed by Africans, Irish and Indians (those who have seen colonialism and segregation). This has also helped fuel Hamas because it is able to say that look Israel is evil and hence our violence is justified . 

Currently largely the slogan means that the Palestinians in Gaza and West Bank should get human rights and dignity, something that Israel has increasingly taken away. Though I am sure there will be a lage number of people who would want to see only Palestine and not israel (that is reject a two state solution)"
OP seems retarded
"israel colonized palestine, stole their home and killed their babies"
All of the comments saying river to sea means genocide of jews is so wrong jews all over the world saying not in our name isreal is doing authrocity in the name of jews take some time out and look the campaign not in our name you get this fight isn't about Arab vs jews / it's about zionist vs palestine resistance
Bruh you can google such simple questions
They want all the jews to be thrown in either of those water bodies in the slogan.
Illegal state is European colony on Palestine land similar Bharat was British colony before 1947.
"Wrong, the slogan that Arabs are accustomed to is actually ""from the river to the see, Palestine will be Arab"", what we know is a just English euphemism therefore, it is anti-Semitic."
It cannot be Arabs semit people too.
Does the British Empire have a right to exist in India?
What happens to innocent Israel people
No it isnt. funny considering israel is practising genocide right now.
[deleted]
They can prosper in Jewish state in Europe.
Bharat was colonized too and illegal state on Palestine land is last remaining European colony in Asia.
That's great but it's nothing to do with the slogan.
"No. Arab Israelis already have full voting rights and representation in the parliament (Knesset). Palestinians don't because they are a separate nationality, not Israelis."
You're asking brown people.
Why Arab nations started all this mess? Now I have a solution. Arab nations can all come forward and agree to leave at peace. Hamas like organisations immediately lose support and they surrender. Moreover Palestine population including Israel Jews and Arabs they all get all rights in all Arab nations. Problem solved.
For asking a genuine question?
Projecting
Now don‚Äôt call me fascist for stating the truth that Hamas attacked innocent Israel people on 7 th. How can anyone justify terrorism with some made up history.
Google won‚Äôt give opinion
Its literally written in their holy book to kill all Jews. The so called ‚Äôsupport‚Äô rallies are just an excuse for vile creatures to spew hatred and chant ‚ÄòKill all Jews‚Äô whilst the police and so called liberals do nothing.
They can create their Jewish state in Europe.
You made that up

"They want them killed or deported to the countries they came from. The actual fact is they came not only from Europe but also many Muslim nations where they were persecuted. So, it's supporting genocide of Jews in a way. That's what the Jews believe. Hitler also worked closely with the Palestinian ruler who supported killing of Jews according to what Benjamin Netanyahu said. So you know why Jews have no choice but to defend themselves."
Nobody actually required to serve in military from birth so all got blood in their hands.
Better kill than be killed.
So genocide is okay as long as it's of a group backed by white supremacist?ü§†
Palestinians Arabs have better chance at assimilating in other 22 something odd Arab countries than jews have in Europe.
That will be the case of Jewish state is in Germany.
What am i asking?

I don't think that's true but at the same time hatred for jews is definetly rooted in the islamic religion and it's histography.

Jews are seen as traitors because islamic accounts say that they were treated well under Caliphate, but that wouldn't necessarily be true as maimonedes himself has lamented being living amongst Arabs.

Lol who said? Don't push your own believes on to other. 

Dharma is just a duty. Duty of a mother, father brother,sister,soldier,banker etc. It's the dharma of a mother to lie to her children if the truth scars the children for life (for example telling a Jewish child that there are people out there who wouldn't hesitate to put the child in an oven and turn it on). That is not adharma. Dharma is the balance of life.

What do you mean? He literally promotes religion extremism.
"Do you think it's possible? You can guess from the answers above. Israel has flaws too but it's war. If Israel drops it's weapons today, there will be no Jews there .

No we are talking about Israel Hamas situation. I think what he meant is that some of the people who support Hamas are extremists
And how does that prove they aided hitler in any way?
Yeah what funding do they have? Everything in Gaza from books to water is controlled by Israel coz it‚Äôs nothing but open air prison. Why does any religion needs a country? That is a BS antiquated thought. And if anyone owes the land to Jewish people to form a country it is Europe who literally massacred them. England does not get to say go to that nice looking coastal area in Middle East and form your country there and kick out whoever is there. I ask you this again how will you feel if you had nothing to do with some religion and those people kick you out of your own land.
Israel gets trillions of dollars in military aid from countries like US and England. Israel has one of the most sophisticated army in the world and biggest buyer of bombs and other arms. Are we seriously comparing this to a rebellion group formed in occupied land.
"‚ÄúDespite pleas from the United Nations and human rights groups, Israel has maintained a land, air and sea blockade on Gaza since 2007 that has had a devastating effect on Palestinian civilians. Israel says the blockade, which gives it control of Gaza's borders and is also enforced by Egypt, is necessary to protect Israeli citizens from Hamas.‚Äù

Please educate yourself about the land before you speak on them. You are advocating for oppressors and colonial settlers. While you celebrate your country‚Äôs freedom from British every year."
"PLO wants complete extermination of Jews ? 
Who is spreading this propaganda ?"
"Tell that to the people protesting against Israeli under the guise of supporting Palestinian. Literally all these so called protests include ‚Äòkill the jews chants‚Äô. Nowadays its not even limited to rallies; trains, busses, random mobs all openly issuing death threats.  You can write all the progressive bull here but out there billions of muslims believe in violence.
Imagine a protest against muslims where anyone chants ‚Äòkill the muslims‚Äô. That protest would end in every single protester beheaded and entire city in flames. So much for peaceful."

1. There are Jewish only settlements where Arab Israeli's are not allowed to buy land. Jews can get land anywhere
2. Settlements that are stolen from Palestenian territories can only be handed over to Jews
3. Weddings between Jews and Arabs are actually illegal!
4. If 2 adults have consensual sex, and one of them is a Jew and the other is a Palestenian, the Jew is allowed to ""withdraw consent"" after sex was completed and the Palestinian will be convicted as a rapist.
5. Black Jew women are sterilized by the government non-consensually
6. Any Jew can get immediate Israeli citizenship, No Arab civilian who was kicked out during the war is allowed to return
7. Half of the population in Israel is Palestenian, yet they cannot vote in the elections and have no say in the courts. The only courts allowed legally are Israeli courts.

">You know, experts of the subject, they will decide and they also give evidences. Widespread indiscriminate vigilante violence is not confined in Islam 

Who decides who these experts are?  A terrorist would be referring to people he calls an expert before indulging in violence. If you are incapable of identifying what is written to be right or wrong, you shouldn't be following with 100% conviction what an expert says. 

Btw this is not just for Islam, same goes for Hinduism as well. This is what I told my parents when I learned a bit of gita.

If I have questions, I can ask experts for clarity, but if the time is not present in a text, it is open for interpretation. It can be now, in the future or the end of days. And no matter when, violence is violence.

>You can check out the chapter and the hadiths before and after. 

Before asking a non believer to read and learn the writing of Islam, the followers of Islam should really inspire people to learn.  

When I see mobs of muslims chanting sar tan se juda slogan and la illa illa Allah and such, when majority of the terrorists who kill a tonne come from the same religion,  there does seem like something is wrong with the underlying religion. 

But yes I may take a look at the hadith more than that single line. Which was qouted earlier."
"regardless of what you say, israel is the oppressor and palestine the oppressed and they are granted freedom of resistance in anyway by UN."
huh??? israeli settlers are the ones literally illegally occupying and invading palestine and creating illegal settlements by evicting palestinians from their own homes and lands
"how is asking freedom for palestinians genocidal? when all we are saying is **palestine will be free**, and not ""death to jews"" ""stone jews"" ""gas jews"" or any such thing.... while on the other hand, israel's pm is revising history, making hitler, the one who murdered 6 million jews seem like the good guy, wearing the yellow star used to segregate jews in nazi germany proudly, who's the real anti semitic here?

saying palestine will be free is genocide call while actual genocide calls are not genocide calls???????? make it make sense"
You are the biggest dumbass I have seen on internet today
"Naah, the Jews deserve their state. It is same as wanting genocide of Jews lol. As they were killed in iraq, morocco and you can see how Palestinian leader made his statements. I condemn killing innocent citizens but they are collaterals of war. Hamas has targeted kids deliberately. There's a difference."
I am Hindu myself and I fully acknowledge extremism exists in every religion on earth. This is the easiest example I can think of to show you what Hindu extremism looks like: https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-man-accused-of-carrying-beef-beaten-to-death/story-3fuowiHpgloxAbERlouZ4M_amp.html
"In every field there are experts. Not everyone can do their own medical research for example. Half knowledge is more dangerous than no knowledge. Terrorists are doing so only because they have half knowledge. If you were even a little bit unbiased, you would see how many books and campaigns mainstream Muslim scholars have done against terrorists.

It's also completed non factual that majority of terrorists are Muslim. You only hear about their news more. There are many other conflicts going on in the world without Islam as the cause and their fatality figures are much higher."
Please have a read of my statements. Nothing I've said suggests I believe the Palestinians don't deserve a homeland or that Israel is faultless
"No one asked them to reject peace treaty 7 times. Arabs attacked israel first with the intention of throwing jews into the sea. They should have been prepared for the same treatment atleast. Also, israel only funded the initial organisation of Hamas when they promised peace. But later that organisation started a more radical version of Hamas. Please get your facts right. You hate Jews coz they are cursed(according to skybook). The  Jews of 7th century have no relation with the Jews here right now. If you are right in hating them, they are right in killing Palestinian children. And the land belongs to Jews as much as Palestinians. No one asked Hamas to hide behind children and women. There's collateral in every war. They aren't targeting Palestinian children like Hamas targeted Israeli children."
"Perhaps you don't know how dogwhistles work, at first Nazis too were more adamant on proving that jews are lazy and greedy but their motive was ethnic cleansing.

Why couldn't the slogan be ""from the river to the sea, Arabs and jews may live in Israel peacefully"" or something like that?"
They're literally correct. Check where Netanyahu actually is from and what his real name is.
Why don‚Äôt you give up your land to form Jewish state darling if you care that much?
Why would someone want to beat another person to death? That‚Äôs so wrong

This is infact wrong, wanting palestine's liberation =/= genocide of jews

Pro palestine sentiment is never about hating on jews or judaism, it's all about being against zionism and it's hateful ideology"
">If you are right in hating them, they are right in killing Palestinian children

yeah you think killing innocent kids is right, I am not gonna waste my time proving my argument to a hate filled bigot like you"
"coz arabs and jews aren't mutually exclusive, that's literally basic common sense....

arab= ethnicity

jews= religion"
"We have no right to ask children of Muslim invaders to leave India, or do we? Zionist movement was much less violent than the invasions.

Not just that, this land is the ancient homeland of Jewish people, that is undisputable. It is not some random land where they came and set up tent.

They were dispersed, by Muslim invasions there, and now they returned to the land."
"Jews have been residents of Israel for several millenia before Islam was even born. The Arabs Muslims outnumbered Jews, but that does not mean that Jews lost all their rights. Considering that systematic oppression Jews faced in several Muslim majority countries, it's obvious why they are seeking to return back to their original Semitic lands."
Coz religious extremism or hate for other‚Äôs religion is a hell of mental illness
"Out of interest, what is the practical route to the creation of Palestine?"
"Says a Terrorism supporter who actively kills Palestinians for propaganda purposes by mounting missiles on hospitals and schools. Prevents patients from leaving the said hospitals, actively kills Israeli and started all wars and acts like surprised Pikachu when they lose territory after losing wars. Wants Israel to die and Jews to die and cease to exist on the planet.

Completely destroyed Lebanon single handedly. Tried destroying Jordan and staged a civil war against the King of Jordan but but but you are the victim. Kudos on your victim hood."
Then what even is the conflict all about?
"> Zionist movement was much less violent that the invasions.

Brother, they cooked babies in ovens.

Good God every single day I have to contend with the fact that people like you are educated and capable of voting. A pity for the rest of the country.

Since you've already engaged in frankly hilarious historical revisionism, I'm not going to bother telling you that the Mughals integrated with the local populace far more than zionists ever did. And the Mughals are long dead, we should all be so lucky to see the end of Zionism in our life times.

Please don't embarrass me again. Do something better with your life."

"The incident happened on a day Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned against mob attacks on cattle traders, beef-eaters and dairy farmers, saying killing people in the name of protecting cows is unacceptable.
We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
Police said they ‚Äúrescued‚Äù trader Alimuddin aka Asgar Ali from the attackers and he died in hospital.
‚ÄúThough injured, he was walking then. I think he died of shock,‚Äù Ramgarh sub-divisional police officer Shashi Prakash said.

See police took action"
"ideal route- dismantling the terrorist state Israel, and creating a state of Palestine where all people, regardless of ethnicity or religion are equal

I'd want to go one step further and get all the terrorists who massacred, looted, raped, murdered, stole the homes and lands of palestinians tried for war crimes, and all the lands and homes of palestinians returned back to them

practical route- there is no practical route coz USA would forever support the terrorist state of Israel coz israel protects it's interest in the region"
"white colonisers colonising native people, and taking over their land, white european countries like USA, UK, france, (how was USA, canada, Australia and israel built? **colonising indigenous population and doing a genocide against them**) etc sponsored this whole thing coz they wanted a puppet to control things in Middle East for them

What does middle east have? the power of being in centre, and being able to control world resources..... it has oil, gas reserves, seuz canal, waterways and so many other resources

The whole ""jews return to their homeland"" is a facade covering the atrocities so that when someone speaks up against them, points their atrocities they can cry ""antisemitism"", they weaponised the holocaust and suffering of millions of jews for their own use, it's disgusting

It's all about money, colonisation, imperialism coz white europeans can never care about anything except money

it's the same story of why our nation was colonised for 200 years, pls educate yourself"
"You are the one embarassing yourself. Don't call me brother.

Firstly you seem to have 0 idea about Muslim invasions of India

Secondly you seem to think that Jews were bloodthirsty and Arabs were sitting sheep. The Arabs were always ahead in the cycle of violence and the outcome of violence in the Mandate. It was not until the creation of Israel that Jews were assured the safety. And even after that Arabs were ahead in the cycle of violence. All the wars were started by Arabs."
"Bro everyone knows Jews lived there for millennia, or did they drop from skies like rain? There's nothing to do with Netanyahu here."
You asked me what does Hindu extremism looks like and that‚Äôs all I showed. We are a secular country such crimes should obliviously need to be punished. You don‚Äôt judge a whole religion based on small extremist fraction.
"So I'll ask again, what in real terms do you think will happen to create the state of Palestine?  What does dismantle mean?"
I never judge anyone. I hate when people call another person Hindu extremist for talking logic. It‚Äôs difficult to have a logical discussion. Seems like everyone already has take sides and made up their mind.
"no state of israel, israeli government dissolved, israeli military dissolved, israeli politicians tried for war crimes, all palestinian refugees allowed to return home, all types of restrictions for palestinians from not being allowed to move through their own homeland lifted, palestinians allowed basic human rights (as well as ex israelis) other countries help create a democratic and fair government of both ex israelis and palestinians (should be ensured none of the politicians for both parties should be far right, all politicians should be moderate to left willing to establish a democratic state) political parties formed, basic human rights for everyone, free and fair elections conducted 

basically how rhodesia and apartheid south africa were dismantled"
"No one said someone Hindu extremist for talking logic. The lynchings, beatings, rapes and it's defence are wrong and extremist."
"They do actually. You talk about something logically and discuss objectively for example hamas Israel issue. In their defence they call you fascist Hindu extremist.  Mostly on Reddit I have seen people seem to have already taken sides. No point of discussing objectively. Who defended criminal activities here? Here cunningly you‚Äôre trying to trap people opposing Hamas using buzz words like lynching etc. You‚Äôre doing the exact same thing what I am complaining about. Either a person supports you or they are Hindu extremist, Zionist, fascist. See that‚Äôs exactly the issue here. THIS my is not a discussion, it‚Äôs like fight. Need to be more open minded, being absolutist and debating don‚Äôt go together. It‚Äôs such a waste of time discussing things here. Can‚Äôt learn anything new. Better internet forums available exclusively for debating. Quick question do you think supporting Hamas terrorism is terrorism?"
"Police taking action doesn't justify blatant extremism from people. Kasab was an extremist, killed people. Police took action, caught him and killed 9 others. Does this excuse his extremism? It doesn't.

Here, we have a state government post bail for convicted rapists. These people are then garlanded and celebrated as heroes because the victim was a minority. That is extremism. Police didn't arrest them, and I don't expect them to either because celebrating and rewarding rapes aren't a crime in India.

I think Hamas is a terrorist organisation, yes."
"Yes, it is"
Just read the edited comment. Peace. ‚úåÔ∏è
