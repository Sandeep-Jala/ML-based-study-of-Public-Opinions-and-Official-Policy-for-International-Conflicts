Violence from both groups was commonplace and many lives were lost. Jewish immigrants were able to consolidate their economic and political structures and flourished.\n\nIn 1940s, after WW2, Britain exited the region after multiple failed attempts at the 2-state policy because the promises they’d made to the Palestinians and those made to Jewish immigrants were irreconcilable.

The situation of israel supporting hamas might have been true initially but the support would\'ve dried out after HAMAS\'s first charter came out (where I think mossad fucked up, because HAMAS went out of their control) \n\nThe point of 5-10% jews is partially correct (plus don\'t take these census at face value as they were conducted during colonial rule or Ottomans rule and they didn\'t care about minorities in their country), but if you only include the current israeli-palestinian area, yes a lot of jews migrated from europe but a lot of them also came from the arab world due to discrimination and genocide they faced there. \n\nThe Exiled part for palestinian is always blown out of context," they were not """"exiled"""" like kashmiri pandits (giving this example because you will know more about being an indian", i guess?) They had to escape because a war, in which by some miracle israel won and as they say Victor\'s justice (there is not right or wrong in here) followed soon, land annexation, reparations etc. which resulted in more occupied land than anticipated ( and israel wanted defense in depth so they just kept the land)\n\nUnlike the out of proportion news you hear about mossad, the rescue of israeli civilians is very hard and will most likely result not only in multiple deaths on the part of IDF but also receive no local support for their actions at all which makes it all the more harder (the civilians are in gaza strip, not west bank).\n\nThe use of white phosphorus like substance ( they were never able to verify if it was white phosphorus because nobody got the burns or any source verifying it), so it might have been something else.\n\n But yes israel doesn\'t care about the minorities in its country which is not new for states in the middle east (syria, iran, iraq, jordan egypt etc.) Unlike the more structured societies in the west or the east (though both have their own style of discrimination, which is less severe than the one in the middle east) they don\'t care about minorities, but also actively work against them which include kidnapping, forcefully converting, levying extra taxes etc. \n\nIf you go by the word of the law, israel didn\'t even need to give the warning (non-uniformed irregular combatants, using civilian as meat shields) and humanitarian aid is technically not israel\'s business ( countries that attack normally do that to have a good PR image). Again if they wanted to level gaza they could\'ve just carpet bombed the entire region but they have been targeting specific locations and writing off the civilians as collateral damage (which is a disgusting technique both sides are using).\n\nAnd the last part is wrong, even syria is a more destabilizing agent than israel in the Middle East ( it all depends on who you ask for middle east itself they might say israel but it\'s not like it\'s all flowers and chocolates between the arab states themselves) Plus israel works as a launch pad for evey nation of destroy anything they don\'t want in middle east (nuclear weapons, ISIS, independent oil, etc.). \n\nNobody cares about the atrocities, when kashmiri pandits were killed did anybody make a noise? NO, when jews and other minorites were getting forcefully raped/converted in middle east anybody say anything? NO \nThey did it under the guise of following the rules ( a positive PR image) and HAMAS has led israel to do more damage to gaza than israel ever wanted too.\n\nMy point is we can\'t judge the Middle East by our standards because it\'s a place where they have a decadent amount of money or they are a state where genocides/civil wars/massacres are commonplace which stopped only recently and israel and saudi arabia are at the forefront to stop that (ironically both if them are not stopping it inside of their own country) \n\n>Most of the world is watching an ethnic cleansing with pom-poms in their hands or with quiet complicity.\n\nThey don\'t have any other choice and there are more serious matters at hand for the big players (USA vs China, Russia vs Ukraine, the  India game etc.) And israel is almost everyone\'s big military partner which includes china, russia, india, USA even fucking japan (China has it\'s own genocide going own, America\'s last genocide was like 30 years ago, india is a mess where everyone is burning everything, japan has an unofficial policy of not giving muslims citizenship ) so nobody wants to throw stones when their own houses are made of glass \n\nSorry to break your bubble brother, but palestinian are not important enough for the western or eastern world to fight against israel, and the arab world is in the situation of pot calling kettle black (basically the arab nation commits worse genocides slowly and in a more sophisticated manner, and the only reason they are screaming now is because the victims are Muslims) ( IK the last line seems islamophobic, but sadly it\'s the truth) \n\nI just hope that one way or the other peace returns\n\n\nP.S Don\'t trust any news from Al Jazeera, they present news in such a way that it\'s almost lying (in one section they just said," and I am paraphrasing """"the exile of kashmiri pandits was part of the plan for resistance against India and actions of freedom fighters"""") al Jazeera has a habit of justifying any atrocity commited by islamic extremist organisations.'", 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1697392200.0}, {'comment_body': 'Here we go.

Israel props up Hamas over PLO/PA and then justifies atrocities citing support for Hamas. \n\nI couldn’t find a single source that disputes the 5-10% figures, even the most favorable sources for Israelis count their proportion at 11% in 1900s. Arab Jews migrated to Israel after the events of the 1960s. Most of the immigrants were European colonizers though, long after Israel had already carved itself out of Palestine.\n\nAbout the exile of the Palestinians, I vehemently disagree. They were displaced exactly like Kashmiri Pandits, Gujrati Muslims or any group fleeing persecution during the 1947 partition - they’d to leave or face wholesale slaughter. Israeli forces went village to village and cleared it for themselves. A movie was released in the last few years detailing a Palestinian account which Israel protested aggressively and labelled antisemitic but is a pretty powerful watch.\n\nStrongly disagree with you about victors’ justice, it is definitely wrong by every moral standard. It was wrong when Hitler invaded Poland, prevailed and  began enacting his ‘final solution’ for the Jewish community and it was wrong when Israelis drove the Palestinians from their homes on the strength of the arms with support of the US and the UK owing to ideological and racial similarities. Were there reparations? None that I know of but that is the need of the hour - a two state solution with land and monetary reparations to the people of Palestine and an acknowledgement of all the injustices inflicted on them.\n\nYes, it’ll put the IDF at risk but that is what a responsible state is supposed to do. Israel and their allies have made clear however that Israeli lives are much more valuable than Palestinian lives. Once it starts not treating people like they are animals, perhaps it’ll start getting some local support. It holds all the cards and has to make the first concession.\n\nHRW and Amnesty international have both verified the WAFA news video relating to white phosphorus. Doctors have stated they’ve seen some injuries which may be attributed to the substance. Israel has used the substance earlier in Gaza as well, validated by a different UN agency.\n\nIsrael is actually required to preserve civilian life, it has purposefully not signed the required charters so that it might not be subject to the war crimes investigations. It’s supreme court has stated that Israel law can supersede international law or something to that effect. There are so many videos and stories, all verified by international media, where it is clear that no warning was given to the civilians, IDF bulldozing a school while students barely escape, shooting missiles at kids on a beach and claiming a naval facility when international reporters find nothing, blowing up UN schools which are the only places of safe refuge for Palestinians, settlers shooting a young Palestinian kid playing football and many more. \n\nNot a destabilizing agent, but a threat to peace in the middle east which is Israel. Israel has made itself indispensable through ingenuity and gaining significant political influence in US/UK and can do with Palestinians as it pleases as long as it doesn’t offend too many people.\nIsrael supported Hamas because RW, Likud and worse, doesn’t want a separate Palestinian state. One could argue that without US and Israel, the middle-east would be much more peaceful than it is today.

What Nakba doesn't talk about is that there was a similar displacement of Jews from all the Arab nations surrounding israel.

If they die because they are the shields of PLA, then that makes sense.

If they are unable to control it, they should leave it and treat it the same way as Gaza. Let the PLO handle it. If the pallestine attack israel post that, attack their military without considering whether they use human shields or not. That is my opinion.\n\nEven in Gaza, I don't think israel should adopt these half measures to try and save the civilian. I think they should bomb where the gazan military is.

The idea was revolutionary at the time, an implicit challenge to the Arab regimes in the region that were neither free nor democratic. It was also revolutionary in making an offer to share the land as equal citizens with the people who had driven the Palestinians from their land and placed them under military occupation.\n\n[Source](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/10/29/23926878/river-sea-palestine-free-israel-hamas-war-protest-gaza)\n\nIf you look at the this [article,](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/10/29/23926878/river-sea-palestine-free-israel-hamas-war-protest-gaza) Hamas adopts this slogan in the 1980s, which captures the meaning that you are alluding to and can have an **anti-Semitic interpretation**.\n\nIn summary, there are multiple interpretations of this slogan.', 'comment_score': 0, 'comment_created_utc': 1699894256.0}, {'comment_body': 'Originally it meant that palestine should be the nation and not israel..\n\nArabs were almost 80 percent of the population of Palestine.\n\nIn 19th century world saw the rise of Zionism and Jews from Europe started emigrating to palestine. \n\nJews faced hostilities in Europe and had faced numerous expulsions. Poland was one area where they relatively fared better but once Poland went under Russian rule it witnessed many Jewish pogroms. This further pushed Jewish immigration to Palestine. \n\nIn 1918 Great Britain created the Balfour declaration , that is the commitment to create a Jewish nation in palestine. But naturally this pissed off the Arabs. \n\nIn 1948 the British left and israel immediately faced war. The Palestinians were banished from Israeli land (called the Nakba) . Simultaneously Jews were expelled from other Arab nations such as Egypt , Iraq etc. this started a long cycle of oppression from israel on palestinians and resulting violence from palestinians and so on. \n\nThe slogan originally meant that from the river Jordan till the Mediterranean sea palestine will be the nation and israel , created by Britain will be removed. \n\nIn the 21st century Israel has gone hard right wing (as in genocidal songs , segregationist policies, Jewish settlers/colonialists taking over palestinian homes  etc.) \n\nThis has been condemned by UN , European nations , vehemently opposed by Africans, Irish and Indians (those who have seen colonialism and segregation). This has also helped fuel Hamas because it is able to say that look Israel is evil and hence our violence is justified . \n\nCurrently largely the slogan means that the Palestinians in Gaza and West Bank should get human rights and dignity, something that Israel has increasingly taken away.

The early stage of the Naxalite Movement from roughly 1967 to 1975, is often represented as embodying this powerful duality that encapsulates a response to the brutal violence unleashed by the state against the Movement, but also the tangible hope inhering in the late sixties that a revolution was possible.\n\n*Source* : [Post-Magic: The Female Naxalite at 50 in Arundhati Roy’s The Ministry of Utmost Happiness and Neel Mukherjee’s A State of Freedom](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02759527.2018.1538729)', 'comment_score': 6, 'comment_created_utc': 1699694467.0}, {'comment_body': ""Yeah this is you guys' usual rhetoric"", 'comment_score': 2, 'comment_created_utc': 1699708610.0}, {'comment_body': '>Black looks down as well as white, toh chaat kyun raha hai Trump\n\nKya bol raha hai lodu, point kya hai iska ?

I am a Bangladeshi and let me give you a comprehensive answer to your question.\n\n1. Pro Pakistani Bengalis have always existed, even during the war many Bengalis opposed the creation of Bangladesh and wanted to be united with Pakistan. Reason? Muslim Ummah Ummah. They formed Razakar force, Shanti Bahini, Al Shams to hinder the independence movement. Since India was pro Independence, they hate India because of this.A lot of the India haters are descendants of them. This is only religious and historic reason.\n2. Now lets get to current political, economic, diplomatic and cultural reasons. First of all political: The current Bangladeshi government is very unpopular among a certain demographics,its no secret that BJP is friendly towards Sheikh Hasina and there\'s a conspiracy theory believed and propagated by the opposition that India is keeping Sheikh Hasina is power. This theory was somehow validated by Sheikh Hasina\'s very own foreign minister who said ""I went to India and told them to do whatever necessary to keep our government in power"". The remark put the government in an embarassing situation.\n3. Economic: Bangladesh has given India transit access to North eastern India for a low price and in return we got barely anything from India. This fueled many anti India rhetoric, some claiming ""The government is selling the country to India"".\n4. Diplomatic: During the Rohingya crisis, as an ally, India took no measures against the Burmese government which sent 700,000 of its citizens to our country. On the top of that, India leased one of its submarine to Burma. This was a slap on our face. Then we have the Teesta river issue. During summer, India keeps the gates of Faraqqa dam closed, causing droughts in northern Bangladesh. During monsoon, India opens the gate, causing massive floods.\n5. Cultural issues: It is mainly sports. There was a spike in Anti India hate after 2015 world cup quarter finals where the umpires wrongfully gave clear decisions in favor of India, sparking rumors that India paid the umpires to do so. On a different note, when Bangladesh went to Pakistan, the Pakistanis chanted ""Bangladesh Welcome! Bangladesh Welcome!"" in the stadiums, and in the India vs Bangladesh match this world cup, an Indian fan ripped apart a Bangladeshi fan\'s stuffed tiger toy (tigers are a symbol of our cricket and cricketers).
