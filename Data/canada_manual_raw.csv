"Some guys brought Taliban flags to the Mississauga march:

[Palestinian protesters ask men with Taliban flags to leave.](https://x.com/carymarules/status/1713309715659432265?s=46&t=3dxLepooYuUd4Ny7EdG_wg)",0
Mississauga mayor and city council will soon announce their withdrawal out of Palestine.,-1
How about we just let that country be and watch from the sidelines for once.... We have enough shit to deal with in our own Country,0
This comment section is a spicy hot dumpster fire,0
"The only way this even slows down is if Hamas releases hostages. And that's not going to happen. Most are likely dead or being tortured/raped.

Hamas plans to martyr the entire Gaza population to garner support. Israel can't just do nothing, especially while Hamas is still attacking and firing rockets at them. Their plan is use human shields so Israel is pressured into stopping, which isn't a good ending either.",-1
"Innocent civilians is dying , we and they should urge Hamas to surrender unconditionally right away .",-1
Funny how they never march or protest against Hamas.,-1
Release the hostages first.,-1
"Dumb question - when I see people claim ""pro palestinian rally"" etc... Are they rallying in support of hamas or the senseless violence and poverty of civilians? Because that's a very different Palestinian rally than one supporting hamas. 

Ditto for pro-israeli rallies - is it supporting the state of people? I really wish headlines would specify up front",0
"[Should preface by saying that Rebel News is trash, but just know that yes, some of these pro-Palestinian protesters are also pro-Hamas](https://twitter.com/realmonsanto/status/1713317504812978573)",-1
"So, uh...we're just gonna ignore the fact that there were demonstrators waving Taliban flags at this ""march""?

I mean if we're going to be fair, I do recall liberals labelling everyone who was at the trucker convoy nazis because there were a couple of people with nazi flags.

Should they not apply the same logic and label everyone at this rally a taliban enthusiast?",-1
"I am on their side, but‚Ä¶ unfortunately Hamas isn‚Äôt. There will be peace when the terrorists are eliminated.",1

Isn‚Äôt the violence caused by Hamas? Hamas shouldn‚Äôt receive support from Canadians. Hamas uses people as human shields in Gaza. For example. They launch missiles from the top of residential buildings. They block roads to prevent people from escaping northern Gaza. They want people to stay in northern Gaza when the Israeli military invades.,-1
"It‚Äôs crazy that a march against war crimes is met with such weird responses. Yes Hamas is a barbaric organization. Do you know what drives support for barbaric situations? Bombing women and children. Absolutely nothing happening in Gaza now is showing those people anything but a sign that Israel will wipe them off this planet. 

It is numerous war crimes being committed currently and a protest against that is pretty obvious. I‚Äôm sorry that some people there brought flags or did other signs of support for horrid groups. It doesn‚Äôt take away two obvious things for Canadians. Yes we can protest and yes we should stand to show support against people being blown into oblivion",1
"Strange how things change in a week. Last weekend they were celebrating the 'glorious' actions by Hamas. This weekend they are lamenting the 'violence' against the people of Gaza the moment Israel struck back.

How consistent......",1
"Yes yes, block traffic in Canada, and all will be fixed",0
lol .. maybe they should not have started this round of violence,-1
"This is what Hamas banks on happening. Launch an attack murdering civilians, run and hide behind women and children in Gaza, wait for all the bleeding hearts in the West to start screaming about Palestinian casualties when Israel mounts a response and inevitably hits the human shields that the terrorists are using.

Why is no one blaming HAMAS for what is happening in Gaza right now?",-1
"Well, they might get an end to the violence, its just that the end might come from a thinly veiled genocide‚Ä¶.

God Israel is telegraphing the genocide angle so hard it scares me‚Ä¶",1
"This needs to stop. Stop bringing in blatant terrorism supporters parading in Canadian streets. 

I mean this is as bad as protests supporting the Taliban. 
Muslims are essentially showing the world how primitive their thinking is in discerning such political issues. It's just black and white with no nuance. 

You realize Hamas just massacred 1300 Jews, amongst the largest anti semetic event since ww2. The optics are bad.

Good thing I left this horribly petty faiths Nd don't associate with Canadian Muslims

Did you hear the Muslim Association of Canada was funneling donation money to Hamas. Good game guys",-1
No one condemns Hamas‚Ä¶,0
"Yes, end of violence is good.

Were any of them calling for surrender of Hamas and release of the hostages?",-1
we keep seeing parties based on islam fundamentalism get voted in and then all hell breaks loose and they do some jihad stuff and everyone calls the people who voted for them victims. they are only victims of themselves.,0
"The fact people felt empowered enough to show up here with Taliban flags, had people blocking out cameras running a screen play for them, and were not immediately pulled put of that truck and beaten says all that needs to be said. Hamas is isis.",-1
"Idk.. over the years, I've lost any and all sympathy for Palestinians and the arab/muslim world at large. ""Fool me once...."" and all that, enough is enough. I am not a huge fan of Israel, but in this scenario, more power to them.",-1
Israel is killing civilians by the hundreds now. 2 wrongs don't make a right. But you're not driving sympathy to your cause when you're waving the flags of extremists like the Taliban,1
The terrorists shouldn‚Äôt have started something that they can‚Äôt finish. It‚Äôs hard to imagine the amount of support that they have here in Canada. What would be nice is for all of these supporters be exposed. Maybe just maybe they‚Äôre employers might take action. As a consumer I would like to know if a business I frequent employs terror supporters.,-1
How about the end of violence by the people of Gaza. I think then Israel would have no reason to deal with the situation.,-1
They should all go back and have demonstrations in Israel or Palestine,0
"March against murder of civilians, and all people here can do is pretend every Palestinian is a member of Hammas, ignore the fact that Palestinians are a severely repressed people, and justify Israeli war crimes and collective punishment. It‚Äôs disgusting. I can denounce war crimes without supporting Hammas, and I can denounce Israeli imperialism and ethnic cleansing without being antisemetic. 

Imagine a French based terrorist group attacked Israel. Logistics aside, how would the world respond if Israel could and did: shut of food and water and electricity to all of Paris, drop 6000 bombs on Paris, tell half of Paris to move to the other half of Paris in a day, and murder thousands of Parisian's (far more than the initial attack).

The answer is of course that the world would be up in arms, disgusted, and condemning Israeli actions.

But when the civilians are brown, it seems we have all lost our humanity.",1
"Why don't these marches ask hamas to surrender, considering the fact that they started this crap last weekend.",0
Israel should have given more time for people to evacuate. But the assault needed to happen,-1
"The biggest step toward ending such violence lies in dismantling these strongholds for Islamist terrorists. 

No nation on earth can have any sort of long term peace where such groups like Al Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah, Al Shabaab, ISIS etc. exist.",0
"We use to have a game when I was a kid, the idea of which is to kick each other in the nuts until someone says ""I give up, you win"".   


Hamas is someone who gives the first kick and says ""Ok, you win"" and the rest of the world is getting mad that Israel won't agree to a ceasefire.",-1
Why aren‚Äôt their banks accounts getting frozen?,-1
"So you hate Jews, then?",-1
"**# STOPGAZAGENOCIDE**  
**MAKE IT TREND ON SOCIAL MEDIA!!**  
**Do not let the world watch this carnage in cowardly silence.** Call on your leaders to (1) publicly condemn it, (2) demand an immediate ceasefire and (3) send emergency food and medical aid to the people of Gaza!",1
This comment section and subreddit is full of IDF bots lol,1
Might want to add these to the terrorsit watch list immediately.,-1
"The easiest way is for the people in Gaza to rebel against Hamas and hand over the terrorists to Israeli forces.

Then no siege, and everyone wins (except Hamas).

But everyone already knows where loyalty of most ppl in Gaza lies.",-1
freedom of speech is what is great for everyone,0
I'm sure they'll definitely stop because we said so üôÑ idiots.,0
"What are they expecting to happen? They will look at this march and go ‚Äúyeah they got us, we give up‚Äù like what? Am I being ignorant? I just don‚Äôt see what good it‚Äôs doing anyone and what they are expecting the outcome of it to be.",0
I'm pro hamas ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòÅ,1
It would have been nice to see these same people a week ago marching against violence in Israel.,-1
Holy shit! Canada is DEAD. These people are lying Antisemites and there are thousand of them. This is definitely NOT the Canada I grew up in.,-1
"Gotta ask if anyone else feels the way I do about this.

I just don't fucking care anymore, the whole Israel-Palestine conflict has been going off and on longer than most of us here have been alive and we have big enough problems in **this** country to deal with so why the hell should we waste any more time and effort on people halfway around the world who are never going to change.",0
Terrorism supporters,-1
Good for those people who were trying to get the Taliban supporters to leave.,0
Lmao,0
"So, how many Taliban sympathizers are their in Canada now?  I am amazed there are any to be honest, all these women walking around on their own, must drive them nuts.",0
"So? They told them to leave. That‚Äôs literally all you gotta do when someone shows up to your rally with a terrorist flag if you don‚Äôt want to be associated 

Take notes, convoy people",0
"So that means they're all Taliban, right?",-1
"That's what you get for not bringing enough for the entire class.

C'mon, we learned this at age six.",0
"So, you're implying that they're all terrorists now?",1
But but those Nazis weren‚Äôt with us!,0
They should be identified and deported. Fuck those guys.,-1
"No idea who they were, either. Could have been any random people trying to subvert the march.",0
This is the absolute correct response. If somome shows up with a nazi flag and isn't asked to leave you at a nazi rally,0
It's one truck with 2 dudes. They seemed peaceful and others were telling them to put it away.,0
Peace in the GTA!,0
"Weirdly, former mayor Hazel McCallion was always fairly pro-palestine, despite being conservative on basically every other issue.",0
It's not like Mississauga is itself occupied territory or anything.,0
"Lmao, I don't know why municipal politicians even wade into foreign matters aside from trying to get sympathy points.",0
"Well, because this *is* becoming Canada‚Äôs problem, much the same as how Canada is now getting dragged into India‚Äôs problems. That‚Äôs the ‚Äúmosaic‚Äù identity that Canada has boasted about for forever.

‚ÄúHamas is not a terrorist group‚Äù a woman in Mississauga, a city in a country that has designated Hamas as a terrorist group, repeats three times, while wearing AK-47 earrings. ‚ÄúEverything they do is justified‚Ä¶ Every single thing they have done is justified,‚Äù she says.

[https://x.com/realmonsanto/status/1713317504812978573?s=46&t=3dxLepooYuUd4Ny7EdG_wg](https://x.com/realmonsanto/status/1713317504812978573?s=46&t=3dxLepooYuUd4Ny7EdG_wg)

To people like her everything is justified because Israel is a ‚Äúsettler-colonial state‚Äù that needs to be ‚Äúdecolonized.‚Äù I guess it‚Äôs a good thing she‚Äôs in a country that isn‚Äôt considered by a growing number of people to be one of these so-called ‚Äúsettler-colonial states‚Ä¶‚Äù oh, wait:

‚Äú‚Ä¶these events serve as a reminder that resistance against colonial violence is justified and necessary. This is ""decolonization"" and ""land-back"" actualized as we continue to see the Palestinian people stand firm in their resistance against their oppressors.‚Äù

‚ÄúSettler-colonial states like so-called Canada and their institutions continue to legitimize their existence and those of other settler-colonial states making them complicit in the ongoing genocide.‚Äù

The same argument from people at a Canadian institution in ‚Äúso-called Canada.‚Äù

This event has put a spotlight on something that needs to be taken more seriously in Canada and other countries.",1
That's r/canada for you lol. Lots of nationalism and xenophobia on this sub,1
Always is. That rCanada bay beee,0
"I agree.

Irrespective of all the whataboutism above in this thread, wouldn't the absolute fastest way to deescalate this situation be releasing just 137 people (Hamas claims 13 already died) to ensure the 2,300,000 people of Gaza get vital food, water, medicine and aid ? The fact they haven't released even a small subset of them yet, like the children, speaks volumes.

Israel has called Hamas' bluff on executing the hostages and I'm guessing they have no plan whatsoever at this point except to let their people die.",1
"Ya for all Israel's faults, hamas has put them in a really bad situation here. There just aren't any good options.",0
"Ah yes. The only way for Israel to stop committing war crimes against civilians is if an undemocratic, terrorist group performs a certain action. That kind of black and white thinking is just a thinly veiled excuse for Israeli war crimes",1
Basically. It's always the poor civilians who are just trying to live their lives caught in the crosshairs.,0
"who is we? 

We are so far removed over here from whats actually happening that these rallies and online comments amount to thoughts and prayers",0
"Where have I heard this before?

‚ÄúUkraine should make concessions so there can be peace‚Äù

‚ÄúBritain should negotiate with Hitler so we can have peace‚Äù

‚ÄúLincoln should negotiate with the Confederacy so we can have peace‚Äù

I don‚Äôt want to live in a world where might makes right. Letting any act of aggression like this has only emboldened terrible people. It‚Äôs just led to more war.",1
"and what that result in Israel giving back all the land they have encroached upon forcefully under the guise of settlement

&#x200B;

fuck off with this shit. this is not a one sided affair.",1
But first let‚Äôs urge Israel to stop their land theft and the persecution and murdering of Palestinians! And urge Americans to stop sending money from financing building walls and military. And urge the American government to stop sending military aid! And then! Give all the land back to the families whose homes and farmland were stolen! Unconditionally!,1
You can't surrender to revenge and retribution. This is why everyone calling for more violence has a garbage take.,0
"Well it's not like Israel can sit idly by while Hamas continues attacks, tortures hostages, and launches rockets.

It's sad that they plan to use civilians and childrens as shields to try and get enough scrutiny against israel that outside pressure forces a ceasefire. But thats not a good ending either.",-1
"many palestinians support Hamas. So many in fact that 

>The findings of the first quarter of 2023 indicate that the internal factional balance of power remains unchanged, with parity between Fatah and Hamas, if new parliamentary elections were to take place today, and a majority vote for Hamas‚Äô candidate, Ismail Haniyyeh, over Mahmud Abbas in presidential elections.

Funny Zionists never protest against Israeli atrocities.,1
Because our government can't pressure Hamas. But they can take a stance against Israel and US's unconditional support,1
Bit like how pro Israel folks never protest against idf war crimes or Israeli apartheid.,1
"Funny how ""they"" never protest against apartheid and 50+ years of occupation.",1
Funny how people equate Hamas with civilian Palestinians who had nothing to do with any of this,1
"What would the point be? Even if they somehow managed to replace Hamas, Gaza would still be under a blockade and Palestine would still be subject to occupation.",1
funny how you never march either.,0
"End the cycle of violence (now that all the Jew killing we can get away with for the time being is completed)!

Friendly reminder that the number of Palestinians killed by IDF strikes on Gaza this week if somehow Hamas had been able to avoid slaughtering over *twelve hundred* innocent men, women and children would have been zero.

We are now seeing credible reports that Hamas is preventing Palestinian civilians from going to south Gaza, as always because they wish to maximize civilian casualties for propaganda purposes.",1
"Funny how ""they"" never protest against the mass starvation of Palestinian civilians.",1
"I would love to see you apply the same logic to Israel.  
 
 Even when IDF were sniping unarmed children and were proud about it (even bragging about their precision, and how they knew where every bullet went), motherfuckers like you would immediately scream ""condemn Hamas"" to anyone talking about it.  Lookup the ""March of return"" of 2018 for a great example of unarmed children, pregnant women, journalists and medics getting sniped. Even during those events, the first thing every brown people get asked when they are interviewed about it is ""do you condemn hamas actions?"". No one ever asks the israel side if they condemn the snipping of unarmed children.",1
"Because hamas hasnt dropped 6000 bombs, included illegal phosphorous bombs, on a civilian population with water and electricity cut off.

And to make it totally clear, because people like you like to push a red heron narrative, the protests are in support of PALESTINIANS going through a genocide at the hands of israel, not for hamas.",1
You know the Israeli military has been arresting minors for no reason and Israel has wayyyyyyyy more hostages than Hamas?,1
"I can almost guarantee that the rallies themselves are not pro terrorism and the media is just on its typical outrage cycle. If there were people out there actually chanting in support of terrorism or being anti-semitic you know they'd have the video everywhere.

I say this in part because years ago I popped by a Palestine rally (I live in Ottawa and walk by a lot of protests, I walked through the convoy too to see what was up even though I disagreed) and there were a bunch of Orthodox Jewish people, the speakers called Jewish people their brothers and sisters and said that Israelis are not the enemies, and that was as bombs fell on Gaza so I don't see what would be different now other than the clickbait outrage stuff being even more of an issue in the media.

It goes both ways too, I never met an Israeli in real life who wouldn't be shocked and sickened by some of the things their self appointed ""allies"" say in ""support"". You think the average Israeli is going to feel good seeing random Canadians say that their government should kill 3 million people indiscriminately? These are all people, most of them probably don't like violence or war, as much as the media wants this conflict to define both sides. Acting like Israelis support the actions of the IDF uncritically and acting like all Gazans support Hamas killing civilians are armchair AF and it's interesting that a lot of people do both.",1
Palestinian rallies held here are almost never pro Hamas. I'm not saying they can't happen but I've never personally seen it. They're usually in solidarity for the people of Palestine asking for an end to Israeli hostilities and occupation. Protestors just want the same freedom and rights for Palestinians as Israel has.,1
i mean this headline is pretty clear dude,0
I would never understand why a woman would defend a Muslim terrorist group especially after she has experienced the rights and freedom as a woman in a country like Canada.,-1
"I'm conservative and many years ago I had to stop watching any of their content. (At the beginning there were some good hosts.) If I wanted to have a Canadian parody of biased American conservative commentary, it would be hard not to plagiarize Rebel Media.",0
Did they call them out and ask them to leave?,0
Funny also because the guy with the nazi flag at the convoy protest was an Arab. He was arrested.,-1
Logic is a construct of the patriarchal colonizer world view and must be abolished‚Ä¶.  or something.,0
So uh are we just going to ignore thst the Palestinian protesters forced those Taliban supporters to leave?,0
Again why would you condemn thousands of people for the acts of one or two people. They were asked to leave.,0
No there won‚Äôt! What a thing to say! Do you not understand how colonialism and occupation work? The people of a Palestine are not under occupation because of Hamas. Isreal holds power to end the occupation.,1
"That's why they're doing it, we know how that ends now",0
It would be too late to protest after the US nuked them.,0
No hamas didn't start this conflict. The violence started like 75 years ago mate. Hamas didn't even exist back then...this conflict is not new. It's the result of decades of occupation that has been going on till today.,1
"Because last week they were cheering for the deaths of over a thousand innocent lives. Fuck these people. They want all Jews dead. Them changing the message doesn't change what their message was last week. This is the expected response from Isreal. Everyone in the entire world would expect Isreal to retailiate after a terrorist attack. We don't like it? Tough shit. They either put an end to it now or die later. That's the choice they have. Palestinians elected these fucks. It's the will of the people. This is what the people chose, this is what they get.",-1
"Or poverty. They always bring up poverty.

They clearly forget Osama bin Laden was born with a golden spoon.",0
Why are you not blaming Israel for creating Hamas?,1
Because Gaza is an occupied  territory. The onus should never be on the oppressed to end violence. Isreal holds all the power in this situation.,1
"It honestly feels a bit like after 9/11 where something undeniably horrible and tragic happened then everyone went absolutely bonkers in response, and before we knew it an unrelated country was in ruins and our privacy rights disappeared forever. People are acting like that with all the casual talk of annhialating Gaza and deporting Canadian citizens for wrongthink and thinkpieces about outlawing protests.

I guess it's a break from arguing about pronouns.",1
Pretty much everyone condemns Hamas. Feel free to start a protest!,0
Do you protest for what you believe in or what you don‚Äôt believe in? This is why there is no specific protest against Hamas. Protests are about what you believe in and nobody supports Hamas here,0
"Those radicals rose to power in 2005. Through an ‚Äúelection‚Äù. But you have to understand the situation of people ‚Äúvoting‚Äù and what options they had during the election (if any at all).

2005. That‚Äôs 18 (eighteen) YEARS ago.

Currently 50% (fifty percent meaning HALF) the population of Gaza is under 18 years old.  You think this half of Gazan HUMANS _asked_ to be ruled by this group in this time and age (they all have social media and do see the world outside their prison)? Or have much of a choice?

They grew up in a blockade. And are now being bombarded.  Logically speaking if I was in the shoes of any young Gazan‚Äî and seeing the world SILENT or even SUPPORTIVE of my own genocide‚Ä¶ I _might_ just start believing those radicals ruling over me? ‚ÄúThis is why we need to fight back‚Äî look how they treat you‚Äù No?

"The last election was 20 years ago and half the population is under 20. 

At least try and educate yourself.",0
The people who waved that flag were asked to leave though.,0
Instead they‚Äôre trying to do it by labelling anyone who doesn‚Äôt cheer on their genocide as anti semetic,1
How about the end of violence in the west Bank by Israeli settlers where there are no Hamas. They're shooting Palestinians on the streets.,1
"> violence by the people of Gaza

Half the people of Gaza are children, and the vast majority of them did not commit the atrocities for which they are now being collectively punished.",1
"Of course Israel doesn't want to deal with the situation.

The Palestinians in Gaza Strip are refugees and their descendants that fled, or were forced from their homes by Zionists in 1948. Their property was confiscated and they weren't allowed to return.

They've lived in Gaza Strip refugee camps for generations since. Israel is perfectly happy them staying there till the end of time.

>Most people in the Gaza Strip are descendants of refugees who fled or were expelled from the area that became Israel after the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip

>In 1948, more than 700,000 Palestinian Arabs ‚Äì about half of prewar Palestine's Arab population ‚Äì fled from their homes or were expelled by Zionist militias

>between 400 and 600 Palestinian villages were destroyed, village wells were poisoned in a biological warfare programme and properties were looted to prevent Palestinian refugees from returning, and other sites subject to Hebraization of Palestinian place names

>Later, a series of laws passed by the first Israeli government prevented Arabs who had left from returning to their homes or claiming their property. They and many of their descendants remain refugees. The expulsion of the Palestinians has since been described by some historians as ethnic cleansing, while others dispute this charge. Nevertheless, the existence of the so-called Law of Return allowing for immigration and naturalization of any Jewish person and their family to Israel, while a Palestinian right of return has been denied, has been cited as an evidence for the charges of Apartheid against the State of Israel.

Yup. Israel needs Hamas.,1
"Yeah no, last week they were cheering for the murder, rape, and abduction of hundreds of people. Hamasaki is the will of the people. It's there elected representatives that just decided to go to war by conducting terrorist attacks. Of course Isreals going to retaliate and only an idiot would think they wouldn't fuck a lot of shit up. They warned the people as well, Hamas told the people to stay so they can die and be used as propaganda. No other Middle Eastern country wants these people because they are simply just not nice people on a collective level. It's been generations like this.",-1

But why dont people at these protests ever denounce Hamas?",-1
"Israel isn't removing terrorists, they are indiscriminately killing civilians and applying collective punishment to all of Palestine. Both war crimes.",1
Are you seriously asking why they aren‚Äôt supporting the state that is bombing Palestinian women and children?,1
Isn‚Äôt it because Israel has been terrorizing Palestine for 75 years? That would be like asking the Indigenous peoples of Canada to protest in support of the government that carried out residential school,1
"Good point, why aren't the civilians more open to working with the nation state that has turned off the electricity/water supply while continuously bombing them (and the humanitarian aid groups helping them) and killing international journalists that just want to tell the story of what's going on in Gaza.",0
read a book,0
The Israel and Palestine conflict didn't just start last weekend...,0
Doesn‚Äôt matter how much time they give them. Hamas has been setting up roadblocks to prevent evacuation. As well as forcing people at gunpoint back into buildings that will be bombed. They‚Äôre intentionally maximizing their own civilian casualties.,-1

It is always the vocal minority who drag us into politics we don't want to involve.,0
"Pretty much. This is why we (especially the media) shouldn't give any attention to the protestors. Pro-Palestine, Pro-Israel, far left movements, far right movements etc. A flame dies with no oxygen. Let's just focus on Canadian problems. Interprovincial trade barriers, special interest group overreach/corruption in politics, housing & mortgage rates, opioid/homeless issues, propping up lesser developed First Nations groups, healthier food, stronger economy etc. 

This doesn't mean let's not help outside of Canada either. I'm absolutory for giving foreign aid to countries not at war, and helping out less fortunate areas, but let's just not get involved with external politics. We can still collectively condemn clear ""bad guys"" that threaten global stability like Putin/Kim Jong Un, but Israel & Palestine is way too complicated for Canada to be involved.",0
"I have a theory that if If I put ""Free Palestine"" in a comment, the bots will home in on it.",1
"I suspect most Canadians see Hamas and the state of Israel as guilty of atrocities, are repelled by both, and side with the civilians, Jewish and Muslim, who are suffering. We want an end to the violence, justice for all the victims, and we want our government to help find a way to a reasonable (for all) peace.",0
"I have way more sympathies toward Ukraine than this Israel Palestine conflicts.

For Israel and Palestine, both sides are scummy.

I also want to stay neutral for Israel Palestine, but I want to go all in for Ukraine.

I‚Äôm absolutely tired of seeing the pro hamas rallies disturb our lives here. At the same time keep doing it assholes, the world is getting fed up. 

Argentina made their choice, the Netherlands are making their choice soon enough if PVV gets a coalition. So progressives hijacked liberalism and the far right is slowly advancing. See how that works out? 

Keep waving them terrorists flags and preaching hate speech. Go for it Jihad Z, the tide will eventually sweep you under.",-1
"Canada has no way to tell Israel or Palestine what to do what's so ever we have nothing that we can hold over their heads to stop the conflict, so why should canada get involved what so ever",0
We need to stay out of it.,0
I also dont want millions more refugees,0
Isn't Trudeau planning on bringing in over 10000+ palestinians. Not really staying neutral at that point.,1
Don‚Äôt forget that Hamas kidnapped Canadians aswell we cannot afford to be neutral while they are still being held by terrorists,-1
Neutral would lead to supporting Isreal...for all their faults they at least are operating within some kind of legal framework...,-1
"I feel for the Palestinian people, but Canada is a country that‚Äôs an ocean and a desert away with our own issues. Stay the hell out of foreign affairs and focus on home",1
"Ideally we would have a government somewhat reflective of majority opinion of being neutral.

Of course we don't have that. We have both the major parties consistently voting against 95%+ of world opinion when it comes to Israel.

Basically joining micro island nations in failing to denounce settlers.",0
"Canada sold weapons to Saudi Arabia and yet nobody gave a fuck about the war in Yemen or all the dead people. 

People are getting propagandized to hard to rabble rouse in Canada for a ""Free Palestine"" in order to split the leftist vote and allow pro-Putin fascists to take charge. It's totally inorganic.",-1
Majority of Canadians tired of defending the indefensible and now retreating behind impassivity.,0
"I'll admit a soft pro-Israel bias.

Israel buys our guns and planes; they're a modern economy that is integrated with ours, same as a nation like South Korea or Mexico.

Hamas is more like Al Qaida or ISIS, murderous terrorists who would happily murder us if they got the chance.

I've never been worried that an Israeli terrorist is going to go on a stabbing rampage in my city, or do a suicide bombing, or ram a truck into a crowd. Can't say the same about the people they're fighting.

Support Israel?

Support Palestine? 

I'm from Canada. I support my family when they need me. I support my community. I support the Leafs.",-1
"There is no ""neutral"" position when a terrorist organization commits unspeakable atrocities against innocent civilians.",-1
"We have antisemitism enthusiasts  and useful idiots protesting on the streets with antisemitic slogans  however those as our PM is saying are 'fringe minority'.

Literally all  Canadians I know or neutral or support Israel. People I know are from age group from 30 to 70 year old. I assume those 9% that support Palestine have to be younger.",-1
Then they will have to deal with Hamas and radical islam on Canadian soil.,-1
"I stand with Israel, but I don't have a problem with Canada shutting up. Everything that comes out of Trudeau and Chow's mouth is an embarrassment.",-1
"Ok. Be neutral. Stop sending any money to Israel and disallow Israeli products in Canada. Be TRULY neutral.

Problem is you can't do this. In the internationally connected world we live in you can't just look away and say ""lalalala I don't wanna look"". 

This is exactly the same as not wanting to acknowledge what the Nazi's were doing in the Warsaw ghetto. It's not an out of pocket comparison. It is completely valid.

People don't want neutrality. They want people to stop forcing them to acknowledge the atrocity thar Israel is performing.

Genocidal fascist states cannot be supported.",1
"After reading the comments, it seems people think neutral means ""trade with Israel and vote with them on every UN clause, while ignoring Palestine as a state and voting against them in every UN clause.""",1
I doubt the has ever been a protest march in Gaza or tel Aviv demanding their government do something about Canadian indigenous matters.  They don't care about Canada. Why should Canada care back?,0
Neutrality in the face of genocide?  Grotesque.,1
"All I want is for our government to not directly be supporting genocide or terror. 

Humanitarian aid to massacred children would be OK imo. 

Nothing wrong with building good will in the world for us, especially when so many people hate the USA.",0
"The government is not taking a neutral stance. They actively vote for Israel in the United Nations even when it‚Äôs only 7 countries in the world voting for Israel, Canada and US are the ONLY western countries. Shame on Canada for not being neutral. Can‚Äôt even get that right.",1
Good to hear I'm in the majority.,0
What's that quote about good people doing nothing in the face of evil?,0
The f≈≥ck we do.,0
Gee I wonder why? Maybe it's because if you say anything positive about Palestine lots of people call you a terrorist apologist. Say anything positive about Israel you're a genocide apologist. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,0
I still have no idea why this is even an issue in Canada.,0
What is one of the most geopolitically irrelevant country going to do to one of the oldest ongoing conflicts in human history? Shame them to death?,0

"I think we need to stop sending aid to Palestine, drying up foreign aid would make even Hamas want peace.",-1
"israel = ally

hamas = terrorist

i do not see any logic in not supporting israel with the destruction of hamas.  otherwise it just goes on like it has been for decades.  negotiating with terrorists for hostages is a huge mistake and that would be the only reason why i would say canada should be neutral - it is a total gaffe to do this.",-1
"Honestly I wish our military was 10x it's current power state and we could arrive in force, right in the middle and say ""CUT THE SHIT""

And then, along with an actual functioning UN, take care of the hamas problem as a police operation as it should be.

None of this fantasy is realistic unfortunately",0
"We're literally having like 4 crisis in our home country. I want neutrality because we need to be solving the housing, COL, wage suppression, and government corruption (ontario provincial for sure) crisis here on our home soil before we can even think about helping foreign nations.

To all the people actively protesting for the conflict what do you expect us to do when we just instituted immigrant abuse as our primary immigration policy. What do you expect us to do when anyone we bring in as a refugee definitely cannot afford to eat or live. What do you expect us to do for these foreign nations when our problems are only getting worse because our various levels of government are clearly not making any effort to fix problems that they can profit personally off of.

No matter your view on the conflict we need to fix these issues before we can be of actual value to the people in these regions suffering. Anything else is virtue signaling.",0
So Hamas isn't a terrorist organization?,-1
"Picking sides in the oldest conflict of all time from the safety and comfort of your home in Canada, wave your flags with a belly full of Popeyes that you got doordashed right before you get bored and watch the new marvel/Star Wars on Disney+.

Correct.,0

Outsiders should be involved in conflicts like that,0
"Israel doesn't need our help militarily, and Hamas is a proxy for Iran.  What western nation would ever support them?",-1
"Leave us out of a religious war, Israel vs Palestine. Neither one is good, they both want to kill each other.",0
"Sounds about right. We just want our government to focus on making life more affordable here and keeping the economy from cratering in a deep recession. Most of us don't give a shit about yet another war between Israel & Palestine that's not going to solve anything. 

Let the US deal with this mess.",0
yup,0
I agree,0
"Canada has enough problems within its own borders. We've already taken a stance on the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and extremist settler violence against the Palestinian people. We don't need to get involved in it. Our own citizens are struggling to eat and house themselves, we don't need to send our underfunded and under equipped CAF in to anything, we need to address the problems at home. We can't do anything to stop the killing over there, so focus on where we can actually make a difference.",0
"Israelis and Palestinians have hated each other for a long, long time. Israelis have more tech, more money and more first world support. It's inevitable what is going to happen.",-1
"Ah yes, the old Canadian ‚ÄúNot my circus, not my monkeys‚Äù mindset. It‚Äôs this kind of fence sitting that has gotten us to a crisis in almost every aspect of our lives.",0
This is the way.,0
Our only role is to keep it contained in Isreal. Let Isreal take care of Isreal and Canada can take care of Canada,0
"I mean, it's a long walk to get involved directly. Plus I'm sure there would be a lot of setup/paperwork, probably best I just sit this one out.",0
Why is this even a concern for Canada? We have so many problems at home we should be focusing on. You don't make a sandwich for the hungry neighbors if your own family is hungry.,0
"There‚Äôs so many conflicts around the world. Some we should be involved in some capacity, and others none. 

The only role we should have with the Israel-Palestine conflict is one of diplomacy. Let them decide what kind of future they want, a unified state or separate states. It‚Äôs not our job to decide for them.",0
"We can send our arm forces to invade both Israel and Palestine and add them to the great Canada area..

"We are not outof it though.

I think people want us neutral to avoid all of the protests and hate crimes that are springing up in Canada.  Taking any side at all on this enflames either Arabs or Jews in Canada.,0
"Sure! If they don't want our input though, seems fair to assume they don't want our funding either.",0
They *definitely* want your input. They both want material and political support. They both want the UN to pass resolutions that favour them. For this they need to propagandize.,0
"The Israeli refugee plan has Canada listed as one of the place that they can send hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees to, so sees it as a tool to be used to displace the population they‚Äôre trying to get rid of.",1
"The reason I‚Äôm not ok with this is the fact the only way forward for a two state solution seems to be an international intern government in Gaza.  

When Israel is done with Hamas someone will have to govern Gaza and an international coalition seems like a far more legitimate outcome than a government installed by Israel.  

I think Canada could play a role in supporting that government although I think you‚Äôd also need support from the surrounding Arab countries and Gaza residents to really make it work",1
"Neutral, however, would mean stopping financial support to Israel that is being used to fund the war.  Humanitarian aid for civilians is neutral in terms of taking sides in a conflict.  Arms dealing is not.  And we export millions in weapons every year to Israel.  That would have to stop.  How likely is that, do you think?",1
"Thinking Canada has weight on the international scene is the equivalent of the ""but what does ja rule think??"" meme",0
Palestinians want and need everyone's support and attention... they certainly have my favor. It's hamas that's the problem,1
"There is a position we can, and should take. The position is to condemn any loss of civilian life, and to support a peaceful transition to a 2 state solution as soon as possible.

  
What we should not be doing is providing Israel weapons, nor any support. Naturally we shouldn't support Hamas, but I don't think that was ever happening or going to happen anyway lmao.

However we shouldn't be silent as a possible genocide/ethnic cleansing takes place. We shouldn't have been during the Holocaust, during Rwanda, nor now.",1
">To be fair though I‚Äôm not really sure if either the Israelis or the Palestinians want our input

Canada had sent about $21 million worth of arms to Israel last year and I'm sure Israel wouldn't want that to drop off.",0
The amount of Israeli propaganda and a concerted effort to call everything anti-semitic suggests otherwise.,1

"True, the only thing that could actually stop this war is signed letter from Hollywood celebrities.",0
Being neutral means we stop selling weapons to Israel immediately and do nothing outside of calling for peace and sanity.,0
It has nothing to do with us. Are we going to have an opinion over every single small conflict that erupts in the middle east?,0
hypothetically if hamas was about to overrun israel and create a 2nd holocaust do you think canada should do something then.,-1
The Arab neighbours have unfortunately made it clear that they won't take in the Palestinians. They use them as political pawns.,1
"good luck with that, surrounding Arab nations hate the Palestinians

an Iran wants Israel dead",0
How is Iran a relevant party to this? They aren‚Äôt even Arabs. They just need to stop meddling in Arab affairs.,0
Why does any solution need to involve Egypt and Iran?,0
No it hasn't. We've only said Israel has a right to defend itself and has a right to exist without saying the exact same thing for Palestinians. Why does only one side get to exist? That's implicitly saying it's cool to murder the other side and they should take it.,1
But not the Canadians(?)  protesting on our streets.,0
"Why? Hamas is a terrorist group intent on eradicating the  Jewish people, full stop. 
This is not about a land grab as so many people fail to understand. There hasn't been a Jew in Gaza since 2005. The daily barrage of rockets started in 2006, coincidentally the year Hamas came to power",-1
"It could be better. We need to outlaw selling arms to Israel, and to make donations to Israeli organisations non-tax-deductible. Then we could truly say that Canada is ""neutral"".

Which would be a terrible thing, mind you, but at least lawnmower dads would be happy.",1
How much military funds got sent to Israel again?,1
"There just aren't very many Rohingya, Uyghur, etc. refugees in Canada, not nearly as many as refugees from recent wars in the middle east. Those diasporas just aren't here to push their foreign agendas.

Interventions from the West under pretext of stopping war crimes or atrocities committed on the other side of the world were never *truly* motivated by those things. The protests we see today demanding... whatever it is they're supposed to be demanding are no exception.",0
