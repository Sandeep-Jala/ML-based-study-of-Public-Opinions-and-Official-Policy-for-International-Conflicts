 on the last point I understand israel need to get rid of hamas but their strategy be bear of rage not logic the only people leave behind be go to be the old the crippled and maybe a few suicide bomber the very definition of expendable nobody senior from hamas be go to stay",1.0,0
"you do understand you can make the exact same argument from the palestinian point of view right 

 you know the current living condition in gaza the need to take action against an agressor who keep people lock up in an open air prison the past war in gaza etc   I m sure they be happy to also put the blame for israelian casualty with the israelian aggression   preemptive attack a perfect way to construct a spiral of violence 

 if you know there be go to be innocent casualty and you go ahead with it anyway its an equally conscious   decision to kill they   the hard fact do not lie palestinian living condition number of casualty and territory lose clearly point at israel be the aggressor",-1.0,0

"zionism as I understand it be the idea that the jewish people deserve a homeland in the area now call israel and I m all for it   
 just like I would be for it if the japanese people want a homeland in the area now call japan   
 but to be honest it do nt even matter because there be a state call israel and there be people who call it their home btw not only jews but also muslim druze bahai christians and other group any historic narrative be meaningless since there be an ongoing narrative of people who be bear there

 people who be not israeli citizen eg palestinians citizen of palestine can not enter the country or move freely within it without proper document and authorization from the official port of entry this be what people wrongfully point to when they talk about israel be an apartheid state but this be also true for every other country on earth try walk into japan without authorization

"I do nt think palestinians be oppress because jews hate they   I do nt think the religion be really a factor and if role be reverse palestinians get support from the west have superior economy and military jews would be back into an open air prison and bomb right now 

 if I have my foot on your neck and I release you may very well become the killer   and if I push my foot down I become the killer   its a war   and the strong kill and oppress more people take more land   that s israel 

 its not a matter of which culture have justice or ethic on their side   be all the same brutal specie in the end   but because israel be strong it be win   its killing more take more land oppress more people   it have the power to enforce a for example 5050 divide of the land stop settler of take more and more   but that wo nt happen because they be win  

 yes I do think israel be generally the aggressor   not because they be bad people but because of the circumstance   that do nt make they less aggressor tho 

 do I have a real solution   no   normally this end by the stongest push everybody into submission mass migration   or genocide   its why people speak spanish in south america",-1.0,0
"settlement be wrong but israel have repeatedly give up land for peace in 1977 with egypt israel request that egypt take the gaza strip egypt refuse israel withdraw from most of the west bank in 1995 and from all of gaza in 2005 even netanyahu sign the wye river memorandum in 1998 give palestinians land to selfgovern israel offer to withdraw from all palestinian territory in at least two other occasion 2000 and 2008 the palestinians refuse  


 what I see the world start to realize be that hamas be just like isis and alqaeda and that palestinians be a terroristsupporting culture like iran and afghanistan the protest around europe call to kill jews and not condemn the horrible thing hamas have do be begin to wake europe up to the inevitable clash of civilization with the muslim world   


 thank god japan do not allow massive muslim immigration into the country   
 the world be now realize what a horrible ideology fundamental islam be  


 do you know that israel offer the palestinians to swap land so that settler will remain in their house and in exchange israeli arab who call themselves 1948 palestinians and their land will be part of palestine   
 do you know what happened the israeli arabs refuse they prefer to live under zionist law rather than subjugate themselves to another fail muslim dictatorship and I bet you would choose the same

 when you want to know what someone really believe do nt listen to what they say look at what they actually do   
 israel have repeatedly give up land for peace in 1977 with egypt israel request that egypt take the gaza strip egypt refuse israel withdraw from most of the west bank in 1995 and from all of gaza in 2005 even netanyahu sign the wye river memorandum in 1998 give palestinians land to selfgovern israel offer to withdraw from all palestinian territory in at least two other occasion 2000 and 2008 the palestinians refuse 

 there be no reason to believe that the settlement wo nt be evict as they be in gaza gush katif sinai and the west bank if a real offer for peace be propose the problem be that the palestinian people do not have any leadership that speak for they and that be interested in peace  


 mind you that the people who call themselves palestinians only start to identify as a separate and unified people around 1967 before that they be different tribe indistinguishable from jordanian or egyptians the palestinian people be now in its angry teenage year and still do nt have a cohesive cultural identity sociologically speak   


 so all israel can do at the moment be stabilize the situation until the palestinian people mature enough as a people to have a leadership they can get behind that actually want to build a sustainable future alongside israel",0.0,0
"ill agree with you on this the current government of israel be full of radical right wing extremist that have rob the israeli people of the chance to discuss a long term solution to the conflict but  


   the israeli public have be protest for month against netanyahus current government and for the past decade against his former government netanyahu do not even represent half of the israeli public but he manage to abuse the parliamentary system that israel inherit from the british and be unfit for israeli society something like donald trump lose the popular vote by 3 million vote yet still be elect into office netanyahu have fail to secure a government in 4 out of the last 5 election and have only succeed by unite with these extremist who be a very small minority in israel and only because the leftleane coalition against netanyahu have fragment into multiple small piece that do not even get a single parliamentary seat   
 also if you research bengvir the most extremist of netanyahus government his ticket to office have nothing to do with the palestinians and everything to do with the rise crime in southern israel  
 what I mean by that be that netanyahu be a flash of the pan and lead a minority government and his day in office be probably over in recent pole the likud party be down to 19 seat from its former 32 seat the rest of his right wing coalition have also go down between 3050   accord to the most recent pole   
 the protest against netanyahu have a lot to do with the stagnation of the peace process if you look at any image from the protest you will see peace activist and palestinian flag but they be mostly about corruption and judiciary reform   


  all this and more and it do nt even begin to compare to palestinians elect and support hamas not even close what happen on october 7th woman and child slaughter in their home family burn alive woman rape elderly people kidnap people shoot in point blank execute in front of their family dog shoot body mutilate this be the kind of evil that only islam can create on a large scale if israel want to kill palestinians it would have do so easily probably within a year instead the palestinian population have triple in size in the last 50 year hamas openly support the atrocity and the palestinians who support hama know this very well no one be try to hide this do nt even try to both side this
