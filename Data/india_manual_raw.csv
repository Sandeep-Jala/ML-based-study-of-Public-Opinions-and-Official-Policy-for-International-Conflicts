Those who support Palestine didn't even condemn Hamas. Tell me what was the point of gathering together for Palestine support on the same day the Israelis were massacred. It was rather a support for Hamas than Palestine. You can't justify the massacre of 1200 innocents by giving us the context of history.,-1,
"Indians support because they supported us in need i.e Kargil war. The whole world support is sham. In recent years a lot of islamists joined the ranks of think tanks and media orgs, now they project whatever the fuck they want.",-1,
"Israel out of all odds survived and saved their space they deserved while surrounded with deadly religious neighbors. 

I like their guts. 

Their attitude of no backing down no matter how hard they were thrown into a corner.

India is in same place with neighbors ready to attack and occupy India or destroy India.",-1,
Israel coz wonder woman.,-1,
"I used to support Palestine, but not any more. That doesn't mean that I support Israel either. While I vehemently hate Iran for starting this thing, but I think the reason behind Iran starting this is the internal unrest it faces today. To distract people, it financed a war. The US and the West on the other hand used the war as a military expo, demonstarting arms for potential sellers. It is a demostration of live arms.",0,
"""The whole world"" has not chosen Palestine, The US, UK, Germany, France and so many more nations are vehemently pro-israel. Why are dumbassess like you allowed to speak on issues omg.",-1,
"Isreal sucks for what they've been doing to palestine. Hamas suck for what they recently did. 

To oversimplify it, it's an ESH situation where neither side is good. 

I'm on the side of the innocents suffering through this whole mess.",-1,
"Israel coz my people have suffered what  the Israelis suffered at the hands of Hamas.

Also how can someone with moral conscious support what Hamas did but Most Gaza people are doing so it's an easy choice.",-1,
"I would be on Israel side. Cause just now, Biden administration and Israel PMO both confirmed beheading of babies and toddlers by HAMAS TERRORISTS in Kafr Aza.

And yeah, France chose Palestine by illuminating Eiffel Tower in Israel Flag, USA chose Palestine by illuminating White House in Israel Flag and sending US Gerald, UK and Most of EU chose Palestine by Stopping their aid, UAE chose Palestine by condemning their actions. And many more countries are on Palestine Side.",-1,
"More support for Israel. It's similar to the entire region there. Israel IS in their ancestral lands. The Jewish predate Islam by thousands of years. The ancestral people have been neighbors in some fashion likely for all of history. 

Many people mistakenly believe Israel took something from Palestine.   They didn't.  But that's the basis for most of it. They think Israel is unusually brutal to Palestine. They aren't. Ppl should go look for themselves or open a few books.",-1,

"The native people? Jerusalem is historically Jewish. They were expelled from their land. Canaan. Israelites. Palestinians are philistines who migrated to the area. Roman's came. The turks came. They were pushed out. Then provided the land back to them. Because of the nature of diaspora you have this mix of who the Jewish are ethnically. So what?

It's not a Palestine vs israel thing. It's a terrorist in a blasphemous name of Islam vs Israel thing.

Israel did not colonize. They returned. And they aren't leaving again.",-1,
"Hamas is the result of DECADES of the same violence that Israel subjected the people of Palestine to, that they are experiencing rn. They didn't just wake up one day and decide to bomb and murder. Israel is a colonial state that has killed children and women in numbers that Hamas could never even reach. It is despicable that innocent civilians and children have suffered because of this, but a lot of them are the same people who have taken over the homes and lives of Palestinian people, murdered them, burned them alive, without consequences.

I think Palestinian people deserve their independence and the right to dignity and life that they have been deprived of for years. However, since peace talks between an oppressor and the oppressed cannot exist, it doesn't matter what side you take. There is no peaceful resolution. There is only surrender, and Palestine will once again have to do it, eventually. The world has too many disgusting greedy powerful forces to let humanity come before politics, religion and violence.

Any conversation on the same is also pointless. Israel will kill, Hamas will kill back. The news will sensationalise the war and earn TRP. Overall, no change will be made and people will die.

I know I will get downvoted but I don't really care. Ignorant people will continue spewing all sorts of hatred to justify their beliefs.",1,
"Whole world isn't choosing Palestinine.
Only islam and left are supporting Palestinine. Countries with any sense of morality is supporting Israel.
Palestine should be freed from illegal occupation by Hamas",-1,

"Palestine because Israel is a settler colonial State built on the blood of the native people. 

The Israelis are not native to the land, they are all European migrants.",1,0
Palestine for me. Cause it's good to pronounce. I think that's why the whole world.,1,
hamas killed civilians. israeli air force killed civilians in retaliation. ask the dead body on either side who's right and that is your answer,0,
Duh. Check the countries who recognize Palestinian statehood before asking such questions.,-1,
The world is not choosing Palestine FYI. The pro Palestine protests are getting banned everywhere. UK just banned Palestine flag for time being. Berlin banned the pro Palestine protests. Keep your agenda to yourself. The pro Palestine protests are getting cancelled everywhere.,-1,

"Clearly they are not referring to the government, a very small number of people. Polls show MAJORITY of people stand with Palestine. Worldwide.",1,
"This is the correct answer. There is no 'good' side here. Israel has mistreated palestine like nobody's business, and hamas' response is less than noble. Heck, with the whirlwind of misinformation floating around social media, we can't even claim to know what is actually happening. 

This is like a family drama. There is no point in outsiders like us getting involved or offering opinions. As much as we may hate it, this is an internal affair, and us getting heated over it will only be seen as a weapon by the ones involved, not support. All we can do is hope the innocents get through this and asap.",0,
"If you are an Indian, what if Arabic people come over to India and rule because Mughal ruled us and what if they claim this is our land because of that history?

by the way I am a Christian

And if you are not an Indian, the current America is not filled with true Americans and the native Americans or red Indian has been wiped out from their own land.",-1,
No they aren't? Majority of Jews in Israel are not originally from palestine/cisjordan but from europe. The Palestinians arabs are the indigenous people of that area. Just because jewism is older Islam doesn't mean that the Palestinian ancestors came later. Their ancestors just had some other religion like Christianity.,0,
"Lol what books are you reading? Zionist propaganda books? If you really want to understand the issue, read Ilan Pappe. 

Palestinians are the native people, whether it be Jews or Muslims, the Israelis are settler colonialists from Europe. If any place, the settlement of the Jewish people should have happened in Europe because that is where historically they were expelled from. 

You people with your tiny brains are too fixated on religion whereas the issue is much more complicated and nuanced. It’s a clear cut battle between the right to existence of the native people and a settler Colonialist State expanding it's Imperial power to make room for more accumulation of Capital.",-1,
"Jerusalem wasn't just Jewish. It also had Christians and Muslims who existed with the Jews. That's why there are Palestinian Jews and Palestinian Christians. They co-existed peacefully.

It was religion and Zionism that told people Jerusalem is Jewish land. All of it is a big sham in the name of religion.",-1,

Particularly if it's been decades of it. It would be political suicide to support them.  Not saying they are perfect. But given the above, I'm inclined to believe the atrocities carried out, is pure evil. Those that did it = evil. Anyone condoning murdering  babies, is complicit in the act.",0,
"Nah, you are spitting fire. This is exactly what this is.",0,
The only right answer in this entire dumb sub,0,
It's also rich Indians want to comment on isreal palestine but hate it when outsiders comment on Kashmir - which is our version of the gaza conflict. Both sides have been atrocious to the other but keep on pointing fingers as to who's worse. Ask a pandit who lost family and their home during the exodus vs kashmiris who live in the valley today who've lost family to the military and the atrocities done by them. People who live in glass houses should really not throw stones at others.,0,
"Who came first jews or muslims? If today Kashmiri hindus go and claim there properties and lands in Kashmir will you call it settler colonialism. 

Judaism is an ethnic religion like parsi you can't convert and become jew.

Were mughals older than Hindus?

I will support any Cause of native Americans claiming their land",0,
"No, not true. You trying to paint israel as ""white"" is ignorant and wrong, and it isn't even hard to research without visiting to see for yourself.

Because of the spread of the faith and the diaspora with the establishment of a Jewish state, you'll likely see more 'European' looking people than neighboring states but you really are inserting baseless opinions and assumptions.",1,
This is all factually incorrect. Try again.,0,
"What is Israel supposed to do ? The two nation theory has been declined many times by Palestinians and if Hamas is not finished they will just attack again. It is Hamas to blame. What did they think while attacking civilians, raping and beheading them. Any nation has the right to retaliate. It's the cowardness of the Hamas to hide behind women and kids.",-1,
Well he didn't condemn Hamas and didn't you read my comment that you can't justify the massacre of 1200 innocent in the context of history.,-1,
"Christianity predates Islam by hundreds of years, and Judaism predates both by....a lot. 

Jerusalem is originally Jewish. Israel as israelites in the land of Canaan. Where the philistines (Palestinian) migrated to.

Don't need religion to know this, we have ancient secular Roman and Greek texts (among others) that tell us this.",-1,
"That biblical story is a return or something, idk.

Historically they resided in and around the land of canaan. And Jerusalem is Jewish.",-1,
That's incredibly ignorant and incorrect to say.,0,
"Without proof? WITHOUT PROOF? There has been well documented articles, news reports and also nationally televised interviews where Israelis have boasted about killing people. Read the UN report for Gaza and Palestine. It shows kids and women killed by Israel greatly exceed that by Hamas. Just because you're an ignorant fucking fool doesn't mean there's no proof. Keep your eyes shut, clown. And get a life, you have been responding to this thread for over 24 hours now almost",-1,
"Majority of them are literally not from palestine, they had no ancestors there ever. That is just a fact. They are just colonisers, nothing else.",-1,
"Counter it then, how is it incorrect? 

Ah I get it this subreddit is filled with RW zealots who don't know anything, downvote me as much as you want, your hatred for Palestine only stems from your bigotry against Muslims.",-1,
"The Israeli ministers haven’t condemned the atrocities they’ve been carrying out against Palestine either but nobody questions that, was my point.",1,
"I agree, the earliest people there were Jewish. Who you call Israelites, doesn't come from history but religious texts. There's a difference between Jewish people and Zionists. Not all Jews are Zionists and the idea that Jerusalem BELONGS to Jewish people has been ascertained by religious texts and Zionists.",0,
"Palestinian people were living peacefully until Zionists came and took over the land. Please note, that even at that time, a lot of Jews lived in Palestine. They still exist as Palestinian Jews. Zionists and Jewish people are not the same.",1,
"You too, and you've yet to produce anything other than propaganda.

And if and when you do...my first question is going to be...why?  

Most likely because they are retaliating against something. 

They've both bombed each other....back and forth, over contested areas.

Show me where they did what hamas did?

No, I'm educated and I've spent time in the middle east with a number of ethnic groups and know the realities first hand...besides having been a regular reader of middle eastern history and modern day geopolitics. 

And who is complicit in the support of baby murders? Not bombings that hit everyone. Individuals who snuck in and raided homes and personally raped and murdered families and children with knives. Laughing about it.",0,
Let's For sake of argument I agree with you but does that absolve Hamas of what it did?,-1,
It's not a fact.,0,
When there are 2 millions radicalised people that want to eradicate your nation you just can't let them do that. Hamas was elected by the people of Gaza in 2006. So you have to bear the consequences. You just can't bite the hand that feeds you. And what about the celebration of the massacre Palestinians were doing. Spitting on a naked body of a woman parading her and celebrating like a festival. No nation will tolerate it.,-1,
"They would have given refuge in surrounding countries if they didn't create coups wherever they went. In short Palestinians become destroyers of the countries, wherever they are death and destruction follows.",-1,
"They bomb each other over the contested areas. If one bombs another, the other responds in kind.

Palestine could just stop. It's really Hamas. 

And where is the footage and facts saying Israel did the same as hamas?",-1,
Hamas started sucide bombing so Israel had to put restrictions. Hamas hides between civilians so it's hamas' fault that innocents get killed.,-1,
"I use the term to israelites to distinguish them from the general term of canaanites, which both terms are historically accurate. A lot of ""religious texts"" actually double as ancient historical texts and, when speaking of the people and its history, are largely corroborated by other ancient texts from places such as Egypt, Greece, Roman Empire, etc.",0,
"Glad to find some sane people here, Lol this guy is a RW idiot with pure hated against Muslims, no point in arguing against such people, it’s not like your effort to teach them a lesson in history will change his heart.",-1,
"The number of different Jewish people are many.

Zionist or not, Jewish have been persecuted, conquered, and displaced often.   

Izionist or not, they all identify as Jewish. And most differentiate themselves from other indigenous people.

The violence is perpetuated by religious extremist hamas. 

What is internationally recognized is the civil war that lead to an independent Jewish state. 

The point is the disgusting acts hamas carried out and that people are actually saying Israel (as in the Jewish) should leave even though that IS their ancient homeland. 

It is the Palestinian as well but they as philistines migrated from the coast in ancient times. They both have claims but the Jewish have the stronger claim, the older claim and the current claim...as well as being internationally recognized as legitimate.",-1,
"I'm not? I haven't spoken one piece of propaganda. What I'm talking about is well documented truth done by the United Nations. 

https://www.unrwa.org/2014-gaza-conflict

Here is the link. You can read how many civilians died in Gaza as a result of Israeli bombing. 

""2,251 Palestinians were killed; 1,462 of them are believed to be civilians, including 551 children and 299 women. 66 Israeli soldiers and five civilians, including one child, were also killed. Overall, 11,231 Palestinians were injured during the conflict, including 3,540 women and 3,436 children. Roughly one third of these children will have to cope with disabilities lasting throughout life as a result of their injuries.""

Now if you can't read and will call this also propaganda, that's on you.",0,
"Nope, not at all and I condemn Hamas completely.",-1,
"Do you absolve Israel of their ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians that has been going on for decades now? 

All I am saying is that this is not an isolated event and has to be seen in the right context, what Hamas(A Jihadi Islamist Organisation that I hate) has done now, Israel does on a regular basis without any repurcussion or accountability.",1,
"There are nationally televised interviews of Israeli soldiers boasting about raping 16yo Palestinians, why didn’t you speak up about that? You’re literally basing ur opinion of a war that has been going on for decades over 2 reels without even digging into the crimes the other side has suffered. FYI that woman was eventually found in a hospital and I’ve seen circulating articles how that whole thing was edited.",1,
">When there are 2 millions radicalised people that want to eradicate your nation you just can't let them do that.

But Palestinians should let the millions of radical Israelis eradicate them?

If you are so disgusted by war crimes then you shouldn't support Israel either.",1,
"So why doesn’t Israel seek refuge ? Considering they have all the super powers backing up, they should seek refuge in any of these countries that will accept them with open arms lol. But dropping bombs over decades and being surprised on facing retaliation is the way Israel to go about it ?! 
If the Palestinians are expected to bear logic and move out, makes more sense for Israel to be doing that tbh. The hypocrisy lol",1,
I can’t believe you’re asking for footage of Israel doing the same…just do one google search..the ignorance is soo real I cannot believe this,1,
So whose fault was it for the millions of Palestinians that have gotten killed over decades and nobody took a stand ? Why the hypocrisy is what I’m asking ?,1,
Nope. The term Israel itself comes from the Bible. Jacob and his twelve sons fled to Egypt from where they were led by Moses to Canaan. That forms the core of what we know today as Israel. It's in the Torah too and even actual scholars agree it is not an accurate description of the origins of Israel.,0,
"Zero hatred. But you are spreading lies. Such ignorance is pathetic.

I'm not against Islam or Palestine. I'm not claiming Israel is perfect either.

My statements are true.

Hamas is evil for brutally murdering babies.

Where is your heart?",1,
"You are a fucking idiot if after all that explaining shit doesn't go into your head. People of different faiths were co-existing peacefully until Zionists came and started their colonial rule. It wasn't Muslims who started killing Jews and taking their land. Claim on the land is based on fucking religious scripture. Before the Zionists, no Jewish people were killing Muslims and taking their land.

Zionists did to Palestinians what Germans did to the Jews. Even right now, there are a lot of Jews who are and have been calling for an end to the inhumane treatment and oppression against Palestinians.

Hamas is a result of Israel's continued oppression of Palestinian people OVER DECADES. They created this evil, and yes it is evil. But Israel is to blame for it. Your comprehensive skills are blinded by your hatred but that's more than half of Indian reddit who barely use logical analysis and empathy while absorbing history. Keep up your rant, engaging with this stream of echo chamber voices is unbearable.",1,
"So, I read actual UN reports from the UN.

As I keep stating, israel is not perfect. They essentially do the same to each other, and Israel shouldn't be attacking contested areas or purposely targeting civilians.

At no point did I say I'm against Palestine or Islam, nor did I say I'm for Israel unequivocally.

What I stated is still fact.

Hamas is an extremist terrorist organization supported by Iran for a geopolitical agenda. They murdered babies and families brutally. It goes far beyond bombing each other. They also call for jihad across the globe etc. It's wanton violence. 

That is what I'm against. I'll support holding Israel accountable for its violations, but Israel is a recognized state and they still belong in their territory. 

Hamas absolutely needs to be eliminated. Israel should leave the contested areas as they legally belong to Palestine. 

And people should not be complicit in supporting any baby murderer. No need for the whatabout-ism. Any baby murderer is inexcusable.",1,
"What about the massacre of 260 people in the peace music festival, and what about the kid executed in front of her parents and siblings and what about the people that were killed on their beds.Don't just justify the barbarism.  Palestine elected this government. they have to bear the consequences.",-1,
"I guess the oppressed people decided to take revenge on kids, women and elders so that way they can free their land. They thought beheading them , slitting their throats burning them alive would make Palestine free from israel.",-1,
Did Israeli people attack Palestinians?,0,
They indeed seek refuge in Europe until Hitler showed up and survivors went back to their place besides all that Jewish population in surrounding countries dropped from millions to couple thousands. Iran was one of the largest Jewish population state after Islam the population dropped to 8k in 2021.,0,
Well you can't just let the people whatever they want when their sole purpose is to eradicate your nation.,0,
"Sure, scholars agree that various secular texts that corroborate the additional ancient ""religious texts"" are wrong.

Where you are headed is purely a linguistic argument that really has no bearing on what I'm talking about.

Use the term Canaan and canaanites then.

Earliest term of Israel is egyptian as well, which predates the Bible by 1,500-2,000 years.

The history of judiasm likely goes back further IN that region of canaanites, Judah, the Levant in general. 

But it's what we also label them today, in academia. 

I'm really not sure what you're trying to say or why...but it continues to sound inaccurate.",0,
"Are you dumb or just lack basic comprehension skills, I have condemned Hamas, they are Jihadis.",-1,
"There are periods of co existence, yes, those exist too.

And the entire world somehow tolerates this?",0,
"But that's the thing, Israel has never been held accountable in these decades of oppression. People are quick to jump the gun to blame Hamas. They're apologists, just like you are. Apologists for genocide and a settlement colonial state.

You say Israel isn't perfect, having killed more babies and women than Hamas could never even come close to. Condemnation of the oppressed using violence to fight back, while calling the oppressor 'less than perfect' is absolute hypocrisy.

Also, about the children beheadings, the White House just denied that Biden saw pictures of those. The only ones following this narrative are Israel, the people who have been continually portraying themselves as victims while continuing to kill thousands of Palestinians. They manufacture content without proof to give them excuses to perpetuate acts of war.

Lastly, bombings isn't the only way Palestinians are killed. They are burned alive by Israeli settlers (including children), denied access to water and food and electricity. People in Gaza live in the largest open air prison in the world. I have more links and clips for you to learn from, but given your absolute defence for Israel, calling them not perfect for committing war crimes, I don't think you'll need it.",1,
"Gaza is called the biggest open air jail in the World, it's heavily surrounded by IDF soldiers at all times, who basically do whatever they feel like doing with the people, their movement is restricted by Israel and so is their subsistence, they have to rely on Israel for everything, from electricity to food. 

Kya tum Pakistani soldiers se surrounded rehte ho at all times, who can fu*k you up anytime they want? Kya tumhe apne hi country me idhar udhar jane ke liye Pakistani checkposts se guzarna parta hai? 

Hamas ko maine kab defend kiya bhai, I just said it's an inevitavle reaction to decades of systematic oppresiion, it's easier for you and me living comfy lives to moralise oppressed people.

It's quite clear ki tereko ghanta kuchh aata jaata nhi hai, you just saw a couple of videos 2 din pehle aur aa gua yahan Israel Palentine karne, beta jake ek aadha Kitab padho is subject matter pe. You are too ""Phillistine"" to know anything nor you have the IQ.",1,
Nobody should be killed. Especially women and children. But the same sympathy should’ve been extended to the Palestinians all these years. The fact that it becomes an issue only when it’s Israel under attack screams hypocrisy. Period.,1,
Yes they have been conlonizing the west bank which the world agree is palestine territory for years and idf has been killing Palestinian children every week at this point.,1,
"They didn't seek any refuge in Europe, they WERE Europeans, you don't seek refuge for hundreds of years.

There was substantial Jewish population in the Middle East, in fact Jews enjoyed better social status under the Muslim rulers, they prospered and became merchants, academicians, doctors etc during the Islamic Golden Age. In fact, some of the biggest traders in the Arab World back then were Jews, compare this to the treatment of Jews in Europe, where they were ghettoised, expulsed multiple times, couldn't acquire any noble position in the kigdom.

The Jewish exodus from the Muslim World is a rather recent event.",-1,
"Once again, Israel has literally been eradicating Palestinians over decades ..where was your concern then lol",1,
"All I'm saying is, the ones who came claiming the land to be theirs and called it Israel were Zionists. They started the colonial rule. Natives to a region doesn't mean they have the solitary right to it. Palestine had Jews, Christians and Muslims co-existing until Zionists came and called the land their rightful heritage, because their book claims it to be.",1,
"I think you mistake my position. 

I support humanity. I support facts.  The UN reports did not mention any atrocities as committed by hamas.

Again, hamas is an Iran backed terrorist organization that has called for the deaths of innocent citizens from other countries.  Not okay.

Palestine and Israel, the people of the region has waged this war in some shape or fashion throughout all of recorded history, with relatively brief pauses of respite or peace.

Hamas is the evildoers today. Hold them all accountable for what the facts support.

That's my position.

Innocents should never be targets by either side. Babies should not be murdered.

As i stated before, hold any intentional baby murderer accountable. 

Specific language because I'm specifically not an apologist of any sort.",-1,
"Well Palestinians rejected two states solution 9 times, then they became radicalised. They started proxy war. What Israel is supposed to do. And the killings of Palestinians occurred mostly because of the Hamas. Hamas hides behind the innocents and uses them as sheids than attack you so what do you expect from israel they just can't let Hamas attack them.",-1,
"They have been getting billions of dollars in funding. What did they do- buy rockets, weapons, train terrorists etc.",1,
"You are talking an exchange of bombings.  Whereas Israel has regularly targeted the aggressors who hide amongst innocents while hamas or Palestine targets civilians purposely. 

West Bank is a contested area. We can condemn Israel for it if they are on the offensive with violence. Sure.

But let's not condone raping and murdering families and babies with knives by sneaking into neighborhoods by anyone. 

And Hamas is who did it. Yet people are supporting them, evil. Because of half truths and propaganda.",0,
Go over and tell the Israeli that. Vast majority of them look like any other average citizen in the middle east.,-1,
"All kinds of shit happened in past. The Islamists started killing men and converting women after they lost Arab war with Israel the same process is happening in Pakistan and Bangladesh with hindus.
Indians support Israel bcoz we know what kind of a disease Islamic terrorism is.",-1,
Does it justify the massacre of 1200 people. Don't spam the same story. Tell me how the killing of 1200 civilians helps the palastine movement. It's just made it impossible. Why were they celebrating.,-1,
"They did that 3,000 years ago also. Except they were canaanite Jewish, Judah Jewish, Levant in general Jewish. (Not the actual names but the regions)

Edit: and I think it has more to do with the regular persecution and displacement of the Jewish in the region. ""Zionists"" were more like the match that was lit. The fuel to burn was already there.",0,
"Okay then don't say Israel is less than perfect. Say Israel is the evil and Hamas is the result of that evil. I agree no civilians should be hurt in such matters but it is also the same civilians who kill and burn Palestinians. The bottom line is, Israel is not even facing half the violence they have been subjecting Palestinians to, over decades. We should condemn Hamas, but the foremost thing to do is to stop Israel and it's injustices because it has gone too far and for too long. Hamas isn't some terrorist organisation that decided to kill Israelis on a whim or because of a religious dictat. They do so because they are tired of seeing their people killed and tortured and denied basic human rights over generations. Condemn Israel first. Stop their injustices, hold them accountable for what they have done. And then talk about Hamas.

And yes, eventually, Hamas should be held accountable too. But you can't expect a liberation movement for freedom to not be violent. Yes, who is subjected to that violence is wrong, but first say that to all the mothers who lost their children in Gaza before evening beginning to talk about the Israelis. The Palestinians have had their babies and families murdered and tortured by Israelis over generations.",1,
"Bro it’s so fucking simple

Idf bad for human right violations and Hamas bad for human right violations

Jesus Christ",0,
"Brother, firstly thank you for being respectful and civil about the discussion. Secondly, you really really need to keep your bias aside and educate yourself on the matter a little more. Take a look at the number of deaths and rapes Palestinians have faced on the regular basis before the hamas attack. They’ve now just retaliated. Please give me a single reliable source stating that Palestine has received billions in funding. In fact the entire issue is that major world powers like UK and USA are backing up Israel openly. Israel has been ethnically cleansing Palestinians for decades with 0 consequences. 

People need to understand that the big rich boys of Middle East won’t take a stand cuz they don’t have to be worried about being voted out, they’re a monarchy. The world leaders don’t go and fight the war themselves, they don’t care about the people dying. They’re doing wtv helps them earn brownie points that help them win their next elections.",1,
"There was a massive influx of Jews from the Middle East into Israel starting from 1947 but still the overwhelming majority traces their ancestry back into Europe, the majority is Askenazi Jew.",0,
The number of non Muslims that go and thrive in Middle East living their tax free life would suggest otherwise lol. History wasn’t easy on anyone. Wars and surrendering was the norm. The west propagated Islamophobia to cover up their own shit and the world ate it up.,1,
"In every other argument, your blatant hatred of Muslims and victim mentality crops up, it’s so draining to argue with people like you. 

The material conditions in South Asia and the Middle East are DIFFERENT, please read before you come here yapping. You seem to beleive that Muslims are a cult of people whose existence rests upon the sole ambition of destroying other religions, which is such a pathetically ludicrous idea, how come Jews thrived in the Islamic World and not in the Christian World then? Islamic Terrorism is a recent phenomena, read up on how Imperial powers gave birth to it. Ideas don't run the World, Material circumstances do.

Please read up on the subject instead of wasting everyone's time with mindless drivel Muh Muslims Bad, Saar we Victims too saar, Israel our brothers saar.",1,
"I hear you.

 I'd still need to see more evidence to support how long it's went because I believe they both have been doing it to each other this entire time.

It also doesn't take into account the Israeli persecution that made them feel that perhaps some Palestinian feel today.

Not sure drawing a line in the sand and saying everything after this point is what counts.

I'd also condemn both sides at the same time.

I could perhaps understand, but using evil as an excuse to do evil is not an excuse. I won't budge there. I won't condone any evil for any reason.",0,
And what do you expect from a nation when you kill their innocent citizens brutally. What was Hamas trying to achieve here . Didn't hamas think of the consequences of this. Why would any country support Palestine when there are dozens of videos circulating where people are being killed mercilessly and Hamas has captured 150 hostages why would anyone support Palestine. Hamas should have gone for the IDF not for the citizens. Palestine lost all its sympathy of years. Sadly innocents will suffer because of the foolish decision of Hamas.,-1,

Hamas has kept Gaza hostage but this is because Gaza has allowed Hamas and celebrated Hamas.

A viable Solution for the Palestinians to the Israel Palestine problem can only be through talks on the table.

Violence can only achieve destruction for either the Palestinians or whole of the Middle east.

Well it's on you to decide.,0,
It's not like I'm ignoring it I'm just saying in the name of Palestine people are supporting Hamas. People celebrated the massacre of Israel in the name of free Palestine. That's not the way. No one condemned Hamas and Hamas did more damage to Palestinians than Israel ever did. Now Israel has a licence to kill as much as they want yet people are not ready to say that Hamas is responsible. If they want peace they should release the captives first then Hamas shall surrender ( won't happen) . Why would Israel stop bombing if it has a clear enemy that's going to attack again. Israel's goal is to eradicate Hamas. Now it's on Hamas to surrender or see their people die. I don't want Palestinians to die but you can't leave Hamas alive to attack again.,-1,
"Wow, You're not only a degenerate islamist, you are also a classist and racist too",-1,
I really don't give a fuck what happened in opposite side of the world. Palestinians have all the advantages but they blew it with coups.,0,
"Copying from below : you’re dying on the hill of “NoBODY cOnDeMnED hAMaS” …without once acknowledging that nobody condemned Israel ALL THESE YEARS…Hamas is the result of DECADES of the same violence that Israel subjected the people of Palestine to, that they are experiencing rn. They didn't just wake up one day and decide to bomb and murder. Israel is a colonial state that has killed children and women in numbers that Hamas could never even reach. It is despicable that innocent civilians and children have suffered because of this, but a lot of them are the same people who have taken over the homes and lives of Palestinian people, murdered them, burned them alive, without consequences.

I think Palestinian people deserve their independence and the right to dignity and life that they have been deprived of for years. However, since peace talks between an oppressor and the oppressed cannot exist, it doesn't matter what side you take. There is no peaceful resolution. There is only surrender, and Palestine will once again have to do it, eventually. The world has too many disgusting greedy powerful forces to let humanity come before politics, religion and violence.

Any conversation on the same is also pointless. Israel will kill, Hamas will kill back. The news will sensationalise the war and earn TRP. Overall, no change will be made and people will die.

I know I will get downvoted but I don't really care. Ignorant people will continue spewing all sorts of hatred to justify their beliefs.",1,
"Nope, I’m a realist. There’s literally a 30-40% salary increment if you’re a European in kuwait (which is where I grew up fyi). There are Asians working in every social strata.

I’m literally speaking facts, I’m sorry if it doesn’t sound like music to your delusional ears lol.",0,
You call me biased but you are yourself biased. I can bet you are muslim. you don't see the situation of Israeli people and their sufferings. You just believe the massacre is justified because Israel did the same so Hamas is right. Palestinians want the complete area that's not possible you can't migrate 8 million people. Two states solution is the only way but Palestine doesn't agree with it. So I guess sadly the powerful will rule . Violence would take Palestine nowhere. Violence shall never be justified. I see the pro Palestine supporting the massacre so why cry when someone is doing the same with you. I am completely against the violence but one side sees it subjective so the other would do the same.,-1,
"That’s the easiest game to play here : I can bet 200% on the fact that you’re not a Muslim lmao. In fact I’m sure you find a way to justify ur Islamophobia while not agreeing to the fact you’re an islamophobe lol. You’re once again coming here and crying here about the sufferings of the Jews, ( which I do acknowledge btw- wars suck in general…nobody deserves to die like this ) but you’re literally not for once acknowledging the Palestinian genocide that has been going on for decades. The people celebrating the Hamas massacre aren’t the ones who will go to war for Palestine if it comes down to that. They’re not the victims or the representatives here. Look into the plight of people who are actually suffering and decide better for yourself. 

You’re literally blissfully ignoring the fact that Hamas has attacked right now while this had been happening in Palestine for years. The chronology of these events is important in deciding who is the oppressor and who is the oppressed. The rejection of 2 state theory seemed unfair because of the borders and the area of land under distribution. Palestinians rejected the proposal, they didn’t start attacking civilians while being backed up by the strongest nations in the world…that’s something that Israel did. You keep forgetting that Palestinians were being attacked all these years, they retaliated now.",1,
"Simple in points
1) I acknowledge the bad things Israel did
2) I'm not islamophobic ( you called me biased so I said it too)

Questions for you just answer clearly -

1)  what was Hamas trying to achieve by killing civilians
2) how should Israel deal with terrorists that killed and abducted your citizens
3) Why should Israel not bomb the terrorists areas when they are firing missiles
4) isn't it right to wipe out Hamas that is a terrorist group and a threat for your nation.


Edit -typo",-1,
"1. You haven’t really acknowledged all the bad things Israel did until now ( thank u for that tho). So how do u justify all that? And what do u think is the solution, Palestine should stay chill n get bombed ? 

2. Oh sweetie we both know better about that rn..but sooner or later it will be the new normal ..dw about it xD 

Questions - 
For the 1000th time 

1. Hamas retaliated for what is being done to Palestine for years by doing The same literal thing. ( whilst knowing they will have to bear the consequences which they are). 

2. Israel has been dealing with the people by literally killing Palestinians over years. The war has been on for years. They were holding a music festival at a site where 1000s of people are held captives. Palestenians are held captives and they retaliated. If you get the logic for Israel, why not for Palestine ? 

3. For the 100000 time, Israel had been bombing Palestine for decades. They retaliated now and it’s an international issue where the minister of Israel openly claiming to have cut the water and electricity supplies and is somehow still the oppressed one ??Are you following this ? 

4. They’re not just wiping out Hamas. They are and have been bombing civilians ( including children and women) for decades and still continue to do so. Resistance means Palestine isn’t trying to win the war in numbers here. They’re trying to take a stand. Keeping mum and being in the good books of the rules brought no good because enough people didn’t condemn Israel. They’re fighting back now. The sad part is it shouldn’t have come down to this.

You thought you really did something with these questions lol. While you’re not even acknowledging the fact that Palestinians retaliated after facing decades of same Violence in the hands of Israel.",1,
Well it's not the answer to my question is it?,0,
"Lol you are justifying the killing of 1200 civilians by historical context it's really sad and ironic. Well if Hamas knew the consequences so let them bear the consequences. They brought it to themselves. If they would have attacked IDF it could be considered as retaliation. The thing that Hamas did was a total massacre of innocents. You have double standards when it comes to life . Palestinians lives are important whereas it is fine to kill , rape and behead Israeli civilians.",-1,
Now see the list too…you wouldn’t have asked those questions lol.,0,
"Nope. You’re justifying the killings of 1000s of Palestinians all these decades cuz it fits the pre formed notion you have of a certain sect.

"Neither because it's related to an Abrahamic prophecy and I am not Abrahmic.

This is what Jews believe:

""These prophecies require three great events before the Messiah can return: the nation of Israel must be restored; Jerusalem must be a Jewish city; and the Temple, the center of worship and sacrifice in the ancient Jewish world, which was last destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D., must be rebuilt.""

Evangelical Christians also believe that Jews need to be in Israel for their prophecy to be fulfilled which is why so many evangelical Christians send funding to Israel:

""Christian believers are instructed by Scripture to acknowledge the Hebraic roots of their faith and to actively assist and participate in the plan of God for the Ingathering of the Jewish People and the Restoration of the nation of Israel in our day.""

This is what Muslims believe about end times/judgement day:

""It is narrated in the hadith that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The Hour will not begin until you fight the Jews, until a Jew will hide behind a rock or a tree, and the rock or tree will say: ‘O Muslim, O slave of Allah, here is a Jew behind me; come and kill him – except the gharqad (a kind of thorny tree).""

"I believe that a country's first priority is to secure their own citizens' lives. Israel letting Hamas off the hook this time would be a grave injustice to the Israelis who have to live in continued fear of such attacks. Hamas are cowards, secretly supported by surrounding Arabic nations. Egypt has actually murder Palestinians and destroyed their houses when they tried to cross over so don't buy any of their bs about the poor Palestinians.

Hamas has ensured that when Israel retaliates, innocent lives in Gaza will be lost. They hide in hospitals, schools etc. They set up launching pads for their missiles in civilian areas. They block Palestinians from evacuation during war. Hamas as an organisation has been nothing but brutal to the Palestinians too.

Diplomacy is based on mutual respect. If you sit quietly because you value innocent lives, when they clearly don't, you are asking for the cycle to repeat over and over.

Hamas and Palestine have refused to even agree to the 2 nation pact since the 1990s. Israel is willing but they aren't. They openly say that we don't want a single Jew in this area.

Please note that 20% of Israelis are actually muslim, they live in peace. They vote. Palestinians and Hamas have been known to kill/harass Jews on their side of the border. If not today, it would happen tomorrow. Hopefully Israel manages to take action that brings about stability from now on at least.",-1,
"Let me start by saying that I believe Palestinians deserve a viable state. However, I am absolutely horrified by what Hamas did. Hamas needs to be punished. But the way Israel is exacting revenge by razing down Gaza is deplorable and condemnable. The Arab states should also be condemned for not using their influence. Iran and Qatar have blood on their hands.

Then Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan also have no right to exist as they too have taken Hindu Land. Iran has no right to exist as it took Parsi Land and on and on and on it goes.

The terrorists and the nations were posting about their support for ""Palestine"" while the brutal attack by Hamas was ongoing where babies were beheaded and women raped. That alone exposes their mindset and its support for terrorism that favours them. These same countries go mute when someone in their ummah blows himself up in a street full of innocents in the name of Jihad.",-1,
"Not really on the side of either but the attacks on civilians need to stop . They were initially done by Hamas but now Israel has taken it too far. They’re basically slaughtering women and children at this point in Gaza and they have been a brutal apartheid state for a while. 

I feel like the real blame is in Colonial Britain for deciding to create Israel out of someone else’s land. For some reason they have escaped all blame and accountability. And then second comes the American military industrial complex who will push for more extreme wars because they make so much money off them. People are just fodder for them.",-1,

That being said, you can support Palestinian aspirations without defending the actions of Hamas, and you can also sympathize with Israeli civilians without defending IDF or going all out against pro-palestinians.

I believe rather than giving it a religious tadka, one should see it as a cycle of violence and terrorism. And it just doesn't sit right with me to compare which side is more in the wrong. They both are. One life gone and thousands of life gone, terrorism is terrorism. I sympathise with innocent civilians on both the sides. It's a shame that money talks in real world and of course everyone's gonna be looking at what benefits them. I know it's harsh but it is what it is. This is not a black and white matter.

Israel created the monster known as Hamas because of years of exploitation. Now Hamas is striking back and Israel is playing the victim card. Neither side should be murdering civilians to demonstrate their point but I think Israel government should be tried and executed in public court and Hamas government (after being punished for war crimes) should have a guarantee given to them about their citizen's lives and freedom from exploitation. Of course all this is only possible if the most powerful countries in the world interfere but seems like everyone already bought into Israel's victim card playing.

They are not the colonisers. Jews are the original people of that land.

Palestinians had a problem with the Jews.  So UN gave seperate country for Jews and muslims aka Israel and palestine.  Immediately after this, all the Muslim countries surrounding israel attacked israel and israel won. They got additional land in this process.

Not sure what you mean by this. They can leave to Egypt or other countries whenever they want. Israelites afaik, just don't want them in Israel. If Egypt is not letting them in, that's not Israel's fault. 

>They have been taken up land from the Palestinians and displacing them.

Yes because palestine attacked israel and israel won that war along with alot of territory that the UN gave pallestines. If pallestines had won that war, the same would have happened to Israel.

>It was the Israel government which removed the Jews from that region so that they can blockade that area. 

It's Hamas who unofficially governs the Gaza strip, who doesn't want any jews into their territory. Israelis have check points and such. They allow restricted movement, such security is must for their self defense.

>Palestinians are not allowed to leave.

Not really sure from where you got this. Even after the attack the Palestinians wanted to go to Egypt and Egypt is the one who declined.

>You are misrepresenting the reality.Now explain the ""mentality"" that you speak of.

“Palestine is an open air prison” - simply not true,,
">The six day war was started by Israel. 

Nope it isn't that straight forward, Syria attacked israel first, then Egypt was joining in but before they could it went to standstill with American intervention. So Egypt instead of attacking went ahead and created blockades so that Israel couldn't trade. These tensions is what caused israel to not just wait for others to attack and decided to be on the offensive and initiate the 6 day war.

>Nothing gives them the right to drag people out of their own damn houses just because 10000 years ago their ancestors lived there.

They don't have the right to drag people out just because their ancestors lived there. But when in war, civilians will be hurt.  I assume you are talking about something that might have happened with civilians during this war when the Gaza strip was invaded.

Again I am saying, you cant just blame a country just for winning. Israel is basically surrounded by Muslim countries who simply don't want israel to exist. I am not going to condemn israel for wanting and fighting to exist. If they get additional territory during the process, it's the spoils of war.",,
">Israelis literally shoot down peaceful protesters on the streets in the name of protection.

Yh I don't trust how peaceful the peaceful community is going to be. Most probably the Hamas terrorists would be using civilians as shields and the return fire would have injured them. We used to see this tactic used in Kashmir. So that they can play the victim. 

>It was a group among Hamas who is doing the firing of rockets. Putting the blame on the entire country is stupid.

This is not a popular opinion. But yes that is my opinion. The whole issue was started by the country. Hamas is just a child of that mentality.

>Why tf would civilians trust the Israeli government who has done nothing but oppress them the entire time?

They shouldn't, just don't ask the isaelis to trust that they are innocent civilians either.  Because many of the ""innocent civilians"" actions are not so innocent towards the israelis.

"The conflict predates the attack on Israel.

According to an Ottoman survey, Jews constituted 5% of the population of Palestine in the mid 1800s.

Fundamentalist Jews envisioned a Jewish nation in Israel in the late 1800s. The idea was deemed moronic by most but gained traction due to the growing anti-semitism in Europe. 

Jews from Europe began migrating to the area in thousands and established an international fund to buy land from natives. At this point, Palestine followed a zamindar-like system which was disrupted by the Jewish immigrants -owing to their policy of employing only Jews which led to an increase in Arab unemployment. This is the start of the conflict as we know it.

Britain, which was administering the region, time and again put it’s own political interests above the welfare of the Palestinian people. In 1920s, the Passfield paper found that immigration had upset the economic stability of the region and should be curbed but they walked it back owing to political pressure from Jewish groups in Europe and America.

Immigration intensified in 1930s owing to persecution and illegal immigration (at 10x) the permitted began to take place. Violence from both groups was commonplace and many lives were lost. Jewish immigrants were able to consolidate their economic and political structures and flourished.

In 1940s, after WW2, Britain exited the region after multiple failed attempts at the 2-state policy because the promises they’d made to the Palestinians and those made to Jewish immigrants were irreconcilable. The US president, inspite of the findings of his government, pushed for unlimited immigration of Jews into Palestine. After this, Jews constituted roughly 1/3rd of the population. They were granted half the area in a proposed partition including the most fertile lands - Palestinians rejected the proposal and attacked along with other Arab neighbors. They lost and were driven from their homes. The rest is history.

The whole saga reeks of racism and imperialism, India suffered both at the hands of the British and that shaped our policy of support to Palestine. Even Gandhi said that immigration was incorrect and that Jews must return to their homes even if difficult.",,

But after the Israeli takeover they forcefully irrigated the land (through resources from more modern europe) and which led to this belief that the jewish were given more fertile land.

We have suffered the same, but now the point is that the israeli state cannot be removed from the map, jews will be there. 

But my point said above still holds true, which is  the Arab nations and independent Palestinian states have given very little confidence to Israelis that they will not butcher them (as history has shown they have done repeatedly)

Israel also terrorizes Palestinians frequently through settlements, random violence and deprivation of their rights, which begets your point about a scared populace - so long as Israel continues to subjugate Palestinians they’ll resort to violence unless a Gandhi-like figure emerges among them.

But lets take the example of a gaza strip, when a israel handed over gaza strip to Palestinian government, it was immediately take over by HAMAS (which we all can agree is a terrorist group), which had no inclination to work with israel for a peaceful solution (yes, I see the hypocrisy that after israeli occupation are Palestinians supposed to forget everything, but that's what it takes and that's how leaders are supposed to behave) so after HAMAS started controlling gaza they just attacked jews (be cognizant of what I am saying JEWS not israel), HAMAS came into power with the Idea of erasing jews from all of middle east and they started bombing israel, which in turn made israel lose all intrest towards welfare of west bank and further resolution of the conflict which has now rilled to what we see today.

As for the jew occupation part, both jews and Muslims used to live there even during Ottoman empire, but the British promised same peace of land to both ( there were no occupiers initially), which then escalated into militia fight jews and muslims in the area, and later the ENTIRE Arab world attacked The newly formed state of israel and as everbody know victors justice followed soon  (and as I said a scared nation will do anything to protect its people). because Arab nations only have to win once, while israel has to win everytime time (the stakes for israel are far bigger)

Now, let's see what I understand in the conflict and why HAMAS needs to be destroyed
1. Israel doesn't want to bomb residential buildings, but if they house weapons the choice becomes simple for them. 
2. What HAMAS did in this attack was way beyond what's acceptable ( something called moral ambiguity israeli might have done the same, but if they did it they tried to hide it. HAMAS didn't) and if you can't even pretend to follow the rules they there is essentially no difference between you and an animal 


Please understand thet what's happening to Palestinians is horrid and needs to stop, but HAMAS connot be allowed to exist anymore HAMAS has now become a tumor/Cancer of the modern world (Just like ISIS) 

AND i know that only even 1/3 of gaza strip actually supports HAMAS, but there is no other choice. 

I just hope peace returns to the area",,

"I hope you realise egypt controlled gaza before LOSING it in war against israel.
And if you don’t know that israel america and egypt are arranging a corridor, you need to read up more om how geopolitics work.

wouldn't the same be said about Israel though? its an extremist government which has killed 600 children in the last 4 days. they're a democratically elected government funded by American tax payers and committing war crimes and ethnic cleansing with this money. how are you holding a militant group which is a product of occupation more accountable than a democratically elected government?,,

"I do agree with you that Hamas needs to go, it’s the second biggest threat to the people of Palestine after Israel itself. But, as you mentioned, Israel has been subjugating Gaza and the west bank for decades now (some sources even suggest that it supported Hamas when PLO began too much to deal with - a theory which bears some weight because the US did the same thing in Afghanistan with Al-Qaeda) : after years of suppression with no end in sight, all you have to do is claim that you’ll act tough against your enemy and you’ll get all the votes. 

As I mentioned in my first comment, 5% Jews lived in the area in 1800s. The British decision to make a land for Jews was politically motivated. European Jews invaded a land over time, called it their own and exiled more than half a million Palestinians with US support. The land was most definitely occupied, a lot of Israelites have come forward and expressed horror at what they witnessed their country do at it’s inception.

Israel never had any interest in the welfare of the Palestinians, otherwise they wouldn’t be committing their continued crime against humanity. Israel also possesses the capability to hunt Hamas and save the captives using its intelligence agencies, being a recognized state it ought to not act responsibly but has instead chosen the route of disproportionate response in contravention of many international laws.

Israel definitely wants to punish civilians, it has been using White Phosphorus and bombing the area relentlessly. It has collectively punished the entirety of the Gazan refugees for the actions of a militant group. 

There is no such thing as pretending to follow rules, you either do or you don’t. Israeli politicians have openly been talking about flattening Gaza, they’ve asked 1.1M people in an area devastated by their bombing campaign and repression to move to another area with no provisions for housing, food or anything else…

It baffles me that people recognize Hamas as a threat to middle-east peace but not Israel which has committed at least 100x atrocities. Most of the world is watching an ethnic cleansing with pom-poms in their hands or with quiet complicity.",,

They funded terrorist organizations for their own benefits, but they also destroyed terrorist organizations when terrorists targeted them. I dont think any of these events has religion involved.

So after knowing all of these you expect people to be kind towards terrorist organizations? Lol.",,
"First I'll like to say thank you for having this kind of civilized discussion, I can't tell you how I learn from it and how much I appreciate it! 

1st is about the votes part, HAMAS actually did not get even 50% of the vote, but because of how the election system in palastine is set up they got the win in elections. The situation of israel supporting hamas might have been true initially but the support would've dried out after HAMAS's first charter came out (where I think mossad fucked up, because HAMAS went out of their control) 

The point of 5-10% jews is partially correct (plus don't take these census at face value as they were conducted during colonial rule or Ottomans rule and they didn't care about minorities in their country), but if you only include the current israeli-palestinian area, yes a lot of jews migrated from europe but a lot of them also came from the arab world due to discrimination and genocide they faced there. 

The Exiled part for palestinian is always blown out of context, they were not ""exiled"" like kashmiri pandits (giving this example because you will know more about being an indian, i guess?) They had to escape because a war, in which by some miracle israel won and as they say Victor's justice (there is not right or wrong in here) followed soon, land annexation, reparations etc. which resulted in more occupied land than anticipated ( and israel wanted defense in depth so they just kept the land)

Unlike the out of proportion news you hear about mossad, the rescue of israeli civilians is very hard and will most likely result not only in multiple deaths on the part of IDF but also receive no local support for their actions at all which makes it all the more harder (the civilians are in gaza strip, not west bank).

The use of white phosphorus like substance ( they were never able to verify if it was white phosphorus because nobody got the burns or any source verifying it), so it might have been something else.

 But yes israel doesn't care about the minorities in its country which is not new for states in the middle east (syria, iran, iraq, jordan egypt etc.) Unlike the more structured societies in the west or the east (though both have their own style of discrimination, which is less severe than the one in the middle east) they don't care about minorities, but also actively work against them which include kidnapping, forcefully converting, levying extra taxes etc. 

If you go by the word of the law, israel didn't even need to give the warning (non-uniformed irregular combatants, using civilian as meat shields) and humanitarian aid is technically not israel's business ( countries that attack normally do that to have a good PR image). Again if they wanted to level gaza they could've just carpet bombed the entire region but they have been targeting specific locations and writing off the civilians as collateral damage (which is a disgusting technique both sides are using).

And the last part is wrong, even syria is a more destabilizing agent than israel in the Middle East ( it all depends on who you ask for middle east itself they might say israel but it's not like it's all flowers and chocolates between the arab states themselves) Plus israel works as a launch pad for evey nation of destroy anything they don't want in middle east (nuclear weapons, ISIS, independent oil, etc.). 

Nobody cares about the atrocities, when kashmiri pandits were killed did anybody make a noise? NO, when jews and other minorites were getting forcefully raped/converted in middle east anybody say anything? NO 
They did it under the guise of following the rules ( a positive PR image) and HAMAS has led israel to do more damage to gaza than israel ever wanted too.

My point is we can't judge the Middle East by our standards because it's a place where they have a decadent amount of money or they are a state where genocides/civil wars/massacres are commonplace which stopped only recently and israel and saudi arabia are at the forefront to stop that (ironically both if them are not stopping it inside of their own country) 

>Most of the world is watching an ethnic cleansing with pom-poms in their hands or with quiet complicity.

They don't have any other choice and there are more serious matters at hand for the big players (USA vs China, Russia vs Ukraine, the  India game etc.) And israel is almost everyone's big military partner which includes china, russia, india, USA even fucking japan (China has it's own genocide going own, America's last genocide was like 30 years ago, india is a mess where everyone is burning everything, japan has an unofficial policy of not giving muslims citizenship ) so nobody wants to throw stones when their own houses are made of glass 

Sorry to break your bubble brother, but palestinian are not important enough for the western or eastern world to fight against israel, and the arab world is in the situation of pot calling kettle black (basically the arab nation commits worse genocides slowly and in a more sophisticated manner, and the only reason they are screaming now is because the victims are Muslims) ( IK the last line seems islamophobic, but sadly it's the truth) 

I just hope that one way or the other peace returns


P.S Don't trust any news from Al Jazeera, they present news in such a way that it's almost lying (in one section they just said, and I am paraphrasing ""the exile of kashmiri pandits was part of the plan for resistance against India and actions of freedom fighters"") al Jazeera has a habit of justifying any atrocity commited by islamic extremist organisations.",,

Beacuse they are doing something which is required to be done by Muslims as per kuran.

Sahih al Bukhari 2926
Book 56,Hadith 139.

This is not a geo political issue.The root of this conflict lies in kuran and the hate in kuran against jews . But the Islamists hide this religious angle and make it a geo political problem.",,
"Just a completely unbiased take here.

Yes what Israel is doing is dirty and fuck them. 

But the PLO and the civilians themselves have shot themselves in the foot multiple times in the past. When the Israeli-Palestine two states were formed. The stupid muslims couldn't take up the shit that the entire land wasn't theirs and their religion literally promotes unprovoked violence towards the Jews. Hence they sided with other Arab nations and scared Israel ever since making them change their policies. It was the Palestinians who started this shit. Then they rejected the Two-State Solution THRICE. And when they did accept it in Oslo Accords, the extremist civilians couldn't digest the shit that they'll have to co-exist with a Jewish State and hence they formed and elected Hamas. The PLO themselves are no angels either, before Hamas existed they used to commit suicide bombings and terrorist attacks in Israel, they're considered moderate now cus they've been weakened by Netanyahu and Hamas is just much worse than them. And the civilians of Palestine in the present era are still STUPID cus they still promote extremism and Hamas and if you think I made this source up? Just check out why no elections have been held since 2006 the PLO was shit scared that they'll be overthrown, Jordan and Egypt warned them not to hold elections either and ISRAEL threatened the PLO from holding elections cus they don't want Hamas to control the west bank as well.

Once again I'm completely neutral here, just stated the past. 

The Palestinians including their pro-Muslim civilians who couldn't take up two states existing started this war and now the Israelis are ending it. That's what happens when you ""Fuck around and find out.""",,

you don't support either faction. not taking sides is taking the side of the oppressor. Israel was formed by ethnically cleansing the local Palestinian population. Palestinians are told that their lives don't matter as they're massacred for years. Netanyahu wasn't the only Israeli leader who committed war crimes. Palestinians haven't elected Hamas since 2006 - that's 17 years. 40-50% of Palestine population wasn't even born that time. it doesn't matter why the elections aren't taking place. the truth is that there has been no election and the Palestinian people are at the mercy of a government and people who btw chant death to Arabs at their rallies. and who vote for the leaders who will keep the status quo of keeping the Arab population subjugated.,,

"Um, Hamas won with 44% of the vote and at that time, from what I know, they contested claiming they’d be peaceful but had a sordid past. Currently, atrocities are being justified against Palestinians because elected Hamas. This is such a lose-lose for Palestinians, though is it not? Israel props up Hamas over PLO/PA and then justifies atrocities citing support for Hamas. 

I couldn’t find a single source that disputes the 5-10% figures, even the most favorable sources for Israelis count their proportion at 11% in 1900s. Arab Jews migrated to Israel after the events of the 1960s. Most of the immigrants were European colonizers though, long after Israel had already carved itself out of Palestine.

About the exile of the Palestinians, I vehemently disagree. They were displaced exactly like Kashmiri Pandits, Gujrati Muslims or any group fleeing persecution during the 1947 partition - they’d to leave or face wholesale slaughter. Israeli forces went village to village and cleared it for themselves. A movie was released in the last few years detailing a Palestinian account which Israel protested aggressively and labelled antisemitic but is a pretty powerful watch.

Strongly disagree with you about victors’ justice, it is definitely wrong by every moral standard. It was wrong when Hitler invaded Poland, prevailed and  began enacting his ‘final solution’ for the Jewish community and it was wrong when Israelis drove the Palestinians from their homes on the strength of the arms with support of the US and the UK owing to ideological and racial similarities. Were there reparations? None that I know of but that is the need of the hour - a two state solution with land and monetary reparations to the people of Palestine and an acknowledgement of all the injustices inflicted on them.

Yes, it’ll put the IDF at risk but that is what a responsible state is supposed to do. Israel and their allies have made clear however that Israeli lives are much more valuable than Palestinian lives. Once it starts not treating people like they are animals, perhaps it’ll start getting some local support. It holds all the cards and has to make the first concession.

HRW and Amnesty international have both verified the WAFA news video relating to white phosphorus. Doctors have stated they’ve seen some injuries which may be attributed to the substance. Israel has used the substance earlier in Gaza as well, validated by a different UN agency.

Israel is actually required to preserve civilian life, it has purposefully not signed the required charters so that it might not be subject to the war crimes investigations. It’s supreme court has stated that Israel law can supersede international law or something to that effect. There are so many videos and stories, all verified by international media, where it is clear that no warning was given to the civilians, IDF bulldozing a school while students barely escape, shooting missiles at kids on a beach and claiming a naval facility when international reporters find nothing, blowing up UN schools which are the only places of safe refuge for Palestinians, settlers shooting a young Palestinian kid playing football and many more. 

Not a destabilizing agent, but a threat to peace in the middle east which is Israel. Israel has made itself indispensable through ingenuity and gaining significant political influence in US/UK and can do with Palestinians as it pleases as long as it doesn’t offend too many people.
Israel supported Hamas because RW, Likud and worse, doesn’t want a separate Palestinian state. One could argue that without US and Israel, the middle-east would be much more peaceful than it is today. If not for US overthrowing Iran’s Mosadeq who knows where we’d be today. 

Again, this idea that Israel can punish Gaza for Hamas is hypocritical and in clear contravention of international law. Makes Israel a terrorist nation, Hamas also claims it was punishing Israel for the people it has killed.

We judge Hamas by our standards and give a free-pass to Israel. 

Arab nations/Muslims have been demonized in the western world by the ‘war on terror’ which is why when RW insult left intellectuals they claim they are soft on Islam. I know that western governments don’t care about Palestine or her people, they aren’t white or rich.

Arab nations have been embroiled in conflict after conflict, they usually shout at each other and the world doesn’t bother because Arabs killing Arabs and arabs are cheap. They’re also not subtle, I don’t know what you mean by sophisticated. They’ve not been doing anything to help Palestine btw, apart from the odd statement here or there. If not for those odd statements, there’d be no advocate for Palestinians though so good on them I suppose. Islamophobic, yes - possibly.

Israel is committing the most sophisticated genocide of all time, they’ve influenced international law to their advantage!

I’d look at Al-Jazeera but verify whatever they present with a grain of salt and try to find a few other ‘good’ sources for news that catches my interest. Israeli/US/European news very rarely capture anything from the Arab perspective and very rarely run any news critical of Israel when you yourself know that Israel commits war crimes on the regular.",,
