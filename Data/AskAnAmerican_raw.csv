If this gets out of control I will lock it and start bouncing people out of here.
"Jewish people don't claim being Jewish just as a religion,  it's also ethnicity. If you asked me what my family is I would say I'm Jewish (just like someone would say I'm Irish or Italian). My family immigrated (escaped) from Russia and Poland, but I'm neither of those ancestries.

As such,  American Jews tend to have strong ties to Israel simply because they too are Jewish. There's exchange programs between the countries. Look up Birthright Israel, and also the Maccabi Games. 

From young ages were taught about the Holocaust and what it meant to be killed simply because relatives were Jewish.  Generational trauma. 

This all before even getting to the religious aspect."
"A few things, and for the record I am an Athiest.

1. Hamas and hezbollah are both considered terrorist groups or supportive of terrorist groups by many Americans who are neither Muslim nor Jewish.
2. Israel does tick a lot of the same red flags that Aparthied South Africa did for moderate and Liberal Americans, and non religious conservatives(yes these exist)
3. Hamas' behavior over the last 10 days have basically made them impossible to support.
4. In a calm mood most Americans would freely admit that Palestine has legitimate grevences, and Israel has operated in bad faith.
5. American citizen are being held hostage by Hamas at this moment and until they are returned unharmed no tolerance of Hamas can be considered."
"Well, I’ll say this post was probably made in more good faith than the other one from earlier today."
"Jerusalem and by extension the entire area has been fought over for about 1200~ years by three major religions, Judaism, Islam, and Catholicism. Anyone part of, directly or indirectly, those religions may feel some sort of connection to the conflict on that basis."
"Well as a Jew, our faith is inherently tied to the land. Our prayers always refer to going back to Jerusalem and are tied to the land. All notwithstanding, talk to any Jewish person and you're very, very hard pressed to find any of us who don't have some family member or friends over there, given how small and close knit a community we are and how central the land is to our faith. All notwithstanding that a portion of the population there has always been in Israel since pre-Islamic times. While most Jews are diaspora Jews, Mizrahi were in Israel and the place has always had some Jewish presence.

That's just the explanation I can give for our side of this- not even touching the bit about the Palestinians. And insofar as that's concerned, fact is there are Christian Palestinians, though they're not represented by Hamas. Same with Lebanon, which Israel has fought as well- these ethnic groups actually have substantive Christian segments"
"I'm Jewish and I do have family there, a lot of us do. It's not just a religious thing although that also part of it. Jews are an ethnoreligous group. Even if are most recent non American ancestors were from elsewhere I do think a lot of us feel attachment to it. Many people learn Hebrew (or try to learn and then give it up). 

Israel was founded after the Holocaust during which very few countries were willing to take Jewish refugees(only Dominican Republic agreed to increase number of Jewish immigrants they were taking). Edit: And even going farther back to the early 10th century pogroms in the Russian empire and before that the logic behind Zionism and the creation of Israel.

Many people view it as a safe haven if you need to flee, even if it seems unlikely for that to happen in America."
"It's not just land, it's basically God's hometown and everyone wants to give it back to him"
"Well the land claims are made due to historical religious context, in addition to simple occupation."
"I mean ethno religious groups organizing for causes abroad in the United States is old.  Benito Juarez organized his government in exile when France took over Mexico on the USA border but his wife and family lived in New York and DC meeting President Lincoln.  

An Irish Para militia tried to Invade Canada to liberate it from the Crown

Japanese anarchists attempted to Assasinate Emperor Meji

Sun Yat Sen orchestrated the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty from various secret societies around the world including in Hawaii, San Francisco, and New York.

Look at the anti-Castro sentiment in Miami, or anti-Maduro sentiment among Venezuelans.

Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie became a literal Christ among some Jamaicans/Americans and rallied to him during the Italian occupation"
I ain’t touching this with an 11 foot pole
"Let's just say the First Amendment:

Freedom of Religion, Freedom of Speech, and Freedom of the Press. 

Plus some people like this country because it's the land of opportunity and they can start a business here too!"
"No it’s not about land . Hamas openly says they want all Jews dead . They campaigned on Jewish genocide  16 years ago . If this comment gets deleted by a mod , then I have lost all
Faith in this site . Every time I state a simple truth on this subject I get banned from that room . Facts are facts , wether we like them or not ."
">Why is it that U.S. Muslim/Jewish citizens who are not Palestinian or Israeli nor have family there, feel a personal connection about this? 

As I understand it, some of the holiest sites in the abrahamic religions are in israel or palestine, and we all know how that goes."
"Since every American who doesn’t descend from Native Americans (Indians) is an immigrant from somewhere else, many of us feel a connection to our history just as those who have stayed in their homeland. 

It can be difficult for those who aren’t from a country made almost entirely of immigrants to understand this. 

There’s quite often an attitude of contempt or hostility towards an American who’s “a quarter Irish” for “claiming heritage”. What’s happening with the American in these instances is an attempt to understand where their grandfather came from and establish a bond with their ancestors. 

We’re a nation of people *from somewhere else*."
"I'm in the solid camp that it's not my circus not my monkeys.   


That being said, I wholly support the retaliation of Israel against Hamas. Regardless of the legitimacy of grievances from both sides. Hamas lost any sliver of mercy I had in my heart after they placed launch sites in schools and hospitals back in 2014/5, and exactly 0 of their efforts since then have done anything to reverse that feeling."
"The US doesn’t expect or demand that immigrants abandon an emotional connection to their ancestral homeland nor to their co-religionists in other countries. 

Jews have a centuries old love for the land of Israel, from which most were expelled by the Romans."
"As an American taxpayer, I don't want to fund ethnic cleansing."
"This is about land. A holy land. Of which both of them believe is their holy land. Jews Muslims and Christians all believe Israel is a holy place and all of them have had or still currently have some form of religious beef over who controls it. Theres certainly a political aspect to it, there are many secular Palestinians and Israelis who oppose the other for nonreligious reasons, but the main reason behind the conflict is still religious in nature."
"Speaking on my father's side (he's Muslim), it's because he doesn't approve of the ethnic cleansing/genocide going on. He views it like this as a Bosnian Muslim who witnessed the Bosnian war and the ethnic cleansing of the Bosian Muslims first hand back in the 90s."
"A lot of people in a narcissistic way feel they need to ""do something"" to show how ""good"" they are. I feel that's about all I can say without offending literally everyone, but this is the primary population of people attending a rally/protest for either side."
"It’s way too long of a history lesson to unpack in one Reddit post.  And, you’ll find too many opinions that may or may not be right.   This is something that you should take some time to Google for yourself.   It’s important to do your own research and come to your own conclusions on this so you’re not clouded or confused by what random strangers on the internet think."
"Most of my friends who are Jewish have a loved one or a close friend right now in Israel. I was told that outside the US, Israel has the most amount of people who also have a US passport."
My heart is heavy for all the innocents on both sides.
I'm very ignorant on the issue but I think it's considered the holy land or something it's not just a land dispute between two countries. So it makes sense why some jews and muslims outside the region might still have strong opinions on the subject.
">American citizen are being held hostage by Hamas at this moment and until they are returned unharmed no tolerance of Hamas can be considered.

All else is true, but this is the point that I get stuck on. I don't think there is any return to tolerance for Hamas, even if the hostages are returned unharmed."
"Oh God, what did that one say?"
"It's been way longer than 1200 years, King David conquered the city and declared Jeruslemum the Jewish Capital 1000 BCE. Needless to say it's been known to have conflicts for a long time and everyone has their own dog in the fight."
">and Catholicism

Somewhere in the world right now, there is a Greek Orthodox Christian who is praying that someday people will discover that they exist."
"But three different groups of people all want their own version of God’s hometown. We’ve got:

Jews - they want to build the third temple and bring in the messiah

Evangelical Protestants in the US - they want Jews to migrate to Israel so the rapture can happen and they’ll go to heaven

Muslims - they want to keep their mosque in God’s hometown, which is incidentally built in the same place Jews would like to put the temple."
"I wonder if there's any connection to ""God's hometown"" being on one of the most fertile pieces of  land in a region where the major trade routes linking three continents intersect?"
"""What is Jerusalem worth?"""
"Hamas has like 50% or so support from Palestinians. They willingly elected a political party whose entire existence is to kill Jews, they are literally hitlers wet dream. Just imagine what the rest of the world would think of us if half of our population supported the kkk."
"Many Jewish Americans are pretty connected to Israel. Most of my Jewish friends (and my partner) have friends and family there, and at least one of my close friends had family both murdered and kidnapped.

It also hits **very** close to home for Jewish people to see others murdered simply for being Jewish."
Disagree. ADOS have been here for centuries and unfortunately most of us don't feel any connection to Africa at all. We are thoroughly American.
"Hmm, weren't the majority already living outside the land by that time (the diaspora)?"
What do you want Israel to do? Israel isn’t gathering up civilians and murdering them.
"Okay, well would you say the ""genocide"" is occurring because Palestinians are Muslim or because they are not Jewish?"
"What baffles me is people care so much about something they know so little about. Questions like OPs are searching for the logic or reason behind which side someone supports, but most people are incredibly ignorant about the geopolitics of the Middle East, and most likely support the side they do due to their social circle."
"Ive done research. I am actively doing research. My question was to ask Muslim and Jewish United States citizens their PERSONAL connection to this situation. Therefore yes I want peoples opinions. So lets just say, Im creating something for the next person to research."
Why do you support Palestine when you’re gay if Hamas wants you dead (essentially).
Focusing more on the religious conflicts arising from the birth of Christianity.

"Um, as a Catholic, I’ve been told my ENTIRE LIFE that we are the world’s oldest Christian religion?! Is there debate on that?"
WOW. This helps sm.
"And the funny thing is that all three of them are doing the same thing, waiting for an Elijah character."
"From what I understand (which is still limited), it is specifically Zionist Jews that want that. Not all Jewish people."
"Catholics in the US are also taught the land belongs to the Jews. Although, we differ on the rapture. And Al Aqsa is built on the temple of David just like the Turks built a mosque on the Hagia Sofia(world’s oldest Catholic Church). Unfortunately, because Islam sprang from Christianity, we have many holy sites in common. They loved to build mosques on top of the everything"
"If you were God and you wanted to eventually establish a worldwide religion, ""a region where the major trade routes linking three continents intersect"" would be a good place to start."
Now that's just crazy talk
You speak for all of them?
"They very much are now. They’ve told them to leave one part of Gaza and go to the southern part of Gaza all while bombing the south. The Israelis are targeting schools and medical facilities that are usually used as safe havens. And everyone knows that historically once Palestinians leave their homes they never ever get them back. So by saying that if they stay in their homes they are likely to be killed the Israelis are rounding up civilians and killing them. Because now these people have a choice. Either they leave their home and everything they own or they die. Do you know what you would choose? Because I don’t. And collective punishment is a war crime. 

My partner is Jewish. We know and love people in Israel. I was and am very upset by Hamas’s attack on innocent people. I want Israel to have a reasonable reaction to it. This is not reasonable. This is not just. But almost nothing the Israeli government does is.

Edit: I want to add that there are US citizens in Gaza that are in serious danger that cannot leave."
"As if that's the only way to kill people. I want Israel to respect Palestine's right to their land, and if they can't do that, they need to respect their right to live. Israel is the powerhouse in this battle, I think we need to wary of any news that suggests otherwise. We've seen over the last week or two how Western media has extreme bias in their coverage as (""Israelis are killed vs Palestinians have died"" language). Examples of how Israel can commit ethnic cleansing without rounding up civilians and murdering them:

[Israel Bulldozes Palestinian Homes](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/world/israel-ramps-up-demolition-of-palestinian-homes-in-jerusalem)

[Israel Cuts Off Essential Resources](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/show/gaza-cut-off-from-food-water-and-fuel-as-israels-punishing-bombardment-continues)

[Israel Blockades Gaza](https://www.unicef.org/mena/documents/gaza-strip-humanitarian-impact-15-years-blockade-june-2022)

The fact that anyone who defends Palestine is labeled as an anti-semite is a huge red flag to me as this opens the door for crimes to go uncriticized or unnoticed.

I remain open to new information, as I think we all should. All that I've seen makes the full scale invasion of Gaza look like an act of genocide rather than an act of war."
"If you were to ask me, I'd say it's more unfortunate apathy towards Muslims, especially in the west during a post 9/11 era (neo-orientalism), especially with the ""threat"" of the ""other."" There's definitely been a resurgance in that way of thinking with this event just as we've seen another surge in antisemitic rhetoric, hand-in-hand. 

But in the case of Israel, I can't comment on why this is being being carried out. I have my own theories, but all I can comment on is what I see based on past historical context both in this situation and in others similar to it. I just can't claim to be an expert on it.

Edit: clicked enter too early, oops"
That is a valid question
1000+ years of Muslim rule will do that.
"Catholics say that they are the oldest church and that the Orthodox split off from them in 1054. Orthodox say that they are the oldest church and that Catholics split off from them in 1054.

Either way, well before then, the church had kind of split into the Greek speaking and the Latin speaking rites. They were still in communion with each other until 1054, but their liturgies and customs were diverging. After the Great Schism, the majority of western, Latin speaking congregations joined the Roman Catholic Church (usually just called Catholic) and the majority of eastern, Greek speaking congregations joined the Orthodox Catholic Church (usually called Eastern Orthodox).

The Greek churches bore the brunt of the Early Muslim conquests while the church was still unified, then after the split, there was pretty frequent conflict between the Orthodox and Muslims with Catholics joining in every time there was a crusade."
"We are but the orthodox are in a sense depending on how you define it. Orthodox view us as splitting off the original church while we view them.

Protestants however came way later with most of their churches founded in the 1500s or even more recently."
It would also be a good choice for overlords and conman.
What’s a reasonable reaction?
"My point is Israel is in a lose lose situation here. No matter what they do people are going to give them way more shit.

Again I propose the question, what do you want Israel to do? Because the response shouldn’t be nothing. I don’t see what response you’d want them to have that you wouldn’t call shitty. It’s war, it’s going to be shit no matter what.

But I’m personally not going to defend the side explicitly killing civilians.

I think the fact that other Arab nations aren’t willing to take the refugees makes it pretty clear that this isn’t the cut and dry thing you want it to be."
"As a gay man, I don’t think it is."
"Honestly, I have no idea what a reasonable action would be. But I can't just shrug and say ""welp, sucks to be them, but it is what it is""."
Ok you can support some one who would kill you for gay if you want
"Wait wait wait …. You just said that you don’t think Hamas  would want you dead because you are gay ??? Is that seriously what you just said ? Oh dear child , 🤦‍♀️. Son please educate yourself on the subject and I don’t mean by asking your college friends . And whatever you do do not approach a member of Hamas and tell them you are gay … lol"
"It really is like that, the most any of us can do."
How did we make the leap from the Palestinian people to the *organization* of Hamas?
Where did I say I don’t think Hamas would want me dead for being gay. Please show me where I said that.
Hamas has like 50% support from Palestinians
"You really think that’s a big leap ? It’s the same as if  say for example an army of 200,000 American  democrats attacked and killed a thousand  idk , let’s say Orange people …. People from other countries would say Americans attacked and killed the Orange people …. They wouldn’t be like “ democrats from California killed the Orange people “ lol get it ?"
They’re the same thing
"Sweet Jesus child , scroll up
, you just said it to another poster !  I. This same thread ! Lol. Somebody asked you what the other post was about … you said it was about “ why do you support Hamas if your gay and they want you dead .” The other poster said that was a valid question and you said , and I quote “ AS A GAY MAN I DONT THINK IT IS “  If you meant something other than what  your comment  says  than you are the only one that understands what you meant . The other poster said “ ok fine if you want to support a group that wants you dead “ ….  I took got the same thing from your comment as he did . That you support Hamas and don’t think they would want you dead for being gay ."
"Of a group of people where 40% are under the age of 14?

Hamas has also violently suppressed opposition to them in the 16 years they (violently) took control."
"I don’t get your comment. 

I have yet to see any news coverage of the current situation that hasn’t specified this atrocity was committed by Hamas. If radical democrats did do such a thing, I 100% believe coverage of this would say “radical Democrats from California killed orange people” and not “Californians killed orange people”. 

I mean, in the US when we talk about White Supremest doing something we don’t cover it as simply “white people” and none of us think it’s indicative of all white people."
"No, they’re not. How are they?"
"Yes, I said “I don’t think it is” as in “I don’t think it’s a valid question”."
"They willingly elected Hamas in 2006, an organization thats entire existence is to kills Jews.

The adults in Palestine are largely responsible for this as well."
Hamas is a government branch of a Palestine territory . Hamas are  Palestinians.  Where is the stretch you speak of ?
"The Palestinian crowds cheered the murder of innocent Israeli civilians, grandmothers and children. At the big pro Palestine protests in the west they cheered the death of Israeli civilians proclaiming ""gas the Jews""."
They support hamas so they are part of it
You don’t think  a valid question is “ why do you support Hamas if they would want you dead ?” It’s a very valid question
"I’m honestly confused about what point your trying to make. 

Obviously Hamas is made up of Palestinians since they’re an organization in Palestine. I don’t understand how understand that Palestinians have been fucked over for 70 something years is co-signing the actions of Hamas. Two things can be true at the same time."
"Question, what are your thoughts on this:

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/world/israeli-crowds-chant-racist-slogans-taunt-palestinians-during-jerusalem-day-march

I also don’t see what protests in the west and any antisemitism that occurs there have to do with the situation in Israel and Palestine."
"1. I’m curious how you came to that conclusion. 

2. I guess by this logic I shouldn’t care or support the people of Utah and fuck all should happen to them since they support a government and have people in power who aren’t exactly LGBTQ friendly."
">You don’t think  a valid question is “ why do you support Hamas if they would want you dead ?”

You rephrased the original question. I never said anything about supporting Hamas."
Your getting a lot of wrong information . If I was tech savvy I’d send you some links to educate you on this . I’m a lot older than you . My grandfather fought in WW2 to put an end to the holocaust and his brother died in the war to do the same . I know things you don’t kiddo .
"Oh, so it’s “trust me bro” and you’re not tech savvy enough to copy and paste and link. 

Both my grandfathers fought in WW2 as well, so idk what kind of flex that is or how that gives you inside knowledge."
"Did you talk to your grandfather about it in depth ? I did . Was your entire family effected because your family member died in the battle of the bulge  fighting the Nazis ?  No you didn’t , because you would t have made the idiotic comment that Hamas would not kill you for being gay . Kid that told me everything I needed to know there about how uneducated you are on the subject ."
">Did you talk to your grandfather about it in depth ? I did . Was your entire family effected because your family member died in the battle of the bulge  fighting the Nazis ?  

I honestly don’t understand the point of this. 

>No you didn’t , because you would t have made the idiotic comment that Hamas would not kill you for being gay . Kid that told me everything I needed to know there about how uneducated you are on the subject .

Again, please show me where I said Hamas would not kill me for being gay?"
"I just sent it to you . Unless you meant something entirely different , but to me and the other poster , we took the same thing from what you said"
I don’t think you and the other poster interpreted my response the same tbh.
Ok let’s try this . Answer my questions with yes or no . Do you support Hamas ? Do you think that Hamas would not wish you ill for being a gay man ?
"No, I don’t support Hamas. I never said anything about supporting Hamas. I never made any allusions to supporting Hamas. I never once made any statement about supporting Hamas in any literal or hypothetical sense."
"Well I sure wish you had said that sooner , cause none of this conversation would have happened . Lol .."
"I didn’t think I had to since, as I already stated, nothing I said even alluded to being in support of the organization."
"You are the only one that knew that’s what you were saying …. Uuuhhhggggg . You know I always say that social media is the cancer that destroyed  civilization. And I have no social media … no FB , no Instagram , no nothing . I got on this app cause I’m recovering from breaking my neck  and I can’t move around much . So what happens , I get on social media and get in an argument with a stranger , that wasn’t even an actual argument because everything got lost in social
Media translation ….. I can’t wait till I heal and go back to work …. Lol … have a good night. And I sincerely apologize for the misunderstanding."
"I honestly don’t accept your apology because you tried to quote me as saying thing I did not say, and were very condescending throughout this exchange (I’m still understand why you started talking about grandfathers and WW2 and tried to see which one of ours was more affected by it as if it were a competition)."
"It was not a competition with our grandfathers . If yours served as well than they are every bit the hero mine were for doing what they did .  When I thought you were saying you didn’t think Hamas would wish you harm ,  I said there was no way you had spoken at length with anyone about the war and when you spoke of stolen land .. I knew I was right about that . You do realize Isreal didn’t steal land , that they were born there … Jesus was a Jew . And the British divided the land at the end of the war . The land the Jews were chased out of . The “
Palestians were not happy with the division of land . Even though they were given the more fertile land . The Jews took their desert land and turned it into gold with their knowledge of aquaducts. They even learned how to grow orchards of fruit with saltwater . They turned a desert into profit and the palestines took their land and pouted about  the Jews getting any land and focused on death and destruction . Everybody has it in for Jews.  They are constantly fighting to just live .  Imagine being surrounded by people that openly tell you everyday they want you dead . And You seem to refuse to look at what you said from other peoples view . I’m not the only one that misunderstood your standpoint .  I gave my apology you didn’t accept it , so be it . God Bless and let’s hope for brighter days for all the innocents on both sides  across the world"
Ps I didn’t quote you as saying something different than you said . I quoted it word for word . It was your meaning that was different from what you said
"I don’t deny Jesus was a Jew, that Jews have a cultural tie to that area, and I admit that Jews have always been present there even before the creation of Isreal. 

But I’m curious (especially as an American) to know if you if your support also extends to other groups of people who have cultural and historic claim to an area and I’d you feel they too have a right to the land."
"https://reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/s/Iz5QmzblRx

You quoted me “word for word” with this statement I never once utilized? None of my comments have been edited and all of my comments are still up. Maybe you don’t know the meaning of “word for word”?"
"That wasn’t what you said , that was what the other poster said 🤦‍♀️. That was the question of the other poster paraphrased . I believe he said group instead of Hamas. When I quoted YOU it was word for word . You are all confused  I think we can end this conversation now . There is no point to it any longer ."

"Where I live, the Armenian genocide and diaspora is a serious topic with frequent demonstrations

I’ve spent a lot of time talking about Brexit and the state of the UK

I think people, both well-informed and misinformed, spend a lot of time talking about Central America"
"""What to do about China"" gets people pretty riled up. 

Also we have long had a lot of simmering conflict with Mexico related to immigration, which more recently has extended through Central America and now definitely includes Venezuela and a couple other South American countries.

Frankly anything to do with the Middle East gets heated. Our relationship with Saudi Arabia, our conflicts with Iran, etc."
One heated issue I know of is whether we should maintain our embargo on Cuba.
"What to do about Russia in Ukraine is getting pretty heated, between those who want to help Ukraine and those who worry about either the expense or worry it may trigger World War III.

China is always a hot button item, be it what's happening in Taiwan or in Tibet.

Beyond that I don't know anything that is particularly heated--beyond the usual political nonsense of disagreeing with the other party because the other party is wrong--regardless of what the other party is doing. (I mean, the Republicans could say ""the sky is blue"" and it'd create heated debate over how it can be brown or green or dark and how anti-science are these asshats anyways, and do you want people to die in tornados because they don't know what sky colors to look for?)"
I'm not sure if there are any real examples outside of whatever is in the news cycle at the time that the different parties have taken opposing sides on.
Right now? Ukraine and Russia. Specifically the money going to fund Ukraine. Which is ridiculous. We made security assurances to them in the Budapest Memorandum and the fact that a large majority of people don't care about that is concerning.
"The war in Iraq still plays a crucial role in a lot of people's political opinions, especially those of us who are old enough to remember the lead-up to the war. Zoomers and Gen A probably don't fully appreciate just how deeply divisive it was, and how many of those scars remain, especially when debating foreign policy and America's larger role in the world."
"What to do about Iran, because our stances on Iran shift depending on whose president, and from what party.

And the Iranian government of course takes advantage of this, running lobbying and Russia-style disinformation campaigns."
"Immigration, including those who advocate for open borders against those who advocate for controlled immigration with screening and verification that those who come in, contribute to society through language, skills, and abiding by laws"
"I grew up in an area with a majority Asian population (East Asian and South Asian), with a minority of white people and very few other minorities (black, hispanic, muslim, etc.)

Racial issues can get very interesting. IMO national discourse tends to be framed as ""black vs. white"" (or occasionally ""hispanic vs. white""), and often no one in the room identifies with either of those races."
"Ukraine, China, Iran, and Mexico. And that's about it.

I'm not going to take positions on any of these but you get a lot of discussion over whether or not we should support Ukraine, what to do about China, with which we have a number of serious problems, Iran, because of a fairly ugly history with that country, and Mexico because of immigration and drugs. 

Discussions of China and Mexico involve what to do about problems that most reasonable people agree exist. Discussions about Ukraine, the Middle East in general, and Iran in particular tend to be ugly and are frequently conducted in bad faith. We have to deal with Mexico because it's right next door and problems there really can't be denied or avoided. Ukraine tends to be an uglier topic because people disagree about whether or not we should even be involved there."
"The Poomeister, Winnie the Pooh, whatever Cuba and Venezuela are up to, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, France if they’re in ha mood, maybe Germany if they’re doing EU-shenanigans, oh and that fat kid who loves rockets"
"Mexico (border), China, Israel, Russia/Ukraine, Cuba, Saudi Arabia in that order give or take.

EDIT: Iran and North Korea too, but those people tend to forget out unless they do something to make the news."
Immigration through our southern neighbors can get pretty heated.
"Uh, all of them lol"
Putin sympathizers are not looked at kindly where I live. Its particularly hot because a local of ours went over to volunteer to help.
"Israel/Palestine tends to be more unifying than most other foreign policy issues, actually.  The heat is coming from a vocal minority.

The hot topics that actually divide people into two real camps generally revolve around immigration and trade (how free it should be and with whom).  Actual interventions (as opposed to various kinds of aid) will also generate some heated discussions, but all the actual US-troops-fighting-in-another-country stuff the US is involved in at the moment is relateively low-key and flying under the radar.  I'd say most people are not aware we have troops in Niger, for example.  Most have probably forgotten we still have people in Syria, for that matter.  And in Ukraine, as well.  The perception is that they ""aren't really fighting"".  I doubt that's completely accurate in any of those cases.

Aid tends to be at the discretion of whoever is in charge at the moment, and while there are differences of opinion, it doesn't get as much traction as the dissenters from the president's policy would like.

Outside of those - the Iran Nuclear deal (or no deal) is probably the most heated debate going at the moment, and it's just gotten put on the very back burner with the recent excitement in the Levant."
"Immigration is one of the most heated, frustrating, and just kinda dumb political debates we have. 

It’s easy to forget 10,000 bat crap crazy Donald Trump stories later, but being harsh on immigration and building a border wall were basically Trump’s only concrete policies when he started his 2016 campaign. 

It’s a really frustrating debate because so many people get the basic facts and terms wrong. 

Some basic facts people miss: People are legally allowed to cross the border to seek asylum. Only an estimated 50% of illegal immigrants crossed the border illegally. It’s just as common to overstay a legal visa as cross illegally. Illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans. Illegal immigrants pay taxes and don’t get benefits, which has made them pretty much indispensable to the way the economies of California and Texas currently operate.

I also just think it’s weird that opposing immigration seems to motivate voters nationally. The majority of illegal immigrants go to just 4 states, so I’m not sure why anybody in Wisconsin, Ohio, West Viriginia, or Colorado would care. 

Lastly, it’s just frustrating that nobody seems to have any interest in reform. The Republican agenda just seems to be “make the experience of being an immigrant shittier” and the Democratic agenda seems to be “kick the can down the road”.

The whole thing just pisses me off."
 Americans usually don’t pay attention to foreign countries problems when it doesn’t involve us(most people simply don’t have time to worry about foreign problems when we have problems of our own).  The Ukraine Russia conflict and other types of foreign aid(humanitarian aid or weapons supplies)  cause problems because many Americans believe we should be spending our money on our own people instead of foreigners.

"Does Israel/Palestine get heated in the US? Granted, I haven't lived in America in 6 years now, but I never actually saw pro-palestine anything until I moved to Europe. And I'm from Michigan, so I'm actually from a state with a sizable muslim population."
"People who aren't Jewish/Arab don't know what the fuck they're talking about when it comes to Israel/Palestine anyhow. I'm sick of pussyfooting around it, they just don't. Until a week ago, most people didn't understand that Hamas are a terrorist group. All of them should stop pretending they actually know what goes on there."
Now *this* is interesting because it's both international and hyperlocal. Around me I kept running into people who didn't know what the Armenia genocide even was.
"I guess it also helps that a major local band, System Of A Down, has been an outspoken advocate of discussions and recognition of the genocide. They even performed in Armenia itself on the 100th anniversary."
">I’ve spent a lot of time talking about Brexit and the state of the UK

How much coverage did Brexit receive in the US?

A lot of Americans I have met fell into the trap of thinking of Boris Johnson as the British Trump. They share some superficial similarities but Brexit is too big to be defined by one man alone."
How many people still feel that strong about Cuba though? It's basically just Cuban Americans these days.
">the fact that a large majority of people don't care about that is concerning.

I blame our culture of insularity."
"And then the third camp who want to block all immigration and eject those already granted stays here.

"I respect much of what you said but I think you’re misconstruing some points that the anti immigration crowd makes:

>people are legally allowed to cross the border to seek asylum 

Yes…but the issue is that there is a large cohort of immigrants abusing asylum claims when they’re coming for economic reasons, which is not what asylum was designed for. I absolutely empathize with people who want a better life and better wages, but wanting to make more money or being poor in and of itself is not a qualifier for asylum. And it becomes a problem when you have so many people making those claims that the system is bogged down and can’t adjudicate who is a valid asylum seeker and who isn’t in an efficient manner, which hurts people who actually qualify more than anything. 

>illegal immigrants pay taxes 

In some cases, yes. For asylum seekers, since many can’t seek employment legally they aren’t paying taxes though. And given the budgets cities like NYC, DC and Chicago are spending on migrants, I find it difficult to believe it’s as positive as you make it sound. And it’s also worth noting that the demographics of illegals immigrants has changed - it used to be mostly working aged Mexican men who came up to find a job and send money to their family home. It is now predominantly Venezuelan, Cuban, and Central American families coming and that changes the picture. When you’re enrolling 3 kids in public schools and CHIPS etc, that has a pretty large effect on the net taxes you pay to the system. Finally on this note, paying taxes doesn’t absolve you of crimes or infractions. I’ve gotten speeding tickets and red light camera tickets before, am I suddenly not allowed to face the consequences because I pay taxes? That’s just not how that works 

>most only go to 4 states 

Most actors and writers only live in 4 states too (probably 80% are in California & NY tbh). Am I not allowed to care about the strike? Most violent crime happens in a handful of cities and red states, am I not allowed to have an opinion on gun control? I do not buy the argument that because there aren’t as many immigrants in Wisconsin or West Virginia that those folks aren’t allowed to have opinions on it. It’s their country too."
"> Lastly, it’s just frustrating that nobody seems to have any interest in reform. The Republican agenda just seems to be “make the experience of being an immigrant shittier” and the Democratic agenda seems to be “kick the can down the road”.

I feel this happens with almost all political issues (see: student debt), but I fully agree.

It's frustrating to see the whole spectrum of nuanced solutions in between get compressed to a binary of either ""we should accept anyone with open arms"" and ""deport anyone with melanin"""
">People are legally allowed to cross the border to seek asylum.

This is a common misconception. Asylum-seekers *are* supposed to cross at a legal point of entry. Crossing the border illegally doesn’t invalidate a potential asylum claim, but it is still illegal.

>Only an estimated 50% of illegal immigrants crossed the border illegally.

The disproportionate focus on illegal crossings is because people with expired visas were at least vetted somewhat.

>Illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans.

Most crimes are within-group, and thus most crimes committed by illegal immigrants are against other illegal immigrants, who are often afraid to report crimes for fear of being deported (although in reality they would not normally be deported for reporting a crime, even outside sanctuary jurisdictions)."
"There were several protests and counter-protests across the States, Harvard students were doxed after writing an anti-Israel letter, a Palestinian child was attacked in a hate crime, some have lost their jobs"
"Los Angeles has the largest Armenian population outside of Armenia, so it tracks. I met one Armenian-American friend in college back east. Living here in California, I couldn’t count how many folks I’ve met. The culture a very real part of the local fabric, and there are frequent protests re: acknowledging the genocide (street corners, city halls, shutting down the freeways).

There is also just a bounty of delicious Armenian food, but that’s another post and question."
"> major local band

Bit of an understatement there, but yeah SOAD is how I even learned about the Armenian genocide when I started listening to them in '98-99. To be fair I was 13, but I might have remained in ignorance much longer if it wasn't for them."
All four SOAD members are Armenian-American.
"It was a topic well covered in the news and by late night comedy

My partner and I (and when spending time with our parents) talked extensively about it for what felt like a long time

My partner and I spend a lot of time talking about British political culture in general"
"I've met Americans who fell into the trap of thinking of Trump as the sole reason the modern conservative party is ""like that"", when really the madness is too big to be defined by one man. Attributing large, sweeping political movements to one guy is pretty common."
"Yes, but Cuban Americans are politically valuable."
I’ll have to research any politician that has publicly stated they will block ALL immigration and eject those granted stay here because that is an extreme position that will never win any seat
"There’s absolutely activists circles that advocate for that.
And generally, I think most countries want immigrants to be part of society including being able to communicate and participate in it rather than stay in isolated enclaves ."
I think he's talking about North Korea
"All good points. I want to support your post, because you're absolutely right that I focused more on misconceptions that favored my preferred solution. 

My response to the idea of bogus asylum claims is that that would be a place for legal reform, not physical barriers. A wall doesn't differentiate between who does and doesn't have a legitimate claim. 

Good point on the benefits. Kids absolutely do get to go to public school and get food assistance. I personally taught hundreds of them, I can confirm that. 

On the idea of facing consequences, I think it really depends on how we frame it. We can frame it as ""you did a crime, you should face consequences."" But I would appreciate a more realistic framing of ""you have every incentive in the world to do this, so what are we going to do about it?"" Because they're coming no matter what. 

As for the last one, that's one of my more controversial opinions, but yes, I do think you need a minimum amount of knowledge and skin in the game to have an opinion. With, immigration specifically I feel like the discourse has been poisoned by people who don't know things about the immigration system and don't know any immigrants themselves who fall for obvious lies."
But they do pay taxes. Sales tax.
"What is this ""delicious Armenian food"", because when I hear ""Armenian food"" I immediately think of khash, which it seems like a lot of Caucasians themselves think is gross"
"True. 

I think the poster's point is that, I don't know if it's too heated IRL, because basically everybody outside of Florida agrees that the embargo is a failed policy and even if the embargo worked, we are allies with countries way, way worse than Cuba. 

It's just that a lot of politicians have to pretend to not know that to campaign in Florida."
"Honestly, not anymore. They all live in Florida and Florida is rapidly becoming, if it hasn't already become one, a Republican hellhole."
It seems to me there was some nutball politician here in Arizona who wanted to ban all imigration.
"Eject those granted stays refers to the old DACA/Dreamer fights which did have plenty of opponents calling for their deportation.

For blocking immigration, you just need to look at Trump and his sycophants."
"Genuinely curious if you can name some specific examples of ""activist circles"" that explicitly advocate for open borders?"
"It may be Armenian diaspora food, but the food my Armenian-Russian (now American) friend would provide when hosting (or his mom would cook for us) was always delicious. 

The one thing that always stands out to me was khatchapuri"
"Florida is doing fine from what I have seen and heard. I guess it depends to what politics you prescribe too, but in reality, Florida's economy is doing great, and Republicans seem to keep on gaining ground in that state. I don't like California, but if the people seem to keep voting Democratic in that state obviously there are things that are working for that state that might not work for others."
"Oh yeah, that ship has *sailed*."
Not everyone seeking a sane immigration program is a Trump supporter.
"How specific do you need? 

I know from being around a lot of activists during the May Day Rallies in Los Angeles around 2006-2009, protests of Joe Arpaio in Arizona in the 2010s, the protest against SB 1070. I hung out and met a lot within that circle and there was a loose collective of activists that had some pretty radical ideologies including no borders, all indigenous are able to cross freely, etc. Of course they also lean heavily left wing, so yeah. Not big on borders, nationalities, etc."
Khachapuri is Georgian...
I didn't say that. I said those looking to block immigration.
"Like I said, Armenian diaspora"

"~~First, please read a book on elementary-level reading comprehension - I said his sycophants. Meaning those desperate for his endorsement.~~

Apologies, I forgot I said ""Trump *and*"" 

But, since you mentioned him, here you go:

- Trump [supports bill to halve legal immigration](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/us/politics/trump-immigration.html)

- Trump states that immigration reform will result in legal immigrants [""taking jobs"" and ""taking votes""](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/03/06/trump-warns-gop-on-immigration-theyre-taking-your-jobs/)

- Trump implies immigrants are ['snakes waiting to bite'](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-rally-ohio-migrant-children-b1873438.html)

- And of course, the perennial quote:

> When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.

Now that's it, we're done."
