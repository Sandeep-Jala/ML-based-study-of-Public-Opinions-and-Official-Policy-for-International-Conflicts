## STATS 507

In response to the escalating global discourse surrounding the Israel-Palestine conflict, this project scrutinizes the disjunction between official policies and public
sentiments, specifically within the realm of social media, with a focus on Reddit.
Targeting key global subreddits, we extract and analyze posts and comments using keywords from diverse news outlets.
Our primary objectives include deriving insights into public opinion on the Israel-Palestine conflict, determining the optimal machine learning model for conflict-specific classification, and assessing the proficiency of the GPT-3.5 model inaccurately classifying textual data. Through this analysis, we aim to offer valuable contributions to understanding public sentiment dynamics in a complex geopolitical issue. By studying social media platforms like Reddit, we can better understand how public opinion on the Israel-Palestine conflict is shaped and expressed. This analysis
allows us to identify discussion patterns and trends, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of public sentiment surrounding this complex geopolitical issue. Ultimately, our
goal is to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the conflict and its impact on society.
